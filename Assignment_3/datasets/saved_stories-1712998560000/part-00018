But they left the\nUnited States in search of a quality of life that\u2019s no longer in reach for\nthem stateside. Now, the clear blue waters of Rosarito Beach are quickly\nbecoming home.\n\nTheir condo is just the right size for two. It\u2019s intimate but not without its\nluxuries, like a huge bathtub with jacuzzi jets. Then there\u2019s their balcony,\noverlooking a world of ocean that bleeds into the horizon. It\u2019s a view\nreserved for millionaires and billionaires in the US, but not here.\n\n\u2018There are children here who do not want to be black\u2019: one woman\u2019s bid to save\nMexico\u2019s first Afro-Mexican museum\n\nRead more\n\n\u201cWe are immigrants. And I think it\u2019s disingenuous to call us anything else,\u201d\nJym said. \u201cWhen I decided that I wanted to move out of the US, it was eyes\nwide open with that word in mind. I am an immigrant.\u201d\n\nIf the Varnadores\u2019 life in Mexico is a choice, they say that moving away from\nSan Diego wasn\u2019t. Jym had been working his way through biweekly bill payments\nwhen he decided to check in on his 401(k) and social security. As he started\ncrunching the numbers, he found that \u2013 after retirement in a matter of years \u2013\nthey would be able to afford either groceries or the mortgage on their condo,\nbut not both.\n\nHis epiphany coincided with the 2016 presidential election, a political train\nwreck that had also been bothering Jym. But when he called Renee over to talk,\nthe question he posed was first and foremost about financial planning.\n\nThey had two options, he told her: stay in San Diego and substantially lower\ntheir standard of living, or leave the city she had resided in for most of her\nlife.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna move,\u201d Renee said, without missing a beat.\n\nSo they started scouring the US for a new home \u2013 maybe Oregon, or northern\nCalifornia, or Seattle. Renee would look up real estate prices online, and\noften, they\u2019d go scout especially promising locations in person. They even\nvisited Hawaii \u2013 another place mainlanders flock to, not without controversy \u2013\nand found a potential property there, but the cost ended up being much the\nsame as their expenses in San Diego, defeating the purpose.\n\nJym and Renee Varnadore, with their cat, Paz, in their condo. Photograph:\nCarlos Moreno/The Guardian\n\nOne day, Renee came to Jym, despondent. The only places they could afford\nlong-term in the US either had terrible weather, terrible politics or \u2013 she\nfelt \u2013 no culture.\n\nIt was time to start thinking beyond the US\u2019s all-too-limiting borders. Soon,\nthey were looking south.\n\nIt\u2019s true that San Diego tends to drain its residents\u2019 pocketbooks,\ncontinuously ranking high among US cities with the most expensive housing\ncosts. Amid a deepening housing shortage, plus dwindling state and federal\nfunding to produce and preserve local housing, the southern California\nmetropolis\u2019s typical home value has reached nearly $1m.\n\nRenters in the area have to make almost three times the city\u2019s minimum wage\njust to pay the average monthly rent, while roughly a third of homeowners\nexist at or beyond the boundary of the federal definition for cost-burdened,\nspending 30% or more of their household income on monthly property costs\nalone.\n\nBut similar circumstances exist across the US. Nearly half of Americans say\nthat the availability of affordable housing is a major problem in their\ncommunities, and even during a Covid-induced economic downturn, the price tag\nfor a single-family home has soared over the last few years. Rents have\nsoared, too, turning something as basic as reliable shelter into a luxury\naround the country.\n\nSuch a lack of viable housing options for so many Americans is just one of\nmyriad signs pointing to growing inequalities. Among those whose families make\nless than $100,000, nearly one in 10 cannot get the medical care they need\nbecause of the cost. And as the middle class shrinks, both income and wealth\ninequality have surged higher in the US than in nearly any other developed\nnation.\n\nThese systemic failings exact a heavy toll on the US\u2019s ageing and elderly, who\nare rapidly comprising more and more of the country\u2019s population. Almost half\nof families in the US have no retirement account savings whatsoever, while\nmore than 15 million Americans aged 65 or over are considered economically\ninsecure. \u201cThe retirement system does not work for most workers,\u201d according to\nthe Economic Policy Institute \u2013 especially not for Black, Latino, lower-income\nand non-college-educated Americans, though it often fails more affluent, white\nprofessionals as well.\n\nOverburdened by student loans, medical bills and other near-constant financial\ndrains, some older Americans have reconciled themselves with the morbid\nreality that living in the US with so few safety nets means they will need to\nwork until the day they die.\n\nOthers with the agency to make a choice have been unwilling to accept this\nbleak future \u2013 and have started seeking security and opportunity elsewhere.\nTheir path \u2013 punctuated by bureaucratic hurdles and cultural adjustments \u2013 is\nnot always as easy or romantic as it may seem. Yet even so, it can be worth\nthe peace and security that comes next.\n\nNo one visits the Contreras\u2019s house in Baja California, Mexico, without\nletting out a \u201cwow\u201d. The view from their huge deck is what elicits such a\nstrong reaction \u2013 smack-dab on the Pacific Ocean, deep blue water all around\nand waves crashing just below. The word \u201cparadise\u201d immediately comes to mind.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky. We\u2019re very, very lucky,\u201d Mary Contreras said from her\nimmaculately curated living room.\n\nSurrounded by such humbling expanse and calm, it\u2019s hard to imagine anywhere\nsomeone would rather be. Yet for decades, when Mary traveled to Mexico for\ngetaways, she had never thought that she and her husband, Chuck, would end up\nhere full time. After all, they had roots back in the US. She was an educator\nand fourth-generation Californian. He worked for a non-profit, providing\nassistance dogs to kids and adults. They lived in Carlsbad, California, for\nthe better part of three decades.\n\nRosarito Beach is a destination for locals and Americans living nearby, with\nlive music, lounging and snacks. Photograph: Carlos Moreno/The Guardian\n\nAfter a great career helping people, Chuck had every intention to meet his\ngoal of retirement before the age of 60. But on Mary\u2019s salary alone, in an\neconomy that doesn\u2019t value education as much as other professions, they\ncouldn\u2019t realistically continue thriving in the community they called home,\nwhere she had served so many other families as an English teacher and\nprincipal.\n\n\u201cThat I can\u2019t continue living there \u2013 having worked my entire life and worked\nhard \u2013 that to me is just like, something\u2019s wrong. Something\u2019s really wrong,\u201d\nMary said.\n\n\u201cI feel incredibly blessed and fortunate to be living here,\u201d she said of her\nlife in Mexico. \u201cI love living here. So it\u2019s not that,\u201d she quickly clarified.\nBut \u201cevery now and then I get in touch with some anger ... We had a beautiful\nhome up there, and we had a beautiful life there. And why that couldn\u2019t\ncontinue?\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Renee taught English and drama to middle schoolers and high\nschoolers in California for more than a decade. Jym, meanwhile, comes from a\nmilitary family and spent years in intelligence for the navy, working in the\ninformational nerve center of a ship.\n\nYou can take the boy out of the navy, but you can\u2019t take the navy out of the\nboy, as Jym says. So when, during tours of Mexican real estate, he walked into\na unit where he could see the vastness of the ocean through a floor-to-ceiling\nglass wall \u2013 in a huge apartment with a price tag far below what they were\npaying for their condo in San Diego \u2013 he turned to Renee and told her he was\nready to sign a lease.\n\n\u201cI love it, I live for it. People write songs about this stuff, you know? \u2018The\nsea\u2019s in my veins. My tradition remains.\u2019 It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true,\u201d Jym said.\n\nFor Renee, the decision to move to Rosarito Beach wasn\u2019t so easy. She didn\u2019t\nhave particularly fond memories of Mexico, a country that for her was defined\nby a family vacation gone awry and uncomfortable drives to Tijuana as a\nteenager for orthodontics. Plus, the look and feel of Rosarito bothered her \u2013\nrusted-out houses on the brink of collapse, juxtaposed right next to luxury\nhigh-rises where many of the expats lived.\n\nBut then, Renee started to connect with Rosarito\u2019s more humane approach to \u2013\namong other issues \u2013 homelessness. There, unhoused people\u2019s possessions were\nnot trashed and disrespected in the kinds of police sweeps that often defined\nlife on the streets in San Diego, and meanwhile, Baja California was jam-\npacked with community-based organizations doing good, which she learned from\nreading the region\u2019s English-language newspapers like the Gringo Gazette.\n\nRenee Varnadore buys locally, learns Spanish and engages with the people who\nlive outside their beach condo area. Photograph: Carlos Moreno/The Guardian\n\nOnce the Varnadores made up their minds, it took about two weeks for them to\nfix up their home in San Diego, and another week to get six offers on it. When\nthey had a garage sale to get rid of much of their stuff, Renee cried.\n\nBut, about six months into living by the ocean in Mexico, walking on the beach\nevery day and feeling the waves come in, something had changed inside her.\n\n\u201cI started healing, not only physically, but emotionally and spiritually,\u201d\nRenee said.\n\nOn the drive to the San Ysidro land port of entry that cuts between Tijuana\nand southern California, English-language billboards advertise beachfront\nproperties and luxury condos. \u201cOwn the dream in Baja,\u201d reads one, adorned with\nan idyllic image of a home by the ocean.\n\n\u201cStarting at 347 K,\u201d reads another, promising opulence for less in Rosarito\nBeach.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to conceive of the signs\u2019 target audience: middle-class\nAmericans, drawn to Baja for a holiday, now on their way back to the US and\ndreading it. The billboards vocalize what many of these vacationers have\nprobably been quietly imagining since they arrived: a new American dream, here\nin Mexico. Property ownership. A place to go for weekends, and maybe even to\neventually retire. Pura vida.\n\nSigns advertising beachfront properties and luxury condos in English and\nSpanish are a sign of Rosarito\u2019s changing landscape. Photograph: Carlos\nMoreno/The Guardian\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to think about it and talk about it, but doing it is a different\nstory. \u2019Cause you\u2019re actually really doing it. You\u2019re moving to another\ncountry. You\u2019re leaving a country that you were born and raised in, and you\nhave friends and family,\u201d said Chuck Contreras.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be tough. It\u2019s gonna be hard. It\u2019s gonna be scary,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cBut most things that are worth it, you know, are hard.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been much ado \u2013 now, and for the last century plus \u2013 about northbound\nmigration across the Mexico-US border. Meanwhile, traffic in the other\ndirection has flown comparatively under the radar. But it\u2019s always been there,\nin a history that often says just as much about the shortcomings of the US as\nit does about the appeal of other countries.\n\nBefore the civil war, people fled enslavement in the US to Mexico. After the\nsecond world war, American veterans moved there in search of a \u201cGI paradise\u201d.\nAnd during the cold war, political types stateside went south as a red scare\n\u201cexile\u201d to evade persecution under McCarthyism.\n\nOften, though, Americans have simply turned to their southern neighbor to live\nbetter and more cheaply while staying relatively close to the US \u2013 to get\nocean views for a fraction of the price, and still be able to visit family\nacross the border on weekends. Especially post-pandemic, as remote work has\nsurged, younger US professionals have descended on popular metros like Mexico\nCity in such droves that they\u2019ve at times clashed with locals, some of whom\nview these newcomers as gentrifiers taking advantage of Mexico\u2019s lower cost of\nliving to party away their youth.\n\nWhatever the motivations, when US citizens move to Mexico, they are crossing\nan international line, a choice that brings with it not only culture shocks,\nbut also serious legal obligations. The Varnadores and the Contrerases were\nboth careful to follow Mexico\u2019s immigration laws, but the process wasn\u2019t easy.\nJym described hoop after administrative hoop he and Renee had to jump through\nto build their lives aboveboard in Rosarito Beach \u2013 consular appointments,\nphotos, paperwork, fingerprinting. One of the toughest, or even\ninsurmountable, hurdles for many applicants are high financial requirements to\nshow \u201ceconomic solvency\u201d, demonstrated through bank statements, investment\nreports or other records.\n\nFor Americans moving to Baja because it\u2019s where they can afford a roof over\ntheir heads \u2013 who are renting apartments for $300 or less \u2013 those economic\nthresholds can be untenable. So instead, Renee said, people come in on tourist\nvisas and overstay, much like the US\u2019s own undocumented community.\n\nThen, there are Americans with the means and qualifications to immigrate\nlegally, who simply don\u2019t want to follow the process \u2013 a particular pet peeve\nfor Mary.\n\n\u201cI have a real issue with people who live here \u2013 and some of our friends who\nhave been here longer than us \u2013 who don\u2019t have permanent residency,\u201d she said.\n\u201cTo me, you know, how dare you talk to me about immigration, or any issues\nwith immigration, if you\u2019re not gonna do what the country you\u2019re in requires\nyou to do.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a voice then. You know, and don\u2019t talk about it [immigration]\nabout the United States, either.\u201d\n\nA scenic Rosarito full of tourists. Photograph: Carlos Moreno/The Guardian\n\nShe and Chuck felt strongly about doing everything the law required, from\nfollowing immigration rules to getting local car insurance and healthcare.\nThey\u2019ve also bought two \u201cmemberships\u201d at a funeral home, the ultimate\npermanent residence.\n\n\u201cWe want to make this our home,\u201d Mary said. \u201cTruly, our home. We\u2019re not\nvisiting. We\u2019re living here. And we want to be a part of the community.\u201d\n\nFor D\u00eda de los Muertos, the Mexican holiday to commemorate the dead, Jym and\nRenee install an altar at their home. They decorate it with photos of the\nloved ones they\u2019ve lost, surrounded by beautiful ephemera like marigolds and\ncandles.\n\nSome of the honorees, including Jym\u2019s mother, have been up there for a long\ntime. Others, like Renee\u2019s mom, are more recent additions.\n\nOne is their pet cat that crossed the border with them years ago, whose photo\nand ashes they place alongside a dish of water and some food. The food is gone\nby morning. Was it their other, living cats who ate it? Maybe so, but the\nVarnadores like to think otherwise.\n\n\u201cThis holiday makes sense to us,\u201d Jym said. They and the Contrerases embrace\nMexican traditions, do their best to learn Spanish, find ways to give back to\nthe local community and are acutely aware of not imposing US norms on to\nMexico.\n\nIn essence, they try.\n\nAdmittedly, Mary has learned some hard lessons after misguided steps or\nlanguage-related miscommunications during community work. Now, she has\nconversations with non-profits and the people who lead them about how to make\na positive difference alongside their Mexican neighbors.\n\nHomes, condos and Airbnb rentals occupy a part of Rosarito\u2019s privately owned\nareas where mostly foreigners live. Photograph: Carlos Moreno/The Guardian\n\n\u201cThe thing that I think we have to be sensitive to and aware of is that we\u2019re\nnot doing it at them, but with,\u201d she said. \u201cInvolving them and asking what is\nit they need and want from us, you know, rather than coming in and looking\nlike the Americans who know it all and can fix things and make it, you know,\neverything better. It does not work, and it\u2019s not appropriate or right.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Americans in Baja don\u2019t still celebrate their culture\nfrom home. They do, just like diasporic communities in the US. It just may\nlook a little different.\n\nAround Thanksgiving, the Contrerases had decked out their dining table with\ngourds, flowers and a big \u201cthankful\u201d centerpiece. Their neighbors and friends\nwere coming over for Friendsgiving \u2013 a celebration their son had started with\nthem while he was in college \u2013 and their table was laid with themed napkins\nand cups.\n\nBut instead of turkey, they\u2019d be eating Chuck\u2019s tacos. \u201cHe makes utterly\nincredible tacos,\u201d Mary gushed.\n\nThe Contrerases\u2019 home is filled with little mantras: a hanging scroll that\nreads \u201cIn a world where you can be anything, be kind!\u201d and a stone that simply\nsays \u201cgratitude\u201d, next to a rendering of the Virgen de Guadalupe.\n\nYet the words that ring most meaningful are stitched on a pillow, simple and\neven a little basic but somehow also profound: \u201cI love this place.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Mexico\n  * Housing\n  * Migration\n  * Americas\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
