That's why Hyundai is going all-out for this year's\nrace by bringing a four-car team of electric Ioniq 5 N performance crossovers.\nTheir target? The Lamborghini Urus Performante's course record for SUVs, which\nthey look to have a serious shot at beating.\n\nHyundai announced its target Wednesday, revealing its star-studded driver\nlineup for this year's Race to the Clouds. The Korean make will employ the\nexperience of 11-time Pikes Peak overall winner Paul Dallenbach, four-time\nwinner Robin Shute, three-time WRC rally winner Dani Sordo, and former Ken\nBlock affiliate Ron Zaras. Dallenbach and Zaras will captain stock examples in\nthe Production SUV class, while Shute and Sordo will race modified versions.\nThose upgraded cars (as well as the cars' liveries) will be revealed at a\nlater date.\n\n2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N. Hyundai\n\nThe stock Ioniq 5 Ns will target the course record set by Pirelli test driver\nSimone Faggioli, who took the Urus Performante up in 10:32.064 during a\nprivate non-race session in October 2022. On paper, the two SUVs are well-\nmatched: the Hyundai makes 601 horsepower (641 in launch mode) and weighs\n4,916 pounds according to Which Car?. The Urus is slightly heavier at 4,986\nlbs per Car and Driver, but it's also notably more powerful with 657 hp. And\nthat's only the beginning of its advantages.\n\nFor one, the Lamborghini has the superior power-to-weight ratio of 264 hp per\nton, while the Hyundai notches just 245. That gives it a slightly quicker\nzero-to-60 mph time of 3.1 seconds to the Hyundai's 3.25, not to mention\nbetter acceleration beyond that due to EVs' diminishing high-speed\nperformance. Those could add up along Pikes Peak's many steep inclines and\nhairpins, where the Lamborghini's four-wheel steering also aided its agility.\n(Then there's the fact that the Lamborghini got a private session, potentially\nwith favorable course conditions.)\n\nLamborghini Urus Performante at Pikes Peak in 2022. Lamborghini\n\nBut the edge isn't all Lamborghini's, as Hyundai still has plenty of tricks up\nits sleeve. The Ioniq 5 N isn't just lighter; it has better weight\ndistribution and a lower center of gravity. Its power output may be less, but\nit's electric, and therefore immune to the power-sapping effects of high\naltitude. The thin air can deprive even a turbocharged engine of a fifth its\npower at the starting line, and more near the 14,115-foot summit. EVs' instant\npower delivery also levels the playing field against the less responsive twin-\nturbo V8 of the Lamborghini. Remember, the ICE record-holding Peugeot 208 T16\nwas much more powerful than the VW ID.R that knocked it off the top.\n\nAll in all, it's a tossup, though Hyundai wouldn't call its shot if it wasn't\nconfident it could land it. And if the stock cars don't, the modified ones\nwill do the job for them\u2014weather permitting. There's no telling what the\nheavens will bring down on race day.\n\nGot a tip or question for the author?
