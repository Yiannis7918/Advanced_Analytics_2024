On one hand, AI promises unparalleled\nefficiency and limitless potential for creatives. On the other, it threatens\nto spawn a masterful new generation of cookie-cutter designs that could spell\nthe end of many creative careers. So which is true? And how do we reconcile\nthese two contradictory perspectives?\n\n1\\. John Maeda\u2019s Design in Tech Report is an annual publication that explores\nthe influence of design in the tech industry dating back to 2015. His new\nvideo series tackles design and AI.\n\n2\\. How To Speak Machine: Computational Thinking for the Rest of Us (2019) by\nJohn Maeda. The accompanying site offers a gentle introduction to AI and ML.\n\nI\u2019ve been talking about AI for a while. In my 2018 and 2019 Design in Tech\nReports,1 I talked about its growing design applications. The response\u2014if\nany\u2014was minor. Perhaps this was because AI and its capabilities were still\nfairly nascent, and the technology had a long way to go before it could truly\nreplace design jobs. Fast forward four years, and the topic is unavoidable.\nThe ChatGPT revolution is upon us. And with that, designers worldwide are\ntaking strides to \u201cspeak machine.\u201d2 They\u2019re learning how to collaborate with\nAI, training long language models with datasets and fine-tuning their outputs\nto better align with the designer\u2019s visions\u2014effectively bridging the gap\nbetween human creativity and the computational capabilities of AI. Designers\ndo so fully knowing that any magic that they create with this technology may\nthen be easily repeated, with or without them.\n\nBut, will I wake up one morning to discover that there\u2019s an AI system named\n\u201cJ0hn M43d4\u201d on Fiverr repping my work for pennies, Black Mirror-style? I\u2019m\nnot worried about it, because I know that\u2019s long been happening of my own\naccord: In the '90s, I had a certain way of creating images algorithmically\nthat was special at the time. I open-sourced the approach at MIT as a way to\nget more people to turn what few secrets I had gathered into their own magic.3\n\n3\\. I had the fortune of playing a role in the creation of MIT Scratch\n(programming for kids), Processing (programming for designers), and a few\nother non-traditional coding environments because of my early belief in coding\nas a creative practice.\n\nTAP, TYPE, WRITE (1998) in the permanent collection of MoMA and most recently\non display in \"Never Alone Video Games and Other Interactive Design\"\n(2022\u201323).ttwqwerty (1998)\n\nttwballoon (1998)\n\nBut not every magician wants to reveal their secrets\u2014they have livelihoods to\nprotect. So what should a designer in the era of AI\u2019s rapid ascent do? I have\ngood news: There are plenty of things that computers are not good at. And most\nare things designers really don\u2019t get all that much joy from doing in the\nfirst place\u2014mundane tasks like creating endless variations of slides, mockups,\nand retouches. If the computer could take on some of that work, might it give\ndesigners more time to do something else? My dear artist friend Jessie Shefrin\nonce said to me, \u201cBy the time you come to the perfect solution, the problem\nhas already changed.\u201d By that thinking, what present-day problems could\ncomputers tackle today, so we can focus on tomorrow\u2019s?\n\n> By the time you come to the perfect solution, the problem has already\n> changed.\n>\n> \u201c By the time you come to the perfect solution, the problem has already\n> changed. \u201d\n\nJessie Shefrin, artist\n\nJohn Maeda joined Andrew Hogan, Insights and Analysis at Figma, for a\ndiscussion about designing with AI in the future. Watch the recording. \ud83c\udfa5 \ud83c\udf7f\n\nTo begin, it\u2019s crucial to underline a key difference between ourselves and our\nrobot counterparts: AI, in all its glory, is designed to seek the shortest,\nmost efficient routes. This is its strength. It can evaluate thousands, even\nmillions, of potential paths in the blink of an eye and choose the most\n\u201cefficient\u201d one. Yet, as we all know, the most efficient solution is not\nalways the most creative one. In fact, I\u2019d argue that the route of greatest\nefficiency is rarely the most impactful. It might prevent us from reaching a\nmore creatively meaningful destination.\n\n4\\. \u201cIt's time to burn our ships\u201d is a phrase that means the company must cut\noff all avenues to the old ways of doing things. As leaders taking our people\ninto unknown and potentially hazardous new territories like Cort\u00e9s did, we\nneed to ensure those we lead understand there is no turning back.\n\nPart of being efficiency-oriented means that AI is constantly seeking out the\nmost common, expected path. By repeating tried and tested solutions, AI is\ninherently more risk-averse. Particularly when paired with strict guardrails\nand considerations of AI safety, it will almost always opt for the lowest\nrisk. In many cases in life, that\u2019s a really good thing. However, in the realm\nof creativity, higher risk may lead to an unexpected higher reward. When\npeople take risks and go out on a limb, they\u2019re forced to think strategically\nunder pressure, yielding unexpected results. What\u2019s that old saying? \u201cBurn the\nships!\u201d4 When there\u2019s no turning back with a high-risk decision, things get\nreally interesting quickly.\n\nHumans are innately driven to take the adventurous, longer route. Our distinct\ntraits of creativity, innovation, and uphill thinking compel us to explore the\nunseen, unheard, and untouched, even when it's seen as rationally \u201cwrong\u201d by\nconventional standards. This shared spirit, found in entrepreneurs, athletes,\nand artists alike, is demonstrated in our history of remarkable art,\ngroundbreaking discoveries, and revolutionary innovations. This willingness to\nembrace challenges, endure setbacks, and choose \u201clongcuts\u201d over shortcuts\nunderscores our unique capacity for uphill thinking. Even as AI excels at\nefficiently executing repetitive tasks, it remains rightfully constrained by\nour design for safety and lower risks, making it less suited for the daringly\nimaginative and transformative tasks that creatives undertake. This courage to\nventure in unconventional directions, to bet the farm on an irrational path,\nis what differentiates us from today\u2019s AI. The uphill thinking that may seem\nsuboptimal in an AI-centric view is, in essence, the core of human creativity.\n\nOr saying it in Star Trek parlance, to quote my favorite line between Captain\nKirk and Captain Picard:\n\n> Kirk: I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim.\n\n> Picard: You could say that.\n\n> Kirk: You know, if Spock were here, he\u2019d say that I was an irrational,\n> illogical human being by taking on a mission like that. Sounds like fun!\n\nOne may ask, can an AI truly understand the sub-optimal, winding, long, hard,\nhigh-risk, and effortful journey that humans take to yield great output? To an\nextent. It\u2019s important to remember that AI is not a sentient being. Currently,\nthere is no direct 1:1 notion of \u201cunderstanding\u201d in an AI the same way that we\nhumans understand a concept. Instead, AI can be instructed to do things with\nspecificity. Do this thing, don\u2019t do that thing. In that way, it\u2019s no\ndifferent than computer programming of the past.\n\n5\\. Vibranium is the fictional metal in Marvel\u2019s Black Panther with alien\nproperties.\n\nWhat *is* different is that this kind of programming feels a bit like being\npowered by Vibranium.5 It\u2019s a momentous shift, one that has supercharged our\ntechnology to a point nearly beyond comprehension. We\u2019ve had similar shifts in\nthe past: There was a time when electricity was the day\u2019s Vibranium. In a\nworld powered by steam engines, the introduction of technology that was\ncompletely invisible caused immense excitement and fear. Steam power posed a\nfrightening disruption for the textile industry, as new mills could easily\nfabricate textiles that would have taken humans months and years to create.\n\n6\\. The Arts and Crafts movement was an international trend in the decorative\nand fine arts that developed earliest and most fully in the British Isles\nduring the 1860s and \u201870s and subsequently spread across the British Empire\nand to the rest of Europe and America.\n\n7\\. The Luddites were members of a 19th-century movement of English textile\nworkers which opposed the use of certain types of cost-saving machinery, often\nby destroying the machines in clandestine raids. They protested against\nmanufacturers who used machines in \u201ca fraudulent and deceitful manner\u201d to\nreplace the skilled labor of workers and drive down wages by producing\ninferior goods.\n\nIn response to this industrial revolution, artisans and leaders founded a\nrevolution of their own in the form of the Arts & Crafts movement,6 which\nadvocated for \u201cproducts that not only had more integrity but which were also\nmade in a less dehumanizing way.\u201d Some of their fiercest supporters, self-\nproclaimed Luddites,7 would engage in engage in \u201cframe breaking\u201d (i.e.\ndestroying an automated weaving machine), often getting jailed and fined as a\nresult. But what\u2019s important about the Arts & Crafts movement is how it led to\nan enlightenment of objects that could only be created by human beings:\ntextiles, furniture, and other items that were so intricately created that no\nmachine could possibly manufacture them.\n\nThis image shows the artist's interpretation of the Luddites breaking a loom.\nThe famous poet Lord Byron opposed the Frame Breaking Act of 1812 that would\nmake machine breaking a capital crime, going so far as to defend the frame-\nbreakers with a Taylor Swiftian song. (Wikimedia)\n\nTwo designs by William Morris, textile designer, poet, artist, fantasy writer,\nand Arts and Crafts activist: Snakeshead printed textile (1876)and \"Peacock\nand Dragon\" woven wool furnishing fabric (1878)\n\nThis reverence for human creativity was also reflected in the educational\ninstitutions founded during this time, such as the Rhode Island School of\nDesign (RISD).8 They pioneered the use of the first wave of \u201cgenerative art\nsoftware\u201d in the form of punch cards9 for Jacquard looms\u2014the GPUs of the\nday\u2014and designed distinctive textile patterns that married artistry with new\ntechnology.\n\n8\\. The Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) was founded to support the\nstate\u2019s thriving textiles and jewelry industries in particular, with the first\ncourses of study offered addressing two main areas: Freehand Drawing and\nPainting and Mechanical Drawing and Design.\n\n9\\. Each row of punched holes in these cards corresponds to a row of the\ntextile being woven. (National Museums Scotland)\n\nFast-forward to today, and RISD continues to champion the ethos of the Arts &\nCrafts movement, serving as a bastion of uphill thinking in our modern digital\nage. At RISD, students are taught to embrace the complexity of the design\nprocess, to not shy away from the long, winding road of creative discovery.\nThis attitude prepares them to venture beyond the efficiency-driven solutions\noffered by AI and to craft designs with a level of nuance and authenticity\nthat only human touch can achieve. The spirit of RISD is a testament to the\nenduring value of human creativity, reminding us that while AI has its\nstrengths, there will always be a space carved out for uniquely human\nendeavors.\n\nSo where does AI fit into all this? In the same spaces where efficiency and\nprecision thrive. AI\u2019s proficiency in automation, data analysis, and pattern\nrecognition can streamline mundane tasks, freeing up more time for us to focus\non the aspects that demand human ingenuity. We\u2019ve entered the same age as\nRuskin and Morris, when we need to create things, software, experiences that\nonly we humans can guide in their evolution. By leveraging AI, we can not only\nretire our drudgery, but we also amplify our uphill thinking, taking on\ngreater challenges and achieving unprecedented heights.\n\n> By leveraging AI, we can not only retire our drudgery work but we can now\n> also amplify our uphill thinking, taking on greater challenges and achieving\n> unprecedented heights.\n>\n> \u201c By leveraging AI, we can not only retire our drudgery work but we can now\n> also amplify our uphill thinking, taking on greater challenges and achieving\n> unprecedented heights. \u201d\n\nNoah Levin echoes this ethos in his recent post, and hypothesizes about AI\u2019s\npotential to open up design to an even greater contribution: \u201cAI will lift\nthis ceiling, leading to more creative outputs made possible by more powerful\ntools; it will also lower the floor, making it easier for anyone to design and\nvisually collaborate.\u201d The problems we solve today in design have already\nchanged by the time they\u2019ve been addressed. Thus we need to be investing more\ntime and energy into the ever-changing task of seeking and identifying new\nproblems to solve, ones that lead to better outcomes for people. Part of that\nis continuing to find better ways to work well together, until we\u2019re all\nworking as teams of eminently capable professionals who can finish each\nothers\u2019 sentences.\n\nThe more we pedal uphill\u2014navigating the journey, embracing the struggle, and\nrejoicing in the climb\u2014with AI empowering us to spend more time on that\njourney, it\u2019s more of a win-win relationship we will build with AI in the\ncreative fields. It gives us more time to take in the scenery and identify\nopportunities for exploration that may lie just off the beaten path. It frees\nus to focus on the things that only humans can do: spend a little bit more\ntime than is strictly necessary, in order to end up somewhere unexpected.\n\nJohn Maeda joined Andrew Hogan, Insights and Analysis at Figma, for a\ndiscussion about designing with AI in the future.
