These caverns, which are expected to be complete next year, will\nbe able to store hydrogen gas.\n\nThe hydrogen will be produced nearby through a process called electrolysis.\nThis will be done using excess solar and wind power in spring and fall, when\ndemand for energy is low. Then it can be stored until peak energy demand hits\nin the summer \u2014 at that time, it would be burned at a power plant as a blend\nof hydrogen and natural gas.\n\nThe burning of hydrogen does not release planet-warming pollution, but it's\nunclear just how eco-friendly the new plant will be. The amount of pollution\nproduced will depend on the hydrogen/natural gas ratio used.\n\nNonetheless, the new facility will help clean up the air for local residents\nas it replaces a coal plant. Exposure to pollution from the burning of coal\ncontributes to respiratory illnesses, neurological and developmental damage,\nand lung disease, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nInvestments in clean energy sources, such as hydrogen produced with renewable\nenergy, are also crucial to slow down the overheating of our planet. While the\nburning of hydrogen releases no planet-warming pollution, coal, oil, and gas\nare the biggest contributors, accounting for over 75% of global planet-warming\npollution and nearly 90% of all carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere,\nper the United Nations.\n\nGood news, green hacks, and the latest cool clean tech \u2014 straight to your\ninbox every week!\n\n#### Watch now: Alex Honnold test drives his new Rivian\n\nAlex Honnold test drives his new Rivian\n\n0 seconds of 42 secondsVolume 0%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nCopied\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n00:42\n\n00:42\n\nIf burning coal or gas fuels it, hydrogen production can create pollution.\nHowever, the fuel becomes a clean storage resource, or \"green hydrogen,\" when\nsolar or wind energy powers its production, as will happen in Utah.\n\nGreen hydrogen as an alternative power source is gaining traction in the\nUnited States. For instance, a Texas factory is planning on producing green\nhydrogen that uses wind and sun as energy sources for the electrolysis\nprocess. It will be the largest facility of its kind in the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, the Biden administration recently announced $7 billion in funding\nfor hydrogen projects across the country to jump-start production.\n\nWhile the Utah project looks promising, it still has its challenges. Ilissa\nOcko, a scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, told the New York Times\nthat getting to 100% hydrogen in the next 20 years would very likely require\nmajor facility upgrades or complete rebuilding.\n\n\"The costs can very easily add up when you make the adjustments that you need\nto the infrastructure,\" she told the publication. \"There are so many\ncomplicating factors here that can make it very easily turn into something\nthat is not beneficial to the climate.\"\n\nStill, \"It's a massive amount of storage,\" Jigar Shah, head of the Department\nof Energy's loan program office, told The Times, noting that the plant will\ncomplement other renewable energy projects in the West that together can\nproduce surplus electricity in the spring and fall. \"This is a great way to\ndeal with all that excess supply.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations\nimproving our lives and saving our planet.\n\n  * share\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Link Copied!\n\n## Cool Picks\n\n#### Here are 5 innovative design ideas that can protect homes during the most\nextreme weather disasters\n\n#### This startup helps you save money on your utility bills by switching to\nsolar power \u2014 no rooftop panels necessary\n\n#### Here's a simple way to turn your old sneakers into actual cash: 'I can\ntell you firsthand \u2014 it works'\n\n#### This new law is like a free '$8,000 bank account' for remodeling your\nhome \u2014 here's how to take advantage of it\n\n  * ABOUT\n  * PRIVACY\n  * TERMS\n  * CONTACT\n\n#### Follow Us\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n\n\u00a9 2024 THE COOL DOWN COMPANY.
