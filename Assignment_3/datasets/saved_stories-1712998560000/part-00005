UConn\u2019s crushing superiority stays the same\n\nTransfer portals, NIL deals and the lure of the NBA make sustained success\ndifficult. But the Huskies are building a mini-dynasty under Dan Hurley\n\nAlex Kirshner\n\nShare\n\nThe University of Connecticut already had a men\u2019s basketball dynasty. How else\nto describe a program that had won five national titles since 1999, with those\nvictories coming under three different head coaches? If dynasties are\nhereditary, the Huskies passed theirs from Jim Calhoun to Kevin Ollie to their\ncurrent boss, Dan Hurley. All that happened on Monday night was a set of\naffirmations \u2013 that Hurley has built something even better than Connecticut\nhad before. And that, for now, the only other team that compares is Dawn\nStaley\u2019s unbeaten South Carolina in the women\u2019s game.\n\nA 75-60 win over Purdue in the national championship game was a master class\nin every sense. The Boilermakers had a player who has been the best in men\u2019s\ncollege basketball for two years: the running, hulking center Zach Edey.\nHurley\u2019s team had a plan, which revealed itself as the night went on: UConn\nwould take their chances and let Edey bang away near the basket, but they\nwould otherwise cut Purdue\u2019s strengths out from under them. The Boilermakers\nwere one of the country\u2019s best three-point-shooting teams all season, making\nmore than 40% of their shots from beyond the arc. On Monday, they went 1-for-7\nfrom that range. Edey\u2019s 37 points didn\u2019t matter when the other Purdue players\nhad 23 combined. UConn\u2019s scoring attack, on the other hand, came in waves, a\nperfect testament to the depth Hurley has built at his outpost in Storrs,\nConnecticut.\n\nNCAA Tournament: UConn crush Purdue to retain men\u2019s national title\n\nRead more\n\nHurley is flatly the best coach in men\u2019s college basketball right now. His\nprofession is at a generational crossroads, as several legends of the game\nhave retired over the past few years, or will soon. (So long, Mike Krzyzewski,\nJim Boeheim, Roy Williams, and Jay Wright.) Not exactly young at 51 but with\nlots of career left if he wants it, Hurley has established himself as the\nleader of a new generation of college coaches. He has done that by winning:\nTwo national titles in a row put him in rare air, and all 12 opponents in the\npast two NCAA tournaments lost to him by at least 13 points. \u201cWhat could you\nsay? We won. By a lot, again,\u201d Hurley told reporters afterward. Indeed they\ndid.\n\nBut Hurley\u2019s Connecticut stand out for their manner of victory as much as the\nextent of it. He has staged his ascent at a moment of change in college\nsports. Players can now collect money from third parties, and the combination\nof those payments and recently loosened transfer rules mean that roster\nmanagement is nothing like what it was in the days of Hurleys\u2019 retired peers.\nAt the same time, programs that rely too heavily on the recruitment of high\nschool superstars have fallen short in tournament after tournament. Kentucky\u2019s\nJohn Calipari, the poster boy for that method, looks to be bolting.\n\nIn that chaotic environment, UConn are a picture of stability. The Huskies do\nrecruit NBA talent. Several players from last year\u2019s champs have joined the\nleague, and more are coming. (Guard Stephon Castle and center Donovan Clingan\nare about to become wealthy young men.) But the Huskies are not a magnet for\nlegions of star recruits who leave college after one season, even if Castle\nsoon does. At the same time, Hurley has worked the transfer portal effectively\nwithout blocking the growth of too many players on his own roster. Tristen\nNewton, the guard who led this team in scoring, played three years at East\nCarolina before joining up at UConn and playing a vital role on back-to-back\ntitle teams.\n\nNone of this is all that splashy, and it\u2019s why a program that has two titles\nin two years and six in 26 will never have the same mainstream cachet of Duke\nor Kentucky. Those programs are eternal stopovers for future top NBA picks,\nand they hold a cultural perch that will remain elusive to everyone else. The\ngenius of Connecticut is that the Huskies don\u2019t care about those style points,\nnor have they let a lack of them prevent the program from lapping the likes of\nDuke and Kentucky in recent championships. (Since the turn of the century, the\ncount of championships is UConn five, Duke and Kentucky a combined four.)\n\nUConn have done their business over a long enough timespan that there is not\nmuch reason to expect it to abate soon. The Huskies have had a few messy down\nyears, but their success has been stunningly durable given the transformations\nthat have occurred around them. They have not only won it all under three\ncoaches but in what amounts to three different conferences. They won their\nfirst three men\u2019s titles in the old edition of the Big East, which had a\nhandful of Eastern religious colleges and a mix of secular schools that have\nsince made football-driven moves to other leagues. UConn did too, for a\nmoment, and won another title in the American Athletic. They returned home to\na reconstituted Big East after realizing that the move made no sense. Two more\ntitles have flowed forth.\n\nAll of which is to say: Nobody knows how long Hurley will be at UConn. Nobody\nknows how the team\u2019s roster may change from year to year. But everyone knows\nthe Huskies have become one of a kind. And after Monday, even fewer could\nprotest that they have crafted a multi-generational dynasty.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * NCAA Tournament 2024\n  * NCAA Tournament\n  * College basketball\n  * Basketball\n  * College sports\n  * US sports\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Football\n  * Cricket\n  * Rugby union\n  * Tennis\n  * Cycling\n  * F1\n  * Golf\n  * US sports\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
