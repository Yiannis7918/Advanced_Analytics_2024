There may be confounding variables\ninvolved, where C causes A and C also causes B. Maybe it only affects some\npeople. Maybe the effects are just coincidence. Maybe it's several things that\nhave to happen together. I think people want to have a villain to blame,\nwhether it's salt or sugar or fat or carbs or meat or sitting down or\npesticides or seed oils or food processing or video games or nitrates or\nbutter. But biology is a lot more complicated than that.\n\nWe want simple answers, and favor studies that match our existing beliefs. Be\nskeptical! In moderation, of course.\n\nLabels: health\n\n\u2013 Amit \u2013 Friday, April 12, 2024\n\n#### 0 comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\nOlder Post Home\n\nSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Amit Patel\n\nDiese Website verwendet Cookies von Google, um Dienste anzubieten und Zugriffe\nzu analysieren.
