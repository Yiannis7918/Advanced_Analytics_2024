Qualcomm will become part of\nCanonical's silicon partner program, which can lead to optimized flavors of\nUbuntu tailored for their platforms.\n\nIn today's announcement they talk up this strategic collaboration as speeding\nup time to market, security-first focus, and more.\n\nParticularly with the Ubuntu Core focus there is a big focus on Qualcomm\nembedded devices but hopefully this will lead to Ubuntu Linux improvements for\nQualcomm-powered laptops. Particularly with the forthcoming Snapdragon X Elite\nlaptop processor, hopefully we'll be seeing timely support for Ubuntu Linux on\nthese new ARM laptops that are rumored to compete with and potentially\noutperform Apple Silicon devices. Snapdragon X ELite with 12 Oryon cores\nclocking up to 3.8GHz (4.3GHz boost), Adreno graphics, Hegagon NPU, and other\nupdates this is quite an interesting ARM laptop processor to look forward to\nthis year. Qualcomm has shown (Debian) Linux on some Snapdragon X Elite\nhardware already and hopefully today's collaboration between Qualcomm and\nCanonical will lead to good Ubuntu support for these upcoming laptops.\n\n16 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nUbuntu 24.04 Beta Now Available For Testing\n\nCanonical Announces Ubuntu Pro For Devices\n\nNetplan 1.0 Is Ready To Go For Ubuntu 24.04 LTS\n\nUbuntu 24.04 Beta Delayed Due To XZ Nightmare\n\nCanonical Continues Exploring Ubuntu x86-64-v3 Images - Now In Microsoft's\nCloud\n\nCanonical Extends Ubuntu LTS Support To 12 Years For Ubuntu Pro Customers\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
