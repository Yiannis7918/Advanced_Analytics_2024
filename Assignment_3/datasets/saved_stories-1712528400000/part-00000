The observatory is a popular tourist attraction in the capital city.\n\nThe sphere moves back and forth during earthquakes or typhoons that regularly\nlash the island, absorbing the force of any \u201cviolent swinging,\u201d according to\nthe Taipei 101 website. The damper\u2019s engineers say it can curtail the\nbuilding\u2019s movement by up to 40 percent, reducing the queasiness felt by its\noccupants.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nClosed-circuit TV footage of the Taipei skyline at the moment the earthquake\nhit shows the pagoda-shaped skyscraper hardly moving.

(Video: Reuters)\n\nTaipei 101 was the world\u2019s tallest building when it was completed in 2004 \u2014 a\ntitle it held until 2009. As the name suggests, it is 101 stories tall,\nreaching a height of 1,667 feet, including its spire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has a number of other design features that increase its resilience to\nnatural disasters \u2014 including 380 piles driven deep into the ground. The\ndeepest is rammed some 30 meters, or almost 100 feet, into the bedrock, which,\naccording to Taipei 101, \u201cis similar to nailing the entire building onto a\nsolid tectonic plate.\u201d Power is supplied to the building via two substations,\nreducing the risk of an outage.\n\nTaiwan, home to 23 million people, is vulnerable to earthquakes because of its\nlocation within the world\u2019s most seismically active zone, known as the Ring of\nFire. Nine people were killed and more than 900 injured in Wednesday\u2019s\nearthquake, the strongest to strike the island in 25 years. A 7.6-magnitude\ntremor struck central Taiwan in 1999, killing more than 2,400 people.\n\nTaipei 101 is not the only skyscraper in Taiwan and around the world to use\ndamper systems for stability \u2014 although it is a rare case in which the\nengineering is on display.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nA design flaw could have doomed a New York skyscraper in the 1970s \u2014 even\nthough it had a tuned mass damper, an advanced design feature at the time. The\nbuilding\u2019s engineer had to hustle to resolve the issue \u2014 which was pointed out\nby a college student \u2014 as the hurricane season was approaching.\n\nA video on Taipei 101\u2019s website shows the sphere rocking gently during a\ncyclone in 2015, ranked by scientists as one of the strongest storms in the\nworld that year.\n\n  * How a steel ball protected Taiwan\u2019s tallest skyscraper in an earthquake\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\nHow a steel ball protected Taiwan\u2019s tallest skyscraper in an earthquake\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\n  * Huge Taiwan quake caused few deaths thanks to preparedness \u2014 and luck\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\nHuge Taiwan quake caused few deaths thanks to preparedness \u2014 and luck\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\n  * In photos and videos: Taiwan hit with strongest earthquake in 25 years\n\nApril 3, 2024\n\nIn photos and videos: Taiwan hit with strongest earthquake in 25 years\n\nApril 3, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nWorld news\n\nEssential reporting from around the world\n\nAl-Shifa hospital an \u2018empty shell,\u2019 WHO says as Biden pushes for Gaza deal\n\nMexico breaks relations with Ecuador after embassy raid\n\nWhy Israel may reopen a key crossing with Gaza\n\nback\n\nTry a different topic\n\nSign in or create a free account to save your preferences\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompany\n\n* About The Post\n* Newsroom Policies & Standards\n* Diversity & Inclusion\n* Careers\n* Media & Community Relations\n* WP Creative Group\n* Accessibility Statement\n* Sitemap\n\nGet The Post\n\n* Become a Subscriber\n* Gift Subscriptions\n* Mobile & Apps\n* Newsletters & Alerts\n* Washington Post Live\n* Reprints & Permissions\n* Post Store\n* Books & E-Books\n* Print Archives (Subscribers Only)\n* Today\u2019s Paper\n* Public Notices\n* Coupons\n\nContact Us\n\n* Contact the Newsroom\n* Contact Customer Care\n* Contact the Opinions Team\n* Advertise\n* Licensing & Syndication\n* Request a Correction\n* Send a News Tip\n* Report a Vulnerability\n\nTerms of Use\n\n* Digital Products Terms of Sale\n* Print Products Terms of Sale\n* Terms of Service\n* Privacy Policy\n* Cookie Settings\n* Submissions & Discussion Policy\n* RSS Terms of Service\n* Ad Choices\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n  * About The Post\n  * Contact the Newsroom\n  * Contact Customer Care\n  * Request a Correction\n  * Send a News Tip\n  * Report a Vulnerability\n  * Download the Washington Post App\n  * Policies & Standards\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Settings\n  * Print Products Terms of Sale\n  * Digital Products Terms of Sale\n  * Submissions & Discussion Policy\n  * RSS Terms of Service\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Coupons\n\n", "frontpage": true}
