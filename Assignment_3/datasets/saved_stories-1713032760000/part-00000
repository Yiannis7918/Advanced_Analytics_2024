What is broken or inaccessible?\n\n\u2022 Scope: How many users are affected?\n\n\u2022 Impact: How urgent is the issue?\n\n\u2022 Which teams should be notified?\n\n\u2022 If you have screenshots or other files that illustrate the problem, please\nupload them.\n\nWhen a user submits this form, the information is posted in the channel, and\nwe also notify the specified teams.\n\nThe workflow also displays a \"Claim for review\" button, which the relevant\nengineering team can click to indicate that the report is being triaged or\ninvestigated.\n\nMuch of the conversation around the issue then takes place in a dedicated\nthread, and when the issue is resolved, an engineer will click another button,\n\"Resolve the issue,\" at which point all data related to the workflow gets\npopulated in a spreadsheet, which we can use to track incident response\nmetrics, such as Time to Acknowledgement and Time to Resolution.\n\n### Locking it down\n\nThe introduction of the Slack workflow achieved some immediate benefits. It\nbrought structure to the bug reports, it helped us quickly route the reports\nto the relevant teams, and it gave us valuable data that we could use to\nassess and improve our response times.\n\nHowever, getting members of the channel to use the workflow consistently was\nmore difficult than I anticipated. Many users of the channel only visited it\noccasionally (when they had a problem to report) and were missing the regular\nreminders about the \"right\" way to post in the channel.\n\nAfter multiple months of having to gently remind users to follow the\nprescribed process, I decided to take a different approach and not give them\nthe option to do otherwise.\n\nI persuaded our Slack admins to adjust the posting permissions so that no\nhumans could post in the channel.\n\nInstead, posting permissions were granted only to two Slack workflows: the\n\"Report a Bug\" form, which is the primary way users can interact with the\nchannel, and a general \"Announcements\" form, which can be used to post any\nother information relevant to the channel that's not a bug report.\n\nHuman users can still reply in threads, but the ability to post a free-form,\ntop-level post was removed.\n\n### Fully tamed\n\nThe end result was a Slack channel with structure and organization. The\norderly flow of information, starting from a well defined form, continuing\ninto the channel itself, and eventually into a format where we could track and\nanalyze the data, was a drastic improvement over where we began.\n\nAnd, as expected, it has led to faster incident response and higher\nsatisfaction among our stakeholders.\n\nIndeed, this effort has been so successful that we're looking to transform\nother support channels to use similar restrictions and workflows.\n\nWill this ChatOps approach to incident management scale indefinitely? Maybe\nnot. But for now, we've put in place a solution that's a good fit for our\ncurrent company size and processes, with plenty of room to scale upward before\nwe need to explore other options.\n\n## About Shaun\n\nShaun Gallagher is the author of three popular science books and one silly\nstatistics book:\n\nHe's also a software engineering manager and lives in northern Delaware with\nhis wife and children.\n\nVisit his portfolio site for more about his books and his programming\nprojects.\n\nThe views expressed on this blog are his own and do not necessarily represent\nthe views of his publishers or employer.\n\n## Recent posts\n\n### This online experiment identifies dogmatic thinking\n\nAdapted from a 2020 study, this web experiment tests a cognitive quirk that\ncontributes to dogmatic worldviews.\n\nRead more\n\n### Distributism: A Kids' Guide to a Third-Way Economic System\n\nThis student guide explores three economic systems (capitalism, socialism, and\ndistributism) and explains how distributism is different from the other two.\n\nRead more\n\n### You can thrive in a high-paying career without being money-driven\n\nWhat if making money is not one of your top goals?
