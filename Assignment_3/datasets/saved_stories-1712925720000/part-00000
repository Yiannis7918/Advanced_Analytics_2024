Here we use\nsoundscape measurements in Hawaii to demonstrate that multiple coral reef\ncommunities are rapidly responsive to shifts in nighttime ambient light, with\nsustained changes in biological sound between moonrise and moonset. High\nfrequency pulse train sounds from fish (0.5-1.5 kHz) are found to increase\nduring moonlight hours, while low frequency fish vocalizations (0.1-0.3 kHz)\nand invertebrate sounds (2-20 kHz) are found to decrease during moonlight\nhours. These discoveries suggest that the rising and setting of the moon\ntriggers regular shifts in coral reef ecosystem interactions. Future acoustic\nmonitoring of reef health may be improved by comparing soundscapes during\nmoonlight and non-moonlight hours, which may provide early indicators of\nshifts in the relative abundance of separate reef communities.\n\n## Figures\n\nCitation: Duane D, Freeman S, Freeman L (2024) Moonlight-driven biological\nchoruses in Hawaiian coral reefs.

Effective conservation efforts\nrequire long-term monitoring of reef ecosystems, however conventional diver\nsurveys may significantly undersample the environment and cannot be conducted\nat night when reef communities are most active [2, 3].\n\nAcoustic monitoring is a reliable and noninvasive method of observing coral\nreef ecosystems, with increased noise from fish and invertebrates associated\nwith healthier reefs [2, 4\u20136]. A single acoustic sensor in a reef may record\nhundreds of fish sounds and thousands of invertebrate sounds per minute,\nproviding an aggregated measurement of biological activity which may allow for\nthe early detection of changes in population abundance and behavior [7, 8].\nCoral reef soundscapes also act as a beacon for recruiting pelagic fish and\ncrustacean larva [9\u201311], and recent restoration efforts have been aided by\nartificial playback of healthy reef sounds to promote recruitment [12]. Given\nthe potential for acoustic monitoring and playback to facilitate reef\nrestoration efforts, it is important to understand how the interactions of\nseparate reef communities contribute to changes in underwater soundscapes.\n\nHere we use long-term acoustic measurements of coral reef soundscapes in\nHawaii to demonstrate the rapid response of multiple reef communities to\nchanges in nighttime ambient light after moonrise and moonset, in addition to\npreviously-known biological responses to daylight [4, 13, 14]. High frequency\npulse train sounds from fish (0.5\u20131.5 kHz) are found to increase during\nmoonlight hours, while low frequency fish vocalizations (0.1\u20130.3 kHz) and\ninvertebrate sounds (2\u201320 kHz) are found to decrease during moonlight hours.\nThe observed changes in biological sound between moonrise and moonset are\nlikely a response to changing lunar light levels rather than tidal variations,\nsince high tide and low tide are not synchronized with the rising and setting\nof the moon in the environment studied (S1 Fig).\n\n## Methods\n\nHydrophones were mounted on the seafloor in three coral reef environments off\nthe west coast of Hawaii Island (Fig 1). Survey Site 1 is off the coast of\nKawaihae Harbor, south of Hapuna Beach State Park, where the bottom is covered\nwith spur and groove coral fingers alternating with sand channels. The sand is\nat about 30 m depth and the coral ridges rise up to about 15 m depth at the\ntop. The sensor was placed in a sand channel at 21.9 m depth between two coral\nridges. Survey Sites 2 and 3 are near a long reef slope ending in a sandy\nbottom at 20\u201335 m depth. The sensor at Site 2 is closer to the reef at 21.9 m\ndepth, and the sensor at Site 3 is in deeper water along the sand slope at\n33.2 m depth. Deployments lasted from 3/17/2020 to 5/15/2021 for Survey Site\n1, 4/21/2020 to 9/6/2021 for Survey Site 2, and 4/21/2020 to 8/23/2021 for\nSurvey Site 3. The sensor at Site 1 was replaced on 9/24/2020. A Loggerhead\nLS1 recorder was deployed at Site 1, and Loggerhead LS1X recorders were\ndeployed at Sites 2 and 3.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 1. Survey locations.\n\nBathymetric maps showing geographic coordinates of survey locations in Hawaii\n[15]. The white box in A denotes the region shown in B. Labeled white dots in\nB denote the location of the three survey sites.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299916.g001\n\nHydrophones were set to record at a sampling rate of 96 kHz, recording for 1\nminute every 15 minutes in Survey Site 1, and 1 minute every 10 minutes in\nSurvey Sites 2 and 3. These duty cycles are significantly shorter than the\ntimescales of the environmental changes studied here. The sensitivity of the\nHTI96-min hydrophones used here was -170 dB re V/\u03bcPa, and the frequency range\nwas 2 Hz to 30 kHz. Spectrograms of each one-minute recording were generated\nusing fast-fourier transforms of 70% overlapping segments with 2048 samples\nwindowed with a hann function.\n\nContributions to the soundscape from separate marine communities are isolated\nby selecting acoustic frequency bands typically dominated by specific\nbiological sounds. Vocalizations from Hawaiian coral reef fish primarily\noccupy frequencies between 0.1\u20130.3 kHz [16], high frequency pulse train sounds\noccupy frequencies between 0.5\u20131.5 kHz [16], and broadband clicks from\nsnapping shrimp and other invertebrates occupy frequencies between 2\u201320 kHz\n[17, 18].\n\nThe mean change in power spectral density due to the response of marine life\nto moonlight \u3008\u0394PSD\u3009 is measured across each month surveyed according to: (1)\nwhere S_moon,i and S_no moon,i are the power spectral density in linear scale\nduring nighttime moonlight and nighttime non-moonlight hours respectively,\naveraged in time across the ith one-minute sample and in frequency across the\nrelevant band. Samples where the averaged power spectral density is in the top\n2 percentile for each month are discarded in order to minimize the\ncontribution of loud non-biological sounds such as ship-radiated noises.\nMoonlight hours are defined here as times between 1.5 hours after moonrise and\n1.5 hours before moonset, and non-moonlight hours are defined as times between\n1.5 hours after moonset and 1.5 hours before moonrise. Nighttime hours are\ndefined here as times between 4 hours after sunset and 2 hours before sunrise,\nin order to avoid contributions from dusk and dawn choruses of fish and\ninvertebrates. n_moon and n_no moon are respectively defined as the number of\none-minute samples available during nighttime moonlight hours and nighttime\nnon-moonlight hours in the month surveyed.\n\nThe standard deviation of the power spectral density during moonlight hours is\ncalculated according to: (2) where (3) and (4) The standard deviation of the\npower spectral density during non-moonlight hours is similarly calculated\naccording to: (5) where (6) and (7)\n\nThe standard deviation of the change in power spectral density due to the\nresponse of marine life to moonlight \u03c3_\u0394PSD is then defined as the pooled\nstandard deviation of \u03c3_moon and \u03c3_no moon: (8) Statistical significance is\nevaluated for each full month surveyed and for each frequency band by\ncomparing the mean change in power spectral density during moonlight hours\n\u3008\u0394PSD\u3009 to the standard deviation \u03c3_\u0394PSD. If \u3008\u0394PSD\u3009 > \u03c3_\u0394PSD, the change in\npower spectral density due to the response of marine life to moonlight is\nconsidered statistically significant for the month surveyed. If \u3008\u0394PSD\u3009 <\n\u03c3_\u0394PSD, the difference is not considered statistically significant.\n\nMeasurements of \u3008\u0394PSD\u3009 and \u03c3_\u0394PSD are shown in S1 Table for the 0.5\u20131.5 kHz\nband associated with high frequency pulse trains from fish, S2 Table for the\n0.1\u20130.3 kHz band associated with low-frequency fish vocalizations, and S3\nTable for the 2\u201320 kHz band associated with invertebrate sounds. n_moon and\nn_no moon values are shown in S4 Table. Measurements of \u3008\u0394PSD\u3009 are not made in\nthe 0.1\u20130.3 kHz and 0.5\u20131.5 kHz frequency bands between December and March,\nsince humpback whale vocalizations dominate the underwater soundscape for the\nmajority of these months. Measurements of \u3008\u0394PSD\u3009 are also not made in the\n0.1\u20130.3 kHz and 0.5\u20131.5 kHz frequency bands after June 2021 in Site 2 or May\n2021 in Site 3 since low-frequency (<2 kHz) electrical noise contaminated the\nsignal during these months.\n\n## Results\n\nCoral reef fish such as pomacentrids, mullids, and chaetodontids produce high\nfrequency pulses and pulse train sounds in the 0.5\u20131.5 kHz band [16]. In all\nthree survey sites studied, there are significant increases in power spectral\ndensity during moonlight hours in this band. The response of high frequency\npulse trains to moonlight was strongest in Survey Site 1 (Fig 2), where a\nstatistically significant increase in power spectral density is observed\nduring moonlight hours for every month surveyed (Fig 3, S1 Table), with \u3008\u0394PSD\u3009\nvalues ranging from 3.28 to 5.71 dB. Statistically significant \u3008\u0394PSD\u3009 values\nwere also observed in 4 out of the 9 surveyed months in Site 2, and 6 out of\nthe 8 surveyed months in Site 3.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 2.

Increases in PSD at 0.5\u20131.5 kHz\nduring moonlight hours (B,D,F) are caused by high frequency pulse trains from\nfish. Decreases in PSD at 2\u201320 kHz during moonlight hours (D,F) are caused by\nreductions in invertebrate sounds. The decrease in PSD during moonlight hours\nat 0.1\u20130.3 kHz (D) is caused by reductions in fish vocalizations. Shaded\nregions in each subplot designate standard deviation.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299916.g008\n\n## Discussion\n\nBiological activity in coral reefs is found to be responsive to changes in\nnighttime ambient light, with sustained changes in biological sound between\nmoonrise and moonset observed for multiple communities in Hawaiian reefs. High\nfrequency pulse trains were found to be responsive to moonlight in all three\nsurvey sites studied, with increases in power spectral density of up to 5.7\ndB. Low frequency fish vocalizations were found to be responsive to moonlight\nin one of the survey sites, with decreases of up to 4.4 dB during moonlight\nhours. Invertebrate sounds were also found to change with moonlight in two of\nthe sites surveyed, with decreases of up to 0.8 dB. These discoveries suggest\nthat changes in moonlight may trigger nightly shifts in ecosystem interactions\nin Hawaiian coral reefs.\n\nWhile previous studies have investigated variations in coral reef sound with\nrespect to monthly cycles in lunar phase [19, 25\u201328], we show here that reef\nactivity is responsive to the daily rising and setting of the moon. It is\npossible that these daily lunar cycles give rise to the reported monthly\ntrends in biological sound, since lunar phase is correlated to the percentage\nof nighttime hours where the moon is above the horizon. For example, the new\nmoon rises close to sunrise and sets close to sunset, so the new moon is\nalmost never above the horizon during nighttime hours. Previous studies\nshowing increases in coral reef fish vocalizations [26\u201328] and invertebrate\nsounds [19] during the new moon are therefore consistent with our findings\nshowing increases in these biological sounds during non-moonlight hours. By\ninvestigating variations in biological sound over shorter timescales on the\norder of minutes, we demonstrate that coral reef communities are rapidly\nresponsive to shifts in nighttime ambient light.\n\nSince monthly lunar trends in biological activity have been identified in a\nvariety of coral reef environments, including the Florida Keys [27], the U.S.\nVirgin Islands [19], the Great Barrier Reef [26], and Maui, Hawaii [28], it is\nlikely that the daily lunar cycles shown here would be similarly present\nacross many reef environments. Understanding these shifts in coral reef\nsoundscapes may be important for ecosystem monitoring and restoration. Changes\nin the relative abundance of separate reef communities may be detectable by\ncomparing biological soundscapes during moonlight hours and non-moonlight\nhours. Strategic use of known soundscape variations may also improve efforts\nto recruit fish and crustacean larva to reefs using artificial playback of\nhealthy soundscapes. Given the significant increase in biological sounds\nbetween moonrise and moonset, the response of larva to artificial soundscapes\nmay be affected by whether soundscape recordings were made during moonlight\nhours.\n\n## Supporting information\n\nMean change in power spectral density due to the response of marine life to\nmoonlight \u3008\u0394PSD\u3009 in the band associated with high frequency pulse trains from\nfish (0.5-1.5 kHz).\n\nShowing 1/6: pone.0299916.s001.pdf\n\n### S1 Table.

The timing of high and low tide in both locations are\nnot consistently in sync with moonrise (white dots) or moonset (black dots)\n[29]. Tidal cycles in Hawaii are mixed-semidiurnal, meaning there are two high\ntides and two low tides of different sizes every lunar day. Black bars\ncorrespond to the time between moonset and moonrise. Coordinates of the NOAA\nbuoy in Hawaii are (20.037 N, 155.829 W).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299916.s005\n\n(TIF)\n\n### S1 Data.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299916.s006\n\n(ZIP)\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Justin Snow at Pacific Solutions, Gavin Key and Katie\nKey at Pacific Watersports, and David Mann at Loggerhead Instruments.\n\n## References\n\n  1. 1\\.
