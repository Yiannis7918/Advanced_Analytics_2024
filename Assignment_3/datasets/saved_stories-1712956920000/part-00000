Hutter also runs the Robotic Systems Lab at\nETH Zurich, arguably best known as the origin of the ANYmal quadruped robot\n(but it also does tons of other cool stuff).\n\nWe\u2019re doing our best to keep close tabs on the institute, because it\u2019s one of\na vanishingly small number of places that currently exist where roboticists\nhave the kind of long-term resources and vision necessary to make substantial\nprogress on really hard problems that aren\u2019t quite right for either industry\nor academia. The institute is still scaling up (and the branch in Zurich has\nonly just kicked things off), but we did spot some projects that the Boston\nfolks have been working on, and as you can see from the clips at the top of\nthis page, they\u2019re looking pretty cool.\n\nMeanwhile, we had a chance to check in with Marco Hutter to get a sense of\nwhat the Zurich office will be working on and how he\u2019s going to be solving all\nof the hard problems in robotics. All of them!\n\nHow much can you tell us about what you\u2019ll be working on at the AI Institute?\n\nMarco Hutter: If you know the research that I\u2019ve been doing in the past at ETH\nand with our startups, there\u2019s an overlap on making systems more mobile,\nmaking systems more able to interact with the world, making systems in general\nmore capable on the hardware and software side. And that\u2019s what the institute\nstrives for.\n\nThe institute describes itself as a research organization that aims to solve\nthe most important and fundamental problems in robotics and AI. What do you\nthink those problems are?\n\nMarco Hutter is the head of the AI Institute\u2019s new Zurich branch.Swiss\nRobotics Day\n\nHutter: There are lots of problems. If you\u2019re looking at robots today, we have\nto admit that they\u2019re still pretty stupid. The way they move, their capability\nof understanding their environment, the way they\u2019re able to interact with\nunstructured environments\u2014I think we\u2019re still lacking a lot of skills on the\nrobotic side to make robots useful in all of the tasks we wish them to do. So\nwe have the ambition of having these robots taking over all these dull, dirty,\nand dangerous jobs. But if we\u2019re honest, today the biggest impact is really\nonly for the dull part. And I think these dirty and dangerous jobs, where we\nreally need support from robots, that\u2019s still going to take a lot of\nfundamental work on the robotics and AI side to make enough progress for\nrobots to become useful tools.\n\nWhat is it about the institute that you think will help robotics make more\nprogress in these areas?\n\nHutter: I think the institute is one of these unique places where we are\ntrying to bring the benefits of the academic world and the benefits from this\ncorporate world together. In academia, we have all kinds of crazy ideas and we\ntry to develop them in all different directions, but at the same time, we have\nlimited engineering support, and we can only go so far. Making robust and\nreliable hardware systems is a massive effort, and that kind of engineering is\nmuch better done in a corporate lab.\n\nYou\u2019ve seen this a little bit with the type of work my lab has been doing in\nthe past. We built simple quadrupeds with a little bit of mobility, but in\norder to make them robust, we eventually had to spin it out. We had to bring\nit to the corporate world, because for a research group, a pure academic\ngroup, it would have been impossible. But at the same time, you\u2019re losing\nsomething, right? Once you go into your corporate world and you\u2019re running a\nbusiness, you have to be very focused; you can\u2019t be that explorative and free\nanymore.\n\nSo if you bring these two things together through the institute, with long-\nterm planning, enough financial support, and brilliant people both in the U.S.\nand Europe working together, I think that\u2019s what will hopefully help us make\nsignificant progress in the next couple of years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very different from a traditional company, where at some point you need\nto have a product that makes money. Here, it\u2019s really about solving problems\nand taking the next step.\u201d \u2014Marco Hutter, AI Institute\n\nAnd what will that actually mean in the context of dynamically mobile robots?\n\nHutter: If you look at Boston Dynamics\u2019 Atlas doing parkour, or ANYmal doing\nparkour, these are still demonstrations. You don\u2019t see robots running around\nin the forests or robots working in mines and doing all kinds of crazy\nmaintenance operations, or in industrial facilities, or construction sites,\nyou name it. We need to not only be able to do this once as a prototype\ndemonstration, but to have all the capabilities that bring that together with\nenvironmental perception and understanding to make this athletic intelligence\nmore capable and more adaptable to all kinds of different environments. This\nis not something that from today to tomorrow we\u2019re going to see it being\nrevolutionized\u2014it will be gradual, steady progress because I think there\u2019s\nstill a lot of fundamental work that needs to be done.\n\nI feel like the mobility of legged robots has improved a lot over the last\nfive years or so, and a lot of that progress has come from Boston Dynamics and\nalso from your lab. Do you feel the same?\n\nHutter: There has always been progress; the question is how much you can zoom\nin or zoom out. I think one thing has changed quite a bit, and that\u2019s the\navailability of robotic systems to all kinds of different research groups. If\nyou look back a decade, people had to build their own robots, they had to do\nthe control for the robots, they had to work on the perception for the robots,\nand putting everything together like that makes it extremely fragile and very\nchallenging to make something that works more than once. That has changed,\nwhich allows us to make faster progress.\n\nMarc Raibert (founder of the AI Institute) likes to show videos of mountain\ngoats to illustrate what robots should be (or will be?) capable of. Does that\nkind of thing inspire you as well?\n\nHutter: If you look at the animal kingdom, there\u2019s so many things you can draw\ninspiration from. And a lot of this stuff is not only the cognitive side; it\u2019s\nreally about pairing the cognitive side with the mechanical intelligence of\nthings like the simple-seeming hooves of mountain goats. But they\u2019re really\nnot that simple, they\u2019re pretty complex in how they interact with the\nenvironment. Having one of these things and not the other won\u2019t allow the\nanimal to move across its challenging environment. It\u2019s the same thing with\nthe robots.\n\nIt\u2019s always been like this in robotics, where you push on the hardware side,\nand your controls become better, so you hit a hardware limitation. So both\nthings have to evolve hand in hand. Otherwise, you have an over-dimensioned\nhardware system that you can\u2019t use because you don\u2019t have the right controls,\nor you have very sophisticated controls and your hardware system can\u2019t keep\nup.\n\nHow do you feel about all of the investment into humanoids right now, when\nquadrupedal robots with arms have been around for quite a while?\n\nHutter: There\u2019s a lot of ongoing research on quadrupeds with arms, and the\nnice thing is that these technologies that are developed for mobile systems\nwith arms are the same technologies that are used in humanoids. It\u2019s not\ndifferent from a research point of view, it\u2019s just a different form factor for\nthe system. I think from an application point of view, the story from all of\nthese companies making humanoids is that our environment has been adapted to\nhumans quite a bit. A lot of tasks are at the height of a human standing,\nright? A quadruped doesn\u2019t have the height to see things or to manipulate\nthings on a table. It\u2019s really application dependent, and I wouldn\u2019t say that\none system is better than the other.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * Q&A: Marc Raibert on the Boston Dynamics AI Institute \u203a\n  * Boston Dynamics AI Institute Targets Basic Research \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * The AI Institute Recruits Dr. Marco Hutter to Lead Its Zurich Office ... \u203a\n\nthe ai instituteboston dynamicszurichrobotics\n\nEvan Ackerman\n\nis a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum.

Farokh Atashzar at NYU\nTandon is working to change the way we view healthcare with intelligent,\ninteractive robotic and AI-driven assistive machines that can augment human\ncapabilities and break human barriers.\n\nNYU Tandon\n\nThis sponsored article is brought to you by NYU Tandon School of Engineering.\n\nTo address today\u2019s health challenges, especially in our aging society, we must\nbecome more intelligent in our approaches. Clinicians now have access to a\nrange of advanced technologies designed to assist early diagnosis, evaluate\nprognosis, and enhance patient health outcomes, including telemedicine,\nmedical robots, powered prosthetics, exoskeletons, and AI-powered smart\nwearables. However, many of these technologies are still in their infancy.\n\nThe belief that advancing technology can improve human health is central to\nresearch related to medical device technologies.

A team of\nexperienced engineers controlled each robot, and overhead safety tethers kept\nthem from falling over. The robots had to demonstrate mobility, sensing, and\nmanipulation\u2014which, with painful slowness, they did.\n\nThese robots were clearly research projects, but DARPA has a history of\ncatalyzing technology with a long-term view. The DARPA Grand and Urban\nChallenges for autonomous vehicles, in 2005 and 2007, formed the foundation\nfor today\u2019s autonomous taxis. So, after DRC ended in 2015 with several of the\nrobots successfully completing the entire final scenario, the obvious question\nwas: When would humanoid robots make the transition from research project to a\ncommercial product?\n\nKeep Reading \u2193 Show less\n\n{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}\n\nRobotics News\n\n## Pogo Stick Microcopter Bounces off Floors and Walls\n\n###\n\nHopcopter is a more efficient way to (mostly) fly\n\nEvan Ackerman\n\nis a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum.\n\n2 hours ago\n\n3 min read\n\n1\n\nHopcopter is a (mostly) flying drone that also hops to travel more\nefficiently.\n\nSongnan Bai, Runze Ding, Song Li, and Bingxuan Pu\n\ncrazyflie jumping robots quadrotor science robotics robotics\n\nWe tend to think about hopping robots from the ground up.

Several recently\npublished deep-dive analyses commissioned by NASA and the European Space\nAgency have thrown cold water on the hope that space solar power could\naffordably generate many gigawatts of clean energy in the near future. And yet\nthe dream lives on.\n\nThe dream achieved a kind of lift-off in January 2023. That\u2019s when SSPD-1, a\nsolar space-power demonstrator satellite carrying a bevy of new technologies\ndesigned at the California Institute of Technology, blasted into low Earth\norbit for a year-long mission.
