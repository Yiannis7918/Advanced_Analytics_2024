While\nchimpanzees are known to show aggression against each other \u2013 sometimes to the\npoint of death \u2013 bonobos have long been thought to live more harmoniously,\nwith no known killings. The difference has led to the theory that natural\nselection works against aggression in male bonobos.\n\nNow research has turned the idea on its head, revealing that bonobos show\nhigher rates of male-on-male aggression than chimpanzees \u2013 even when\nresearchers looked specifically at cases where the males came to blows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a species with such complex behaviour that just limiting the species to\nbeing a hippy, for this study it\u2019s not going to work. It\u2019s just too\nsimplistic,\u201d said Dr Maud Mouginot of Boston University, who is first author\nof the research.\n\n\u201cI think what we know now is that bonobos and chimpanzees use aggression and\nthey use it in different ways. And they have different strategies around it,\u201d\nshe said, adding that an interesting area to explore now was why and when\nthese different strategies evolved.\n\nWriting in the journal Current Biology, Mouginot and colleagues describe how\nthey followed 12 male bonobos across three communities at the Kokolopori\nBonobo Reserve in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and 14 male\nchimpanzees across two communities at Gombe national park in Tanzania.\n\nEach male was individually followed by the researchers during its waking\nhours, during which its interactions with other members of its species were\nrecorded, including aggressive physical contact, and other aggressive actions\nsuch as charging and chasing.\n\nOverall, the team recorded 521 aggressive interactions involving tracked\nbonobos over 2,047 hours, and 654 aggressive interactions among the identified\nchimpanzees over 7,309 hours.\n\nThe team say that despite previous studies finding chimpanzees show more\nsevere aggression \u2013 such as killings, infanticide and sexual coercion \u2013 the\nresults reveal aggressive acts between males were 2.8 times more frequent in\nbonobos than in chimpanzees, with acts involving physical contact specifically\nfound to be 3.0 times more frequent.\n\nFor both species, more aggressive males had greater success in mating with\nfemales.\n\nYet, while not quite the model of gentlemanly chivalry, male bonobos treated\nfemales differently to chimpanzees: the team found male-on-female aggression\nwas less common, and female-on-male aggression more common, in the former than\nthe latter \u2013 something the team put down to female bonobos often outranking\nmales in the social group.\n\n\u201cWe know from the literature that, for example, male and female [bonobos] form\na close association ... and we do not observe that in chimpanzees,\u201d said\nMouginot, noting that humans, too, form such associations.\n\nThe researchers add that while only 1% of aggressive acts among male bonobos\ninvolved the primates teaming up, the figure was 13% in chimpanzees \u2013 a\nfinding that may explain the lower frequency of aggression in chimpanzees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just more risky because of course if you have several individuals\nagainst you, you might be completely beat up,\u201d Mouginot said.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Animal behaviour\n  * Primatology\n  * Biology\n  * Animals\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
