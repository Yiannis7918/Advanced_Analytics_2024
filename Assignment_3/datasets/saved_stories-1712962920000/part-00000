In particular, the emphasis is on supporting complex\ncomputations which require a high level of integration of tools from different\nmathematical areas.\n\nThe development of OSCAR is supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft\nDFG within the Collaborative Research Center TRR 195.\n\nSee the About page for more information.\n\n## Getting started\n\nFor tutorials, see the Tutorials page, where pre-rendered notebooks showcase\nselected things the software developed in the OSCAR project can already do.\n\nIf you wish to contribute to the OSCAR development, see the Installation page\nfor instructions on how to install it, and also check out our community page.\n\nNote that OSCAR has not reached a first public release yet, and its parts\nshould be treated as a technology preview. See the News page for announcements\nabout OSCAR development.\n\n## Get in touch\n\nA great place to ask questions about OSCAR and discuss all aspects of it is\nvia Slack \u2013 click here to join it.
