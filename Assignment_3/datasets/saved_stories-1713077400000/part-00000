Spinal cords that received random unpleasantness did\nnot learn. Credit: RIKEN\n\nAya Takeoka at the RIKEN Center for Brain Science (CBS) in Japan and\ncolleagues have discovered the neural circuitry in the spinal cord that allows\nbrain-independent motor learning. Published in Science, the study found two\ncritical groups of spinal cord neurons, one necessary for new adaptive\nlearning, and another for recalling adaptations once they have been learned.\nThe findings could help scientists develop ways to assist motor recovery after\nspinal cord injury.\n\nScientists have known for some time that motor output from the spinal cord can\nbe adjusted through practice even without a brain. This has been shown most\ndramatically in headless insects, whose legs can still be trained to avoid\nexternal cues.\n\nUntil now, no one has figured out exactly how this is possible, and without\nthis understanding, the phenomenon is not much more than a quirky fact.\n\nAs Takeoka explains, \"Gaining insights into the underlying mechanism is\nessential if we want to understand the foundations of movement automaticity in\nhealthy people and use this knowledge to improve recovery after spinal cord\ninjury.\"\n\nBefore jumping into the neural circuitry, the researchers first developed an\nexperimental setup that allowed them to study mouse spinal cord adaptation,\nboth learning and recall, without input from the brain. Each test had an\nexperimental mouse and a control mouse whose hindlegs dangled freely. If the\nexperimental mouse's hindleg drooped down too much it was electrically\nstimulated, emulating something a mouse would want to avoid. The control mouse\nreceived the same stimulation at the same time, but not linked to its own\nhindleg position.\n\nAfter just 10 minutes, they observed motor learning only in the experimental\nmice; their legs remained high up, avoiding any electrical stimulation. This\nresult showed that the spinal cord can associate an unpleasant feeling with\nleg position and adapt its motor output so that the leg avoids the unpleasant\nfeeling, all without any need for a brain.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, they repeated the 10-minute test but reversed the\nexperimental and control mice. The original experimental mice still kept their\nlegs up, indicating that the spinal cord retained a memory of the past\nexperience, which interfered with new learning.\n\nHaving thus established both immediate learning, as well as memory, in the\nspinal cord, the team then set out to examine the neural circuitry that makes\nboth possible. They used six types of transgenic mice, each with a different\nset of spinal neurons disabled, and tested them for motor learning and\nlearning reversal. They found that mice hindlimbs did not adapt to avoid the\nelectrical shocks after neurons toward the top of the spinal cord were\ndisabled, particularly those that express the gene Ptf1a.\n\nWhen they examined the mice during learning reversal, they found that\nsilencing the Ptf1a-expressing neurons had no effect. Instead, a group of\nneurons in the bottom, ventral, part of the spinal cord that express the En1\ngene was critical.\n\nWhen these neurons were silenced the day after learning avoidance, the spinal\ncords acted as if they had never learned anything. The researchers also\nassessed memory recall on the second day by repeating the initial learning\nconditions.\n\nThey found that in wildtype mice, hindlimbs stabilized to reach the avoidance\nposition faster than they did on the first day, indicating recall. Exciting\nthe En1 neurons during recall increased this speed by 80%, indicating enhanced\nmotor recall.\n\n\"Not only do these results challenge the prevailing notion that motor learning\nand memory are solely confined to brain circuits,\" says Takeoka, \"but we\nshowed that we could manipulate spinal cord motor recall, which has\nimplications for therapies designed to improve recovery after spinal cord\ndamage.\"\n\nMore information: Simon Lavaud et al, Two inhibitory neuronal classes govern\nacquisition and recall of spinal sensorimotor adaptation, Science (2024).
