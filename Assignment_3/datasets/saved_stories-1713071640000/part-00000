After all, new technologies have repeatedly\nupended civilian life. Why shouldn\u2019t they do the same for the military?\n\nThe future of warfare?\n\nThere is a lot to be said for this view. Weapons that can guide themselves to\nthe target have the potential to dramatically change how wars are fought,\ncutting the number of weapons required to achieve a result, and reducing\ncollateral damage. Some types of ships might become essentially obsolete,\nunable to justify their cost in the face of the new threat, while new systems\nwill have to be developed to counter the threat. In fact, this stands to be\nthe biggest revolution in warfare in decades.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem for the prophets of the drone. While the above\nparagraph is 100% true, it\u2019s in the wrong tense. Everything in it already\nhappened in the period 1940-2000, and the situation in the naval/military\nworld today is the direct result of all of this. Any further improvements at\nthis point look set to be more evolutionary than revolutionary, and after most\nof a century of evolution, the systems we do have are very good. Displacing\nthem will be difficult given their head start, and the complete unsuitability\nof civilian systems for the military environment.\n\nThe present of warfare\n\nThe basic reason for this is that a drone loaded with explosives and set to\nfly into a target has another name: the cruise missile. The concept dates back\nto WWI, with serious efforts in the US and Britain to produce unmanned planes\nthat could be guided to the target by autopilot or radio signals. This was\npremature, but WWII saw the technology reach some level of maturity, with both\nsides producing effective weapons. The Germans in particular caused\nsignificant consternation among Allied navies, consternation heightened when\nthe Japanese began using cruise missiles with an organic guidance system to\ndeadly effect. As a result, this new threat was one of the dominant concerns\nof the early postwar years, giving rise to new weapons, new technologies and\nnew tactics. The sinking of the Eilat brought this home to anyone who had\nmissed it, and Western navies responded with even more defenses and drones of\ntheir own.\n\nBut recent years have seen massive advantages in drone technology, with\nsystems becoming cheaper and more ubiquitous. Surely this will spill over into\nthe defense world, making cruise missiles far cheaper and allowing them to\noverrun targets by weight of numbers? Again, not so much. The basic problem is\nthat the proliferation of civilian drones is driven by improvements in a few\nspecific areas, notably cheap control electronics, electric motors and\nbatteries. None of these have much relevance to cruise missile technology. The\nmilitary has always been able to afford expensive electronics, and many of the\nother new capabilities have been in use for the last quarter-century in\nweapons like JDAM and JSOW.\n\nGPS in military service\n\nThe big problem with the use of electric propulsion is the main issue with the\ndrone revolution thesis more broadly: the performance requirements of cruise\nmissiles (and military systems in general) flow directly from their missions,\nand those missions don\u2019t magically get easier if they\u2019re done by drones\ninstead of whatever is doing them now. For instance, say we want to build a\ndrone to replace the F-35 as a strike platform against static targets.^1 Well,\nit\u2019s going to need a warhead capable of taking out most targets of interest,\nand some of those are pretty hard to kill no matter how accurately you hit.\nFigure that this means a payload of at least 500 lb. Right off the bat, it\u2019s a\nlot bigger than any consumer drone, and even most commercial ones. Second, it\nneeds a range of at least a couple hundred miles, so it can be launched from\nsimilar bases to the ones the F-35 uses. Third, it needs to be fast enough\nthat it\u2019s not trivial to shoot down, which means at least high subsonic. This\nrules out electric propulsion and even most propellers, so at this point,\nwe\u2019re looking at a small jet engine. Lastly, it has to be able to navigate to\nand hit the target at night, in bad weather and in the face of\ncountermeasures, so we can\u2019t just stick a GPS chip and a camera in and call it\ngood. This isn\u2019t an impossible problem, but it\u2019s going to drive up the cost of\nthe system quite a lot. But even with all of those compromises from the\noriginal vision, this drone could still be useful for some cases, right? While\nit\u2019s certainly not cheap to build one of these things, it\u2019s still going to be\nhandy for cases where the target is just too dangerous for a manned aircraft,\nisn\u2019t it?\n\nIowa launches a drone strike in the 1980s\n\nOf course it is. Which is why something with these characteristics has been a\nmainstay of the US arsenal for the last 30 years. So long as there isn\u2019t a\ntechnological shift that demands an entirely new architecture, incremental\nimprovements can easily be incorporated into the basic Tomahawk, as has\nhappened repeatedly over the years. And any technological shift is likely to\nrequire more capability, not less, pushing us further out of the territory\nwhere the civilian drone has any relevance. The recent trend in hypersonic\nweapons is probably the best example of this. There is some room for new\ndevelopments to push the bounds of the trade space for weapons, but the\nresults tend to be far more evolutionary than revolutionary. Tomahawk itself\nis one of the biggest exceptions to this, as it gave the Navy\u2019s surface ships\nand submarines a strike capability they had essentially never had before, and\neven it didn\u2019t totally upend conventional strike warfare. So while weapons\nlike JDAM, SDB and the Israeli Harop^2 have added new capabilities, none have\nmanaged to change the fundamentals.\n\nIAI Harop\n\nOK, but are we sure that we couldn\u2019t just substitute a huge quantity of cheap\nsystems for the expensive ones? Quantity has a quality all its own, and if we\nthrow enough drones at a carrier, it\u2019s going to die. Again, no. In theory, you\ncould overwhelm a carrier by throwing drones at it, but for cases where the\n\u201cdrones\u201d aren\u2019t just cruise missiles, this is like attempting to break down a\ndoor by throwing mashed potatoes at it.^3 No matter how much you use or how\nhard you throw, it\u2019s still not a good plan relative to using something more\neffective. Obviously, weapons capable of defending against cruise missiles\nwill be more than capable of taking out cheap drones, although the equally\nobvious counter there is that the defensive missile will cost far more than\nthe drone does. But any drone that isn\u2019t just a cruise missile will be a far\neasier target than most modern weapons, which opens up the possibility of much\ncheaper countermeasures. For instance, something with the performance of a\nReaper drone would be considered a relatively low-performance target in 1945.\nThe carrier\u2019s fighter pilots would no doubt burst with delight at the\npossibility of getting to go up and make dozens of gun kills, at least until\nthey got bored of it. Phalanx would also be extremely effective in this case,\nas it\u2019s usually credited with getting the third round on target against much\nfaster cruise missiles, and each round costs a mere $30. And of course there\nare several hundred SAMs on the carrier group, and using them is cheaper than\nlosing the carrier.\n\nDefinitely not the future of warfare\n\nThe situation gets even more absurd if you propose using quadcopters. The\nfirst line of defense there is the sheer difficulty of getting them in range.\nHelicopters are not particularly efficient, and batteries are not very energy-\ndense, so range is limited to low double-digit miles at most. Whatever\nplatform is to launch them has to get within range without being destroyed\nfirst, at a range that is well within the carrier\u2019s defense perimeter. Even if\nit was to somehow survive to launch its payload, the quadcopters themselves\nare going to be extremely vulnerable to electronic warfare. A modern naval\nradar like SPY-1 is easily capable of putting out enough power to fry a\nquadcopter, if not actually melt it in mid-air.^4 5\u2032\u2032 VT rounds should also be\nquite effective, and at a lower cost than the quadcopters themselves. There\u2019s\nalso the question of what said quadcopters would do upon reaching the target.\nTheir payload is quite limited, and while they could do extensive damage to\nsurface features, they aren\u2019t going to actually sink ships.\n\nAPKWS test\n\nAnd that\u2019s merely the situation if the threat was to spring up today, fully\nformed. But building this kind of anti-carrier system would take time, and\nthings get much worse for it if the US has the ability to respond by finding\ncheap counters that can destroy the economic warfare argument. For the outer\ndefenses, one likely option is APKWS, a 70mm Hydra rocket modified with a\nlaser seeker. A single Super Hornet should be able to carry up to 76 of these,\nand tests have already been carried out showing them to be effective against\ncruise missiles. Closer in, radar-directed guns would be tremendously lethal,\nwith the 57mm used on the LCS a likely standout in this role due to a\ncombination of range and rate of fire. And there\u2019s the upcoming threat of\nlasers, which will be tremendously effective against slow drones at a cost of\nonly a few cents a shot. With those, this kind of threat would be as obsolete\nas horse cavalry.^5 And all of this ignores the soft-kill options, which are\nparticularly likely to be effective against cheap drones that lack the ECCM\ncapabilities of proper cruise missiles. An arbitrarily large attack might be\ndefeated with a couple of helicopters, a giant banner of a CVN and some smoke\nrounds for the SRBOC. And for one last nail in the coffin, there\u2019s the problem\nof deploying giant swarms of drones. The USN is likely to notice them before\nthey are actually launched, and engage in some drone-on-drone warfare, which\nshould thin the herd considerably.\n\nDon\u2019t expect same-day drone delivery of explosives to be offered by your\nfavorite online vendor any time soon\n\nOn the whole, the arrival of unmanned weapons has already revolutionized naval\nwarfare about as much as they are going to. Things on land might well be\ndifferent, as they allow greater integration with small units, but this is not\ntrue at sea. Missiles have changed a lot of things, the most notable impact at\nsea being to give surface ships capabilities that were previously reserved for\naircraft carriers. But proponents of an ongoing drone revolution seem to\nbelieve that making missiles worse will somehow make them unstoppable, or at\nleast give them cost leverage over existing weapons. But this strategy relies\non a complete lack of understanding of how modern military weapons work, and\nin practice, changes in missiles are likely to be in the direction of more\ncapability and possibly more expense, not replacing them with swarms of very\ncheap and very useless \u201cdrones\u201d.\n\n2023 Postcript: This was written shortly before war broke out in Ukraine, and\nI think it\u2019s held up reasonably well. The biggest mistake was one of framing,\nin that I was implicitly looking at the role of drones in high-end naval/air\nwarfare, and didn\u2019t fully account for their impact on scales that are\nessentially irrelevant at sea. Yes, in retrospect, I should have been more\nclear that drones did have the potential to give new capabilities to ground\ntroops that hadn\u2019t reached them during the missile revolution. That said, the\nbasic thesis with regards to high-end systems seems to have held up reasonably\nwell. I would also point out that we\u2019re seeing a transitional stage in Ukraine\ntoday, and I expect that over the next decade, infantry/vehicle anti-drone\nsystems will get significantly better relative to drones.\n\n1 Note that this is only one of the F-35\u2032s jobs, and not the hardest one by\nany means. \u21d1\n\n2 While this attracted a fair bit of press back in 2020, it\u2019s essentially an\nanti-radiation missile that just happens to have a really long loiter time and\nthe ability to land itself if it doesn\u2019t find a target. But it took a ton of\nengineering to make it work, and it\u2019s still built by a major defense company\nfor defense system prices. \u21d1\n\n3 And if they are cruise missiles, I\u2019ve covered that too. \u21d1\n\n4 This is also a serious issue for other missiles, although they\u2019re probably\nbig enough to get some hardening, and they\u2019ll also move a lot faster. \u21d1\n\n5 Yes, I know when the US military last participated in a cavalry charge. The\ncomparison is deliberate. \u21d1\n\n  * by bean\n  * 56 comment(s)\n\n## Comments\n\n  1.

If you\u2019re not buzzing CIWS systems and planning on not getting\ndetected before you\u2019re pretty close to the target I\u2019m not sure Mach 0.5\ndiffers from Mach 2 so why waste money on powerful engines, and you can fly\ncruise missiles (or suicide drones) far more aggressively than JDAM-armed\nplanes when you are mostly but not entirely sure you are not going to\nencounter anti-air.\n\nStill, the difference here is more that armies that never had the capability\nto deploy cruise missiles in significant numbers now can, which is pretty big\nI think.\n\n> I think there\u2019s a fairly hard limit on how low that number can get.

There are definite gains to be found in making sure\nthe hits are in the right spot relative to just hitting anywhere on the ship.\nMy point is just that given how big and tough ships are, I\u2019d still rather have\na Harpoon instead of an SDB.\n\n@Miles\n\nI thought you were probably joking, but wasn\u2019t sure.

January 11, 2022Eric Rall said...\n\n> CVEs used to be a thing that made sense, after all\n\nAs I understand it, there were a couple things going on there. One is that WW2\ncarrier aircraft were a lot smaller than modern, with e.g. an F4F Wildcat\nbeing about 1/6 the dry weight of an F35, in addition to being enormously\nsimpler to maintain and operate. Combined, that means the minimum viable size\nof a ship that can operate a worthwhile air wing was quite a bit smaller\nduring WW2 than today. And that\u2019s leaving aside questions of runway length for\ntakeoff and recovery, which is traditionally one of the main forcing functions\nfor minimum carrier size although S/VTOL-capable aircraft like the F35C or the\nHarrier can mitigate runway requirements.\n\nThe other is that CVEs were build for a specific mission that was a huge deal\nfor the US and Britain in WW2: providing air cover for reconnaissance, anti-\nsubmarine warfare, and non-line-of-battle combat for convoys and smaller task\nforces when they\u2019re out of effective range of land-based air cover. For this\nrole, you don\u2019t need a particularly big air wing, you can get away with a much\nslower ship especially on convoy duty (you just need to keep up with\nmerchantmen and troopships, vs a fleet carrier that needs to be able to chase\ndown or stay out of gun range from battleships and battlecruiser), and you can\nskimp on armor because you\u2019re not intending to send the ship into battle. You\njust need a cheap ship that can host air cover for your convoys so you can\nconcentrate your fleet carriers at the strategic point of decision.\n\nIn a modern context, that niche isn\u2019t really there, as land-based and fleet-\ncarrier-based aircraft are enormously more capable, as are other ASW platforms\n(attack subs, light surface warships, helicopters, etc). If you want air cover\nin the middle of the Atlantic, you can do that with land-based aircraft and\nmid-air refueling.\n\n  26.

Now,\nsurface escorts can self-host airpower instead of needing a dedicated ship to\ndo it for them. Land-based MPAs fill a slightly different niche from shipboard\naircraft.\n\n  28. January 11, 2022Jade Nekotenshi said...\n\nI think some of the confusion about mini-carriers might come from an excessive\nfocus on fighters, too. I mean, we have STOVL fighters, why aren\u2019t those just\nas good? Folks forget entirely about AWACS, tankers, logistics, etc, as well\nas about the ability to maintain and repair aircraft and carry fuel and\nordnance for them. I see that confusion a lot when folks propose sticking a\nsingle F-35 on a destroyer, say. What would a single fighter be able to do\nthat actually needs doing, that a helicopter doesn\u2019t do better? (Never mind\nthat STOVL is not VTOL, and even if F-35B can technically do a vertical\ntakeoff, it limits payload unacceptably.)\n\n  29. January 11, 2022Blackshoe said...\n\nIMHO, the biggest thing that I think \u201cdrones\u201d (ugh) will do for military\noperations is to make it a lot easier and cheaper to put lots of mobile,\nconnected sensor platforms all over the place to increase awareness. For the\nquestion about undersea drones, roving platforms that have a floating beacon\nthat can report back to base their findings to help gain information about\nwhat\u2019s going in under the waves. Also decoys of varying quality.\n\nAlso, I think the cheapening of advanced sensors means that a lot of countries\nin 10-15 years will be able to get into the HALE/MALE (probably MALE, let\u2019s be\nhonest) game, which could be really useful for countries that have big EEZs.\nHeck, I can even see a world where poor countries rent out MALEs to do MDA for\ntheir Coast Guard from random contractor companies; bonus points if they do it\nusing UN grants or something.\n\n  30.

That\u2019s helpful. I also wonder if a rotary-\nwinged AEW drone would be a useful thing to have - not as good as a Hawkeye\nbut you can stuff one on an LHD or LPD, and maybe even on an LCS or DDG in a\npinch, thus allowing at least some amount of AEW coverage even if the CV takes\na hit or a cheeky hidden SAM battery splashes your Hawkeye or something like\nthat.

A Triton isn\u2019t that\ndifferent from a P-8, except cheaper to operate and able to stay out longer.\nAre they better? Sure. But they\u2019re 20% or 50% or maybe 100% better, which\nmakes them fit neatly within the structures we have today. To be really\nrevolutionary, you need to be at least 1000% better, like Fritz-X or\nPaveway/JDAM, or to give an entirely new capability that just wasn\u2019t there\nbefore, like Tomahawk.
