Conclusion\n\n### Struggles of Running Image Generators: Limited Use and Frustration\n\nNew innovations like AI image generators are gathering popularity. With tools\nlike midjourney and DALL-E 3, people can generate amazing images just with\ntheir imagination.\n\nThe one thing common in all of the tools is that there is pricing involved, So\nif you plan on generating images for free, then you will be limited either by\na free trial or a limited credit system.\n\nFor example, if you are a designer and you want to create image assets,\nmockups, or design ideas, there would be a lot of iterations involved, which\nis expensive.\n\nSooner or later, after some usage, your credits will become depleted and you\nwill no longer be able to generate images.\n\n### What technology does Image Generation use?\n\nThe technology that these image generators use is called Stable Diffusion.\n\nStable diffusion requires a lot of resources. Making it expensive to be given\nto everyone for free.\n\nSo I thought, Why not run stable diffusion using my own resources? That way, I\nwon't need to deal with payments, and I can create as many images as I want.\n\nSo I will be demonstrating by the end of the article how I was able to run AI\nimage generators on my own for absolutely free.\n\nHere you can see that I have given a simple prompt, and I got the image\ngenerated in high quality.\n\nLet's see how the stable diffusion technology works, so we can start running\nit on our own.\n\n1 powerful reason a day nudging you to read so that you can read more, and\nlevel up in life.\n\nSent throughout the year. Absolutely FREE.\n\n### How the Tech Behind AI Image Generators Works\n\nTo learn about how AI image generation works, we need to know about Stable\nDiffusion. We can think of stable diffusion like the real diffusion we have\nlearned in school.\n\nThere will be a clear beaker of water, we will add a few drops of dye, The dye\ndiffuses throughout the liquid, until it reaches a state of equilibrium.\n\nNow let's apply the same concept to real stable diffusion.\n\nFor training a stable diffusion model, we will start with a process called\nForward diffusion.\n\nIn forward diffusion, we take an image and add noise to it. For those who\ndon't know, think of noise like the static you see when the TV gets\ndisconnected.\n\nThe type of noise we are adding here is called gaussian noise. This process is\ndone multiple times, so there will be multiple layers of noise.\n\nAfter performing forward diffusion, Reverse Diffusion is done. This involves\nreversing the gaussian noise until we get the original image.\n\nThe model gradually starts learning how to predict images from noise.\n\nSimilarly, forward and reverse diffusion is done on millions of images to\nproperly train the model.\n\nAfter the training is done, we can make a random noise, and the model will\npredict the image.\n\nWe may have a doubt: How is the model able to generate images from text\nprompts?\n\nImages used for training have an alt text associated with them, which\ndescribes what the image is about. This way, each image is linked to a text,\nand the model gradually finds the relationship between the text and the\nimages.\n\nThis is how stable diffusion models work in a simple way. Now let's get the\nstable diffusion running on your own.\n\n### Let's get stable diffusion running\n\n#### Image generation using basic prompts\n\nNow that we have a brief idea of how stable diffusion works, let's start\nrunning one on our own.\n\nFor this article, I will be using a tool that is very simple to use and\nconfigure, called Fooocus\n\nYou can setup Fooocus on either on your own machine (Verify you meet the\nminimum requirements) or through Google colab if you don't meet the minimum\nrequirements. For this demo, I will be showing you how to run it via Google\nColab.\n\nYou can use the following Google Colab file to start your stable diffusion.\n\nPress the play button, and you can run the following code snippet.\n\nWait for a while, and you can see the following lines in the logs:\n\nClick the gradio.live link; this is the link to the UI for stable diffusion.\n\nOnce you open the link, you can see a textbox; just type out your prompt and\nclick Generate\n\nFor example, I will try to generate an image of the Taj Mahal.\n\nYou can see that there are two images generated from the prompt.\n\nThere are many other options available in this tool, such as input image,\ninpaint/outpaint, and describe images, which you can try exploring on your\nown.\n\nTo have more tweaking capabilities, you can press the \"advanced\" checkbox.\n\nThis gives us options like setting the performance, on how fast you would like\nto see the outputs, the aspect ratio of the image, and the number of images\nyou want to generate.\n\n#### Tweaking the Image Generator for better outputs\n\nSometimes we may not be satisfied with the images that are generated. For\nexample: I'm entering the following prompt.\n\na cute little bird in the tree, singing,cartoon\n\nI get the following image.\n\nI mentioned Cartoon in the prompt. However, the images I got look realistic,\nrather than looking like cartoons.\n\nThere are 2 solutions to this problem\n\n1\\. Styles\n\nThe first option is to change the style. Styles are basically additional\nprompts, you can check the Fooocus style reference to know more about each\nstyle.\n\nTo select a style, Click Advanced checkbox and Click Style.\n\nI'll try SAI Comic Book style and generate the output\n\nIt gives a good result. However if you want a certain cartoon style, you can\ntry to use LoRA models instead.\n\n2\\. LoRA Models\n\nLorA Models apply small tweaks to the stable diffusion model, So we can tweak\nthe stable diffusion model to have more information related to cartoons.\n\nIf you want a more detailed explanation of LoRA, you can refer our article.\n\nWe can utilize a website called CivitAI to download LoRA Models. Fooocus uses\nSDXL 1.0 model.\n\n  1. Go to CivitAI and click models\n  2. Click on filters and select LoRA and SDXL 1.0\n\nAfter applying the filter, I found a LoRA Model which can be used.\n\nClick the download icon and you will get a J_cartoon.safetensors file. You\nneed to place this safetensors file in the following path of Foooocus\nFooocus/models/loras/\n\nMake sure to restart fooocus after this step.\n\nConfiguring Image Generator to use the installed LoRA Model\n\nDo the following steps to use the newly installed LoRA model:\n\n  1. Click the Advanced Checkbox.\n  2. Click Model\n  3. We can see the list of LoRAs being used, on the second slot choose J_cartoon.safetensors\n\nThe LoRA will only get used if the proper Trigger word is used in the prompt.\n\nIn the Trigger Words Row, we can see the trigger word is j_cartoon So, My new\nprompt will be\n\na cute little bird in the tree, singing,cartoon,j_cartoon\n\nSee, I have included the trigger word in the prompt so that the image will be\ncartoony. When clicking generate, I get the following image:.\n\nThe output now looks cartoony as desired. In a similar way, we can install any\nLoRA model and tweak the stable diffusion model to our liking.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have observed through this article how we can get image generation done\nwith little effort and no cost. The world of stable diffusion is a constantly\ngrowing area, and there are so many things to explore. You can even make your\nown LoRA model based on your images. Other than Fooocus, there are tools like\nAutomatic1111 and ComfyUI, which are more advanced compared to the one we\ndemoed right now.\n\nFeedZap: Read 2X Books This Year\n\nFeedZap helps you consume your books through a healthy, snackable feed, so\nthat you can read more with less time, effort and energy.\n\n## Sign up for more like this.\n\nEnter your email\n\nSubscribe\n\nFeatured\n\n## Want to Join the Top 1%?
