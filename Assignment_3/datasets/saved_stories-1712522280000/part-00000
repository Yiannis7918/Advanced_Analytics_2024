Even the ability\nto make a release hinged on a leftover API token. At that time it became\npretty clear that I'd be doing most of the work, but the whole time I was\ntrying to operate in a way that would follow whatever my best guess was\nregarding the project's philosophy thus far. A year later I got admin access\nto GitHub and another year later to PyPI as well. Slowly over time I was\ngetting a bit more confident in making changes and was able to steer the\nproject in a slightly new direction. Also at a very late time, without any\nfanfare, I finally got confident to ask for donations for my work on MkDocs.\n(I'll expand on this part in a reply here.)The entire time (that'd be for over\n4 years now), me and @squidfunk were in disagreement about many things, but\nthat was OK most of the time, he was doing his thing and I was doing my thing.\nI did explicitly ask him that I'd like to get more feedback regarding what\nMkDocs could be doing and to share ideas more. I also at one point inquired to\nincrease our collaboration and contributed to mkdocs-material. But ultimately\nour conflicts led to @squidfunk unilaterally deciding to never again chat\nprivately, only publicly. I don't think that was justified, but that's been\nthe situation for a while now. Maintaining MkDocs has been really lonely,\nwhich, sure, for the most part is my fault, but still.But the fact remained\nthat we were all in the MkDocs organization on GitHub. And it remained\nbaffling to me how I am supposed to keep a person in the organization that I\ncan't even contact and who was never really doing anything for MkDocs itself\nanyway. One day this got to me, and without thinking too much, I dropped\n@squidfunk from the organization, so that it is clear that he does not in fact\nrepresent MkDocs. Upon which he decided to publicly complain about it - both\non GitHub and as a passive-aggressive cryptic remark on Twitter.Then all of a\nsudden, after 7 years of doing exactly nothing for MkDocs, @tomchristie\nstepped in without having any context, declared that there are \"communication\nissues\" (yeah, you bet...), removed me as admin, added @squidfunk back, and\nthus forced me to negotiate my status. @pawamoy created a chat room where I\nwas thoroughly baffled how I'm supposed to resolve a conflict with @squidfunk\nin a semi-public setting if he's not willing to resolve anything in a private\nsetting. I've been literally losing sleep over this for weeks, but ultimately\nI think there's nothing for me to say there, and nothing to be\ngained.Considering this, I am completely winding down my work on MkDocs, and\nprobably also mkdocstrings and most other projects. I will still complete one\nlast release of MkDocs along with the release notes, if that will be\nallowed.This choice is not something I'd prefer to do, because being able to\ngive my experience to the community was always the main highlight, and I will\nalways miss it. But I will not take this level of disrespect.At this time I\nwould ask the admins to coordinate any ownership changes with me, and from my\nside I promise to likewise not make any changes. Luckily we do now have an\nactual communication channel with the admin, so that's convenient, I\nsuppose.If an alternate communication channel becomes needed, we can use\nhttps://github.com/oprypin/mkdocs/discussions/4, or the Gitter->Element chat\nis available.  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?

For now I am keeping this as is.  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?

Again, I feel I need to\nstress that I always have admired and supported your work. However, I feel\nthat your representation of things is a little skewed towards giving me the\nblame. Also, I'm not sure I understand why kicking me out of the MkDocs\norganization was necessary when Tom was the one who added us to the team. To\nthe interested reader, here's how the last 4 years played out from my point of\nview. I've tried to resolve the situation countless times, but sadly to no\navail.Additionally, saying that I have done nothing for MkDocs is not quite\nright. Albeit I'm not a core team member, I was tagged many times, took part\nin countless conversations, gave feedback from a theme and plugin author\nperspective, helped out to solve issues and proposed several PRs. As one can\nimagine, my time is pretty much tied to Material for MkDocs, a project that\nhas become (almost) as popular as MkDocs itself, but I try my very best to\nhelp out in the entire ecosystem whenever I get tagged.That being said, it's\nreally sad to see you leave. Your input and work on this project was insanely\nvaluable and despite our differences I always tried to be respectful. I\nrespect your decision and wish you all the best for your future projects and\nendeavors.PS: Yes, I blocked you on Gitter for the reasons mentioned in the\nlinked comment, but my email address is located in every file that I ever\nreleased on GitHub. If you want to reach me privately, even now, it has always\nbeen and will always be possible.  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?

The work you've done has been\nextremely valuable to the community. You will be missed.  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?

And even sadder to see the context this is based on.My\nbiggest fear now is, that MkDocs will receive a negative hit in terms of\ncontributions and updates, causing the situation it had several years ago\nbefore maintainership was moved.I would've loved to help and contribute\nmyself, but I lack the experience with python to make code contributions, so\nat most would've my additions be documentation changes, which I saw barely any\nreasons for...Either way, I hope you can recover some of your strength back\noprypin. And I would really love to see you around at places here on GitHub in\nthe future, even if it was just for comments or alike. Take care!  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?

I don't use (nor\nreally like tbh) Gitter. Tho if that is the only way, then I'll probs use it\nto chat with you, as I have a few questions I would like to ask you about\nprivately. Only if you're up for it of course.  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?
