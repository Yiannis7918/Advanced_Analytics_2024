This does not mean that the entirety of\nthese applications uses React Native, since the company makes extensive use of\na technique Sciandra calls \u201cbrownfield development,\u201d extending an existing\ncodebase with new features using React Native. It is also being used in\nCopilot in various ways, which Sciandra said was a \u201cbig success\u201d but that \u201cI\u2019m\nonly going to tease it today, there are going to be more details later this\nyear.\u201d\n\nWhen did Microsoft start using React Native? \u201cIt\u2019s a bit convoluted. There\nwere different sides of the company, but they started using it more or less as\nsoon as it became available, 2015-2016,\u201d Sciandra told DevClass. \u201cSkype was\none of the first ones to invest, and similarly in the Office and Windows\norganizations, they started collaborating right away. Over time these\ndifferent efforts grew into bigger investments from different organizations,\nand now Xbox is also heavily invested into this platform. We have React Native\nWindows and React Native macOS platforms that everyone can use in open source.\nAnd that requires a lot of collaboration with Meta, and other companies like\nAmazon, and one of the main things I do is ensuring that these collaborations\nacross the companies are all coordinated to make this platform better.\u201d\n\nWhat is the attraction of React native to Microsoft, when the company has\nother choices for cross platform? \u201cFirst of all, JavaScript hire-ability,\u201d\nsaid Sciandra. \u201cYou have the biggest pool to fish from.\u201d Other languages such\nas C++ or C# are \u201cmuch more hardcore languages, more complicated,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnother one is that we have web versions of all our apps ... most of them are\nusing React as one of the key components, so having React Native as an option\nallows for focused investment in the React space.\u201d\n\nThe ability to use React Native for brownfield development is also key. \u201cIt is\nnot an all or nothing option. Other cross-platform solutions exist but usually\nyou need to write everything using the solution. You need to start from\nscratch. With React Native you add this layer on top of your existing projects\nand can much more easily try just one screen,\u201d he told us.\n\nIn practice, is TypeScript rather than JavaScript used? \u201cI think almost\neveryone using React Native uses TypeScript,\u201d said Sciandra. The ubiquity of\nJavaScript remains an advantage. \u201cThere is a massive community, a massive set\nof libraries you can leverage,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother feature of React Native is that it uses native operating system\ncontrols, as opposed to frameworks like Google\u2019s Flutter which generally draw\ntheir own controls. \u201cThat means that the OS running the app knows what\u2019s going\non,\u201d Sciandra told us. This has benefits for navigation and optimization, as\nwell as ensuring a native look and feel.\n\nSciandra is also open about some of the trade-offs involved in using React\nNative. One of the biggest is \u201chow alive and dynamic this space is now,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cHaving to keep up with a company like Meta where every commit goes into\naction in a couple of hours ... that is one of the main complexities.\u201d Part of\nhis role is to work with Meta and others to \u201cmake sure that releases are\nreliable, stable and predictable.\u201d\n\nReact Native is open source, but the repositories for Android and iOS are\nmanaged by Facebook whereas those for Windows and macOS are managed by\nMicrosoft. \u201cThat means we need to keep up with the code base,\u201d said Sciandra.\n\nThere is plenty of change on the way. Meta has been redesigning the core\ninternals with a new architecture, currently still designated experimental,\nbut which will become the default. The implication is that React Native\nadoption means being ready to refactor code frequently as the framework gets\nupdated.\n\nHow does React Native compare to other approaches such as Electron, using a\nweb view, which also uses JavaScript or TypeScript to create a desktop app?\nMeta migrated Messenger from Electron to React Native on Windows and macOS,\nSciandra told us. \u201cThey have seen very significant improvements in both\nperformance and binary size.\u201d\n\nUsing a web view though makes it easy to share code between web and desktop or\nmobile, whereas with React Native this is not so good. \u201cThe reason why React\nand React Native are two separate projects is that React Native requires some\ncustom code that is React-like, but you cannot use React code directly,\u201d said\nSciandra. \u201cFor example, for anything that is a component libarary or a design\nsystem, you cannot share that easily. You need to build custom components for\nReact Native.\u201d\n\nThis may change though. React Strict DOM is under development and \u201cthe idea\nhere is what if we figure out a way to make UI written for web work directly\nin React Native,\u201d said Sciandra.\n\nSciandra\u2019s presentation, to a somewhat sceptical QCon audience, was called\n\u201cHow Microsoft leverages React Native for strategic advantage.\u201d The topic is\nworth attention for developers interested in cross-platform development using\nnative controls, even if Microsoft\u2019s developer marketing for cross-platform \u2013\nwhat it says as opposed to what it does \u2013 is more focused on .NET MAUI.\n\nAI coding: Hugging Face engineer extols benefits of open source models, but\nhard questions remain\n\nMeta based its Threads on Instagram to ship it quickly \u2013 and now has to unpick\nit\n\nVS Code updated with test coverage API, fixed floating windows, TypeScript 5.4\nand more\n\nQt 6.7 and Qt Creator 13 released with variable fonts, improved C++20 support,\nand more\n\nCloudflare updates Workers platform with Python support, event notifications,\nand improved local dev...\n\nBun 1.1 released with Windows support, stable WebSocket client and more\n\nAngular previews new features, Google aims to merge it with internal Wiz\nframework\n\nAtlassian takes another step toward full DevOps automation\n\nPodman 5.0 released with native Mac hypervisor support, new features and\nbreaking changes\n\n.NET Smart Components experiment the \"Visual Basic\" of AI programming?\n\nGitHub autofix progresses to public beta: insecure code corrected with AI, but\nonly for enterprise\n\nMicrosoft defends .NET 9's fresh feature against accusations of disrupting\nopen source ecosystem\n\nDevClassDeveloper News\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development\nissues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing\nand MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: devclass@sitpub.com\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\nLinkedin\n\nRSS\n\nTwitter\n\nYoutube\n\n\u00a9 Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n  * About\n  * Contribute\n  * Contact\n  * Sales\n  * Privacy\n  * Cookies\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n\n# DevClass asks for your consent to use your personal data to:\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 144 TCF vendor(s) and 78 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
