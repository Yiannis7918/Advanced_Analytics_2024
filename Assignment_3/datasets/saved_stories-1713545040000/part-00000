Achieve reactivity by using reactivity adapters. We provide pre-\nbuilt adapters for numerous libraries including Angular, Solid.js, Preact,\nVue, and others!\n\n## MongoDB-like interface\n\nYou don't have to learn new things. The API of SignalDB is similar to that of\nMongoDB. Thanks to the awesome mingo library, you can use your common\nselectors.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nSignalDB is built from ground up with TypeScript to provide you type safeness\nwhile you develop.\n\n\ud83d\udd35\n\n## simple\n\nSignalDB's schema-less design and in-memory storage significantly enhance the\nDeveloper Experience by simplifying data management and ensuring rapid query\nperformance.\n\n## Solid.js\n\nSolid.js's granular reactivity and efficient data management provide a robust\nfoundation for SignalDB, enabling the creation and management of signals which\nare core reactive primitives, thereby allowing for real-time data updates and\nsynchronization.\n\n## React\n\nSignalDB's reactivity adapters allow for seamless integration with signal\nlibraries, enabling auto-updates to reactive queries whenever data changes,\nwhich aligns well with React's reactivity model.\n\n## Vue\n\nVue.js's powerful reactivity system, which allows for effortless binding and\nupdating of the UI based on data changes, pairs well with SignalDB's\nreactivity adapters, creating a fusion of two reactivity paradigms and\nensuring real-time data accuracy.\n\n\ud83e\udd73\n\n## and many more!\n\nSignalDB is designed to be framework-agnostic, offering integration through\nreactivity adapters which allow it to seamlessly interface with various signal\nlibraries, ensuring auto-updates to reactive queries when data changes; this\nflexibility makes it a great choice for integration with a wide range of\nframeworks\n\nReleased under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023-present Max Nowack\n\n", "frontpage": false}
