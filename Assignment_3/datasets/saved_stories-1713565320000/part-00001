No,\nseriously. In programming circles, this is a big deal. A developer had\nproposed replacing a tab with a space character to help Kconfig parsers read\nfiles. No, sorry, that was a bad move.\n\nAlso: Don't like your Linux desktop? Here's how to install an alternative\n\nAs Torvalds explained, Kconfig adds hidden tabs on purpose to catch mistakes\nin kernel config parsing tools. Now you and that developer know.\n\nMoving to issues that matter more to mortal users than kernel programmers,\nTorvalds was happy to report that all is \"calm and steady and boring\" with the\nforthcoming Linux 6.9 kernel release. That's as it should be with an\nover-30-year-old software project. If something is exciting, then that\nprobably means something's gone wrong.\n\nThis led to a conversation about the ongoing problem with hardware errors,\nwhich can lead to security issues. It's frustrating, said Torvalds, \"because\nwe can often react quite quickly in software, but then the hardware people are\nsaying, 'Oh, we have five generations of hardware that we can't fix after the\nfact, and it will take another couple of years before the actual new hardware\n[arrives] that can help you work around the problem.'\"\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Tech Today\n\nZDNET's Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked\nabout stories, five days a week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\nWith the rise of open hardware such as RISC-V, you might think that wouldn't\nbe a problem for new generations of hardware. Not so, said Torvalds.\n\n\"My fear,\" confessed Torvalds, \"Is that RISC-V will make all the same mistakes\nthat everybody else did before them.\" Why? Well, first, \"hardware people are\ndifferent from software people. There's a fairly big gulf between them.\" In\naddition, hardware developers reinvent old ways of doing things and only learn\nby making all the same mistakes that have been made before. It's sad, but\ntrue.\n\nAlso: 5 reasons why desktop Linux is finally growing in popularity\n\nStill, he expects things to go faster this time. As Hohndel also pointed out,\nLinux has gotten better at smoothing out the differences between hardware\nplatforms for users. \"Ten years ago, moving away from x86 to a different\nplatform was still incredibly hard,\" Hohndel said. \"Today, most people don't\neven know whether you're running on an AMD or an Intel chip. It's in the\ncloud, and everything looks exactly the same.\"\n\nOne problem that some open-source projects have encountered recently is\nvillainous developers who resemble normal, helpful ones but are in fact\nmalicious. The tiny Linux XZ Util program had a security backdoor placed\nwithin it that came within a cat's whisker of spreading into mainstream Linux\ndistributions.\n\nAlso: XZ Utils might not have been the only sabotage target, open-source\nfoundations warn\n\nIt was stopped in time, and it wasn't a Linux problem, but it's still\nworrisome. As Torvalds recalled, \"There was an attempt in 2021 by graduate\nstudents to push bad patches into Linux. They failed, and that didn't end well\nfor them. Linux's maintainers caught the bad patches and were really upset\nabout it. It ended up being a very personal matter, and our maintainers were\nvery pissed off about it.\"\n\nBut the Linux community is unique. It has over a thousand developers, many of\nwhom have worked together for decades. A hacker trying to trick his way into\nplanting bad code into the kernel faces an almost impossible task. That's not\nthe case, though, with most programs.\n\nEven so, Torvalds pointed out, \"When the bad actor finally took advantage of\nbecoming a maintainer, it was found within weeks. That open-source projects\nhave found these kinds of attacks implies a fairly strong amount of stability\nso that these things do get caught. A healthy community is the best defense.\"\n\nAlas, that doesn't translate for 99% of open-source projects, which tend to be\ntiny. Torvalds continued: \"It's a wake-up call.\" We need to know whom we can\ntrust. In the kernel, Torvalds said, we have PGP [Pretty Good Privacy] as the\nfoundation for a network of trust. \"But, I think we're going to see a lot of\nwork being put into some kind of trust model where people say, 'Oh, this is a\nnew person,' or 'This is a person that is acting differently from usual.'\"\n\nAlso: Do you need antivirus on Linux?\n\nHohndel agreed but added that the industry needs to support these smaller\nprojects -- and not only with money. \"Companies need to engage with these\nprojects. Have your company adopt a couple of such projects and just\nparticipate. Read the code, review the patches, and provide moral support to\nthe maintainers. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nAnd don't expect AI to be the answer.\n\nNeither of these senior open-source leaders buy into AI hype. Torvalds\nsnarked, \"It's hilarious to watch. Maybe I'll be replaced by an AI model!\" As\nfor Hohndel, he thinks most AI today is \"autocorrect on steroids.\"\n\nTorvalds summed up his attitude as, \"Let's wait 10 years and see where it\nactually goes before we make all these crazy announcements.\"\n\nThat's not to say the two men don't think AI will be helpful in the future.\nIndeed, Torvalds noted one good side effect already: \"NVIDIA has gotten better\nat talking to Linux kernel developers and working with Linux memory\nmanagement,\" because of its need for Linux to run AI's large language models\n(LLMs) efficiently.\n\nTorvalds is also \"looking forward to the tools actually to find bugs. We have\na lot of tools, and we use them religiously, but making the tools smarter is\nnot a bad thing. Using smarter tools is just the next inevitable step. We have\ntools that do kernel rewriting, with very complicated scripts, and pattern\nrecognition. AI can be a huge help here because some of these tools are very\nhard to use because you have to specify things at a low enough level.\"\n\nAlso: The best Linux laptops\n\nJust be careful, Torvalds warns of \"AI BS.\" Hohndel quickly quipped, \"He meant\nbeautiful science. You know, \"Beautiful science in, beautiful science out.\"\n\nI think Torvalds meant something else.\n\nHohndel's final question was whether Torvalds saw himself doing another big\nproject after Linux and Git. Torvalds hopes not.\n\nHe replied, \"I hope it never happens. I say that because every single project\nI've started has always started from me being frustrated with other people\nbeing incompetent or money-grabbing. The reason I started Linux was that I\ncouldn't afford the real thing. And I said, 'How hard can it be?' The answer\nis it can be pretty hard because here I am, 33 years later, and I'm still\nworking on it.\"\n\nAlso: RebornOS is a beautiful, user-friendly take on Arch Linux\n\nThen, Torvalds continued, \"I made the same mistake 20 years ago when I said,\n'Hey, I really don't think source control management is very interesting, but\nall these people before me -- they clearly got it completely wrong. So I need\nto do my own. How hard can it be?' So, I'm hoping never to be in that\nsituation again.\"\n\nTorvalds continues to work on Linux and Git today because \"others came around\nand said, 'Hey, I need this.' Without them, I would not have continued. So\nwhile my products start with something that I need, the things that actually\nkeep them going is that they're actually useful to other people.\"\n\nSo, as long as we find Linux useful, Torvalds and company will continue to\nwork on and improve it.\n\n#### Open Source\n\n5 Linux commands you must know to keep your device running smoothly\n\nThe best Linux laptops you can buy: Expert tested\n\nThe best Linux distros for beginners\n\nGerman state ditches Microsoft for Linux and LibreOffice\n\nMy 5 favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one)\n\n  * 5 Linux commands you must know to keep your device running smoothly\n\n  * The best Linux laptops you can buy: Expert tested\n\n  * The best Linux distros for beginners\n\n  * German state ditches Microsoft for Linux and LibreOffice\n\n  * My 5 favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one)\n\nEditorial standards\n\nShow Comments\n\nLog In to Comment Community Guidelines\n\nx\n\nplayer version| 3.2.1  \n---|---  \nplayback state| -1  \ntransition state| start  \n  \n00:00 00:00 Live\n\nLearn More\n\n### Related\n\n### Nvidia-powered AI supercomputer gives students the same tools as big tech\nengineers\n\n### Humane Ai Pin: What went wrong and how it can be fixed (before it's too\nlate)\n\n### This backdoor almost infected Linux everywhere: The XZ Utils close call\n\nZDNET\n\nwe equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at\nhome.\n\n  * Topics\n  * Galleries\n  * Videos\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n  * about ZDNET\n  * Meet The Team\n  * Sitemap\n  * Reprint Policy\n\n  * Join\n\n|\n\nLog In\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Site Assistance\n  * Licensing\n\n\u00a9 2024 ZDNET, A Red Ventures company.
