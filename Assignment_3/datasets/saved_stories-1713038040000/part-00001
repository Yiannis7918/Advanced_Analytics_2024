Tiongson\n\nApril 10, 2024 at 10:31 AM UTC\n\nThe world is going through a demographic transition\u2013and it could mean a tight\nlabor market for the foreseeable future.\n\nJustin Sullivan - Getty Images\n\nJob vacancies have stayed high or have been rising in various parts of the\nworld, despite slower global growth and tighter credit markets. Countries\naround the world have taken measures to address these unusual worker\nshortages\u2013but piecemeal solutions overlook the transformation of the global\nlabor market, the fundamental ways it has changed since the pandemic, and the\nconsequences of the demographic transition worldwide.\n\nGlobal growth has slowed since 2022, as various shocks and conflicts have\ndamaged and continue to threaten the global economy. With tighter credit\nconditions everywhere and businesses still reeling from inflation,\nunemployment is projected to rise steadily in the coming years.\n\nYet the number of job vacancies\u2013unoccupied roles businesses are eager to\nfill\u2013remains surprisingly high or even close to record highs in various parts\nof the world. Even in the markets where job vacancies have been trending down\nin recent months\u2013such as in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Singapore, the U.K.,\nand the U.S.\u2013they remain unusually high and above their pre-pandemic average.\nElsewhere, for example in Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania,\nand Spain, they have stayed high or have been rising.\n\nThe real number of vacancies could be even higher if we consider that firms\nmay be discouraged from posting new vacancies, having previously failed to\nfind qualified workers. In Germany, although the number of registered\nvacancies is about 700,000, the government estimates that the real number is\ncloser to 2 million.\n\nThe mismatch between the skills that workers have and what employers need\npresents a significant barrier to filling job vacancies. The reality is stark:\nWhile the job market burgeons with opportunities, a mismatch in skills leaves\nmany positions unfilled, even in the face of high or rising unemployment.\n\n## A skills shortage\n\nIn Ontario, Canada, the manufacturing sector is struggling to fill the roles,\nwith over 18,900 vacant positions and an impending influx of more than 7,000\njobs in the electric vehicle sector looming over the next two years. At the\nend of 2022, Australia encountered a similar scenario, with job vacancies\nsurpassing the count of unemployed individuals. In Singapore, the post-\npandemic labor market is characterized by a mismatch between the jobs\navailable and the skills of the workforce, resulting in 1.6 job vacancies for\nevery unemployed individual. Across Europe, the longstanding struggle to find\nenough skilled workers in the construction sector has been exacerbated by a\nsurge in demand following the pandemic, signaling a broader, global challenge.\n\nFortune\n\nThe acute shortage of skilled labor is now seen as a barrier to economic\ngrowth. In Germany, economic growth prospects are now at 0.7%\u2013far below its\nlong-term average of 2%\u2013partly due to a worker shortage. Businesses eager to\ngrow and capitalize on new market opportunities find themselves hamstrung by\nthe difficulty of sourcing workers with the right skills. This gap between\navailable jobs and the skills of job seekers not only underscores the\ninefficiencies in current workforce development strategies but also highlights\nan urgent need for educational and vocational training programs to pivot.\nIndustry representatives across countries have argued such programs must now\nevolve swiftly to match the demands of a rapidly changing marketplace, one\nwhere the push for low-carbon technologies and the pace of digitalization are\naccelerating the demand for new, specialized skills.\n\n## The scramble for solutions\n\nThe rise in job vacancies and worker shortages reflects several underlying\ntrends. After a downturn in 2020, the global economy saw a robust rebound,\nsurging by 6.3% in 2021 and 3.4% in 2022, which, in turn, spurred an uptick in\njob postings. The second piece of the puzzle could be related to reduced\nimmigration flows due to COVID-19. The pandemic prompted many workers to leave\ntheir host countries, while immigration systems grappled with delays in visa\nprocessing, creating worker gaps as a result. Third, wage stagnation has been\na persistent issue. For instance, in Australia, even as wages have seen some\nincrease, they have failed to match the rising cost of living. Finally,\nspecific national circumstances also play a role, such as the U.K.\u2019s labor\nmarket challenges post-Brexit.\n\nIn response, governments have started taking steps to recruit more immigrant\nworkers or formalize their status. At the end of last year, Greece approved\nnew legislation granting thousands of undocumented migrants residence rights,\nprovided they secure employment. Top officials in Germany have gone so far as\nto admit that the country could not close its widening workforce gap without\nmigrant labor. Berlin has implemented several legislative changes aimed at\nmaking Germany more appealing to migrant workers, including simplifying the\npath to citizenship, accelerating visa processing, and recognizing foreign\nqualifications in the job market. More countries may follow suit.\n\nNew work arrangements, such as a four-day workweek, are also being explored.\nIn Germany, since February, dozens of companies have been piloting a four-day\nworkweek. The idea is that a shorter workweek could ultimately make workers\nmore motivated and productive, helping ease labor shortages in the process.\nOther European countries are running similar trials. Meanwhile, in at least\none German city, public companies are hiring students to help alleviate the\nshortage of workers. Remarkably, some U.S. states have been considering easing\nchild labor laws and allowing more teenagers to be hired by establishments\nbecause migration policy is thought to be more controversial.\n\n## A global demographic transition\n\nIn the meantime, an economic slowdown could temporarily conceal the underlying\ntrend of increasing job vacancies. Take the U.K., where the ongoing economic\ncontraction is simultaneously driving up unemployment rates and diminishing\nthe number of available positions. Similarly, in Denmark, the recession\ntowards the end of 2023 appears to have contributed to a decrease in job\nopenings. As these economies eventually rebound, we are likely to see a\nresurgence of labor shortages and vacancies.\n\nHowever, piecemeal measures alone will not solve the issue, as a longer-term\ndemographic transition is unfolding worldwide. Across advanced economies,\nunfilled vacancies are set to rise due to aging populations. Official\nestimates suggest Germany\u2019s aging society will be short seven million skilled\nworkers by 2035. Japan\u2019s working-age population peaked in 1998, and the\nnumbers have been on a steady decline ever since. The U.S. stands on the\nprecipice of a job surge, with forecasts promising 11.9 million new roles by\n2030, yet the domestic labor force is on track to fall short by 3 million,\neven as the economy clamors for workers.\n\nPopulations worldwide are aging quickly, a trend not spared even among\ntraditional labor-sending and lower-income countries, with Africa being the\nlone exception. This reality indicates that more open migration policies aimed\nat these traditional sending countries\u2013a significant policy shift virtually\nunattainable in the current political landscape\u2013would not suffice. Countries\nin Central America now have fertility rates below replacement, echoing the\nconcern that many migrant countries of origin and lower-income countries will\nbe \u201cold before they get rich.\u201d While facilitating access for African migrant\nworkers to high-income labor markets will be important, equally vital is the\ninvestment in their education and training, ensuring that African workers make\nfull use of opportunities overseas.\n\n## A workforce in crisis\n\nIn addition to an aging world, the Great Resignation was real, with many\nworkers having left the workforce since the pandemic. In the U.S., an\nunprecedented 50 million workers stepped down in 2021 and 2022, reflecting a\ngrowing dissatisfaction with work following the COVID-19 pandemic. Although\ninitially perceived as predominantly an American trend, the data suggest that\nthis general dissatisfaction has spread to other parts of the world. France\nwitnessed a record 2.7 million voluntary resignations in 2022, with similar\ntrends observed across Europe, though Asia saw a decline in resignations. In\nAustralia, there are growing signs of similar worker discontent. And even in\nthe U.S. where quit rates have recently fallen, certain industries like\npersonal care services continue to report higher-than-average resignation\nrates.\n\nThe labor shortages we observe can partly be traced back to the devastating\nimpact of COVID-19, including the lingering effects of long COVID. In the\nU.S., the workforce has not only mourned the loss of over a quarter-million\nworking-age individuals to the virus but has also seen a lasting reduction,\nwith a figure more than twice as large across various age groups withdrawing\nfrom employment. Particularly affected were migrant communities, which\nsuffered higher COVID-19 mortality rates, further exacerbating the decrease in\navailable migrant labor.\n\nFollowing the pandemic, a pronounced shift in work preferences has emerged,\nwith a growing demand for reduced hours, enhanced flexibility, and better\nwork-life balance. In the U.S., a substantial number of employees, for whom\nresignation isn\u2019t a viable choice, have voiced a clear preference for more\nflexible working conditions, remote opportunities, and improved work-life\nbalance\u2013an enduring legacy of the pandemic\u2019s impact on workplace norms. In\nSingapore, workers are willing to trade off pay for flexibility. As a result,\nthis trend, particularly among younger workers, higher earners, and women, has\nled to a reduction in working hours in the U.S., further exacerbating labor\nshortages.\n\nThe surge in vacancies isn\u2019t just an anomaly\u2013it signals a profound\ntransformation sweeping across global labor markets. This shift encompasses\nnot only the demographic transition but also the changes in work preferences\npost-pandemic.\n\nExisting solutions may offer brief relief, and economic downturns could hide\nthese challenges temporarily, but ultimately, the resolution will require\nglobal coordination unlike we have seen before. It\u2019s time for daring, creative\napproaches to mobilize diverse labor pools: harnessing Africa\u2019s rapidly\ngrowing working-age population, tapping into the underutilized potential of\nolder but still productive workers from lower-income countries, and re-\nengaging the retirees and dissatisfied younger workers of wealthier countries.\n\nRecognizing the interconnectedness of the challenges before us is crucial. We\nare part of a singular, global labor market. The problems we face are shared,\nand so must be the solutions we will figure out, together.\n\nMigl\u0117 Petrauskait\u0117 is an ODI Fellow serving as Senior Economist at Uganda\u2019s\nMinistry of Finance.\n\nErwin R.
