Those are the findings of a new study conducted by\nCharit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin and published in the journal Science.*\nThe study found that human neurons communicate in one direction, while in\nmice, signals tend to flow in loops. This increases the efficiency and\ncapacity of the human brain to process information. These discoveries could\nfurther the development of artificial neural networks.\n\nThe neocortex, a critical structure for human intelligence, is less than five\nmillimeters thick. There, in the outermost layer of the brain, 20 billion\nneurons process countless sensory perceptions, plan actions, and form the\nbasis of our consciousness. How do these neurons process all this complex\ninformation? That largely depends on how they are \u201cwired\u201d to each other.\n\nMore complex neocortex \u2013 different information processing\n\n\u201cOur previous understanding of neural architecture in the neocortex is based\nprimarily on findings from animal models such as mice,\u201d explains Prof. J\u00f6rg\nGeiger, Director of the Institute for Neurophysiology at Charit\u00e9. In those\nmodels, the neighboring neurons frequently communicate with each other as if\nthey are in dialogue. One neuron signals another, and then that one sends a\nsignal back. That means the information often flows in recurrent loops.\u201d\n\nThe human neocortex is much thicker and more complex than that of a mouse.\nNonetheless, researchers had previously assumed \u2013 in part due to lack of data\n\u2013 that it follows the same basic principles of connectivity. A team of Charit\u00e9\nresearchers led by Geiger has now used exceptionally rare tissue samples and\nstate-of-the-art technology to demonstrate that this is not the case.\n\nA clever method of listening in on neuronal communication\n\nFor the study, the researchers examined brain tissue from 23 people who had\nundergone neurosurgery at Charit\u00e9 to treat drug-resistant epilepsy. During\nsurgery, it was medically necessary to remove brain tissue in order to gain\naccess to the diseased structures beneath it. The patients had consented to\nthe use of this access tissue for research purposes.\n\nTo be able to observe the flows of signals between neighboring neurons in the\noutermost layer of the human neocortex, the team developed an improved version\nof what is known as the \u201cmultipatch\u201d technique. This allowed the researchers\nto listen in on the communications taking place between as many as ten neurons\nat once (for details, see \u201cAbout the method\u201d). As a result, they were able to\ntake the necessary number of measurements to map the network in the short time\nbefore the cells ceased their activity outside the body. In all, they analyzed\nthe communication channels among nearly 1,170 neurons with about 7,200\npossible connections.\n\nFeed-forward instead of in cycles\n\nThey found that only a small fraction of the neurons engaged in reciprocal\ndialogue with each other. \u201cIn humans, the information tends to flow in one\ndirection instead. It seldom returns to the starting point either directly or\nvia cycles,\u201d explains Dr. Yangfan Peng, first author of the publication. He\nworked on the study at the Institute for Neurophysiology and is now based at\nthe Department of Neurology and the Neuroscience Research Center at Charit\u00e9.\nThe team used a computer simulation that they devised according to the same\nprinciples underlying the human network architecture to demonstrate that this\nforward-directed signal flow has benefits in terms of processing data.\n\nThe researchers gave the artificial neural network a typical machine learning\ntask: recognizing the correct numbers from audio recordings of spoken digits.\nThe network model that mimicked the human structures achieved more correct\nresponses to this speech recognition task than the one modeled on mice. It was\nalso more efficient, with the same performance requiring the equivalent of 380\nneurons in the mouse model, but only 150 in the human one.\n\nAn economic role model for AI?\n\n\u201cThe directed network architecture we see in humans is more powerful and\nconserves resources because more independent neurons can handle different\ntasks simultaneously,\u201d Peng explains. \u201cThis means that the local network can\nstore more information. It isn\u2019t clear yet whether our findings within the\noutermost layer of the temporal cortex extend to other cortical regions, or\nhow well they might explain the unique cognitive abilities of humans.\u201d\n\nIn the past, AI developers have looked to biological models for inspiration in\ndesigning artificial neural networks, but have also optimized their algorithms\nindependently of the biological models. \u201cMany artificial neural networks\nalready use some form of this forward-directed connectivity because it\ndelivers better results for some tasks,\u201d Geiger says. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to see\nthat the human brain also shows similar network principles. These insights\ninto cost-efficient information processing in the human neocortex could\nprovide further inspiration for refining AI networks.\u201d\n\n*Peng Y et al.

Under the leadership of the\nInstitute of Neurophysiology, the following were involved: the Department of\nNeurosurgery, the Department of Neurology with Experimental Neurology, the\nInstitute of Integrative Neuroanatomy, the Department of Neuropathology, the\nNeuroscience Research Center, and the NeuroCure Cluster of Excellence, with\nsupport from the University Clinic for Neurosurgery at Evangelisches Klinikum\nBethel and the Institute of Neuroinformatics at ETH Zurich.\n\nAbout the method When surgery is performed to treat drug-resistant, or\nrefractory, epilepsy, it is often medically necessary to remove brain tissue.\nThe explicit consent of patients was required in order to examine this\nvaluable tissue for the study that has just been published. The research group\nis profoundly grateful to the patients for their consent. The authors used\nwhat is known as the \u201cpatch-clamp\u201d method to analyze synaptic communication\nbetween neurons. In this technique, an ultra-thin glass pipette is attached to\na single neuron under a microscope to measure or stimulate the cell\u2019s\nelectrical activity. The study utilized an advanced form of this technique in\nwhich multiple of these micropipettes simultaneously record the activity and\nconnectivity of up to ten neurons (the \u201cmultipatch\u201d method). To be able to\nposition the pipettes precisely, the device is equipped with robot arms that\nenable movements in the nanometer range. The measurement process is highly\nchallenging and labor-intensive. Using two devices in parallel allowed the\nteam to study several hundred connections between the nerve cells for each\ntissue sample. The brain tissue can be preserved for up to two days outside\nthe body in an artificial nutrient solution before activity ceases.\n\n## Downloads\n\nImage 1: Reconstruction neuronal network \u00a9 Charit\u00e9 | Sabine Grosser\n\n523 KB\n\nImage 2: Experimental set-up \u00a9 Charit\u00e9 | Yangfan Peng\n\n8.95 MB\n\nImage 3: Close-up experimental set-up \u00a9 Charit\u00e9 | Yangfan Peng\n\n6.13 MB\n\nVideo 1 \u00a9 Charit\u00e9 | Yangfan Peng\n\n12.88 MB\n\nMulti-patch device with robot manipulators that automatically rinse the glass\npipettes between two rounds of experiments\n\nVideo 2 \u00a9 Charit\u00e9 | Franz Mittermaier\n\n9.74 MB\n\nA micropipette from the multipatch device approaches an individual neuron\n\nVideo 3 \u00a9 Charit\u00e9 | Sabine Grosser\n\n28 MB\n\nRotating reconstruction of neurons\n\n## Links\n\nOriginal publication\n\nInstitute of Neurphysiology\n\n## Contact\n\nDr. Yangfan Peng Department of Neurology with Experimental Neurology\nNeuroscience Research Center Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin T: +49 30\n450 539 145\n\nBack to Overview\n\nCharit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin | Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte | Charit\u00e9platz 1 | D 10117 Berlin | t: +49 30 450 - 50 | www.charite.de | \u00a9 2024 Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin\n\nCharit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin\n\n\u00a9 2024 Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin\n\n", "frontpage": false}
