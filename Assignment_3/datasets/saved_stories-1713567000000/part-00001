Every year, millions of tons of plastic enter the oceans\nprimarily from rivers. The plastic afloat across the oceans \u2013 legacy plastic \u2013\nisn\u2019t going away by itself. Therefore, solving ocean plastic pollution\nrequires a combination of stemming the inflow and cleaning up what has already\naccumulated. The Ocean Cleanup is developing cleanup systems to clean up what\nis already polluting our oceans and to intercept plastic on its way to the\nocean via rivers. When we have achieved our goal of a 90% reduction in ocean\nplastic, our project is finished and our work will be done.
