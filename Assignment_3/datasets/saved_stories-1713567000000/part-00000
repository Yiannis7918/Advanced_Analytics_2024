His\nfather Baha' Walad was descended from the first caliph Abu Bakr and was\ninfluenced by the ideas of Ahmad Ghazali, brother of the famous philosopher.\nBaha' Walad's sermons were published and still exist as Divine Sciences\n(Ma'arif). He fled the Mongols with his son in 1219, and it was reported that\nat Nishapur young Rumi met 'Attar, who gave him a copy of his Book of\nMysteries (Asrar-nama). After a pilgrimage to Mecca and other travels, the\nfamily went to Rum (Anatolia). Baha' Walad was given an important teaching\nposition in the capital at Konya (Iconium) in 1228 by Seljuk king 'Ala' al-Din\nKayqubad (r. 1219-1236) and his vizier Mu'in al-Din. Rumi married and had a\nson, who later wrote his biography. In 1231 Rumi succeeded his late father as\na religious teacher. His father's friend Burhan al-Din arrived and for nine\nyears taught Rumi Sufism. Rumi probably met the philosopher ibn al-Arabi at\nDamascus.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nBrowse all Famous poems > By Mewlana Jalaluddin Rumi\n\n74.9k views +list\n\nShare it with your friends:\n\nMake comments, explore modern poetry.
