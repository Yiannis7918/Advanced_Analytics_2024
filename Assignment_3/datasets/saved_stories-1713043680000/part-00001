It was unassuming compared with the video- and photo-based artworks in\nthe adjacent rooms, but only on closer inspection might visitors have wondered\nwhy there was no label giving the artist or the work\u2019s title.\n\nThe real reason only became public last week: the nameless painting, the\ncontent of which has not been previously made public, was not the work of a\nmodern master selected by the curators, but the creation of a 51-year-old\ntechnical worker employed by the museum, who had sneaked it into the show in\nthe early hours of the morning.\n\nThe Pinakothek, which has one of Europe\u2019s largest collections of modern and\ncontemporary art, removed the painting after closing time, sacked the\ntechnician and kept quiet about the incident.\n\nMunich\u2019s Pinakothek der Moderne museum has a major collection of contemporary\nart. Photograph: FocusCulture/Alamy\n\nWhen news of the stunt found its way to the German press via a police report\nlast Monday, the museum downplayed it. \u201cA little hoax, a trifling matter,\u201d a\nspokesperson said. A first report in S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper framed the\nincident as a wannabe-artist seeking an \u201cartistic breakthrough\u201d by putting\nhimself in the company of Andy Warhol, Joseph Beuys and others.\n\nBut museum insiders say that far from being a brazen shot at fame, the artwork\nwas meant as a critical intervention by one of the people who help make\nexhibitions happen but usually remain invisible, designed to provoke debate\nabout elitism in the art world.\n\nEarly reports failed to mention that the special exhibition in which the\npicture was hung was all about errors and malfunctions in art, and called\nGlitch: On the Art of Interference.\n\nIts aim, according to the catalogue, was to \u201cuncover normative orders and\nsociopolitical disparities\u201d and \u201cmake visible what is invisible\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe motive behind smuggling that picture into the exhibition was to see if\nthe directors of the museum were prepared to practise what they preach\u201d, said\none person familiar with the events. \u201cIt was an artistic challenge. The\ntechnician who hung up the picture wasn\u2019t lusting for fame.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Observed\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news, culture and stories brought to you by\nthe best Observer writers\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

It said the technician, who worked part-time at the museum,\nhad been barred from all Bavarian State Painting Collections galleries for\nthree years and had signed a \u201cdissolution agreement\u201d. These nullify an\nemployee\u2019s contract, but often also contain confidentiality clauses.\n\nSo far, the technician-artist has neither been named nor commented on the\naffair. A spokesperson for the Pinakothek last week declined to either name\nthe employee nor describe his picture, for fear of \u201cencouraging copycat\npranksters\u201d.\n\nIn a statement later in the week, the museum rejected the idea that hanging\nthe picture was an \u201cartistic intervention\u201d, because no hurdles had been\novercome; it was merely a breach of trust.\n\n\u201cEmployees must comply with security concepts and not jeopardise valuable\ncultural heritage,\u201d it added. A criminal complaint against the technician for\ndamage to property was withdrawn in March.\n\nThe Pinakothek did not respond when asked if its dealings with the affair were\nat odds with the message of its exhibition.\n\nCurators of an exhibition in Bonn last year took a very different approach.\nWhen taking down a temporary exhibition entitled Who We Are \u2013 Reflecting a\nCountry of Immigration, they were surprised to find an extra painting on their\nhands. They put out a message on social media saying: \u201cWe think this is funny\nand would like to know the artist. So get in touch! There will be no trouble.\nWord of honour.\u201d\n\nThe artist, Danai Emmanouilidis, came forward and saw her painting fetch\n\u20ac3,696 at auction in Cologne.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Germany\n  * The Observer\n  * Art\n  * Painting\n  * Museums\n  * Europe\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
