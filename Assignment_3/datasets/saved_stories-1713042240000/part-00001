All of the pets had skin and soft tissue\ninfections (SSTI) or urinary tract infections (UTI).\n\nIn Portugal, one dog (1/43 pets, 2.3%) was colonized by an OXA-181-producing\nmultidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strain. OXA-181 is an enzyme that confers\nresistance to carbapenems.\n\nThree cats and 21 dogs (24/43 pets, 55.8%) and 28 owners (28/78 owners, 35.9%)\nharbored ESBL/Amp-C producing Enterobacterales. These are resistant to third\ngeneration cephalosporins.\n\nIn five households, one home with a cat and four with dogs, both pet and owner\nwere carrying ESBL/AmpC-producing bacteria. Genetic analysis showed the\nstrains to be the same, indicating that the bacteria passed between pet and\nowner.\n\nIn one of these five households, a dog and owner also had the same strain of\nantibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae.\n\nIn the UK, one dog (1/22 pets,14.3%) was colonized by two strains of\nmultidrug-resistant E. coli producing NDM-5 beta-lactamase. These E. coli were\nresistant to third generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and several other\nfamilies of antibiotics.\n\nESBL/AmpC-producing Enterobacterales were isolated from eight dogs (8/22 pets,\n36.4%) and three owners (3/24 owners, 12.5%).\n\nIn two households, both dog and owner were carrying the same ESBL/AmpC-\nproducing bacteria.\n\nIt wasn't possible to prove the direction of transmission, however, in three\nof the homes in Portugal, the timing of the positive tests for the ESBL/AmpC-\nproducing bacteria strongly suggest that, in these cases at least, the\nbacteria were being passed from pet (two dogs and one cat) to human.\n\nMenezes, a Ph.D. student, says, \"Our findings underline the importance of\nincluding pet-owning households in national programs that monitor levels of\nantibiotic resistance.\n\n\"Learning more about the resistance in pets would aid in the development of\ninformed and targeted interventions to safeguard both animal and human\nhealth.\"\n\nBacteria can be passed between pets and humans by petting, touching or kissing\nand through the handling of feces. To prevent transmission, the researchers\nrecommend owners practice good hygiene, including washing their hands after\npetting their dog or cat and after handling their waste.\n\n\"When your pet is unwell, consider isolating them in one room to prevent the\nspread of bacteria throughout the house and clean the other rooms thoroughly,\"\nadds Menezes.\n\nAll of the dogs and cats were successfully treated for their infections. The\nowners did not have infections and so did not need treatment.\n\nProvided by European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases\n\nCitation: UK and Portuguese study strongly suggests 'superbugs' are being\npassed from pets to owners (2024, April 12) retrieved 13 April 2024 from\nhttps://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-04-uk-portuguese-strongly-superbugs-\npets.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
