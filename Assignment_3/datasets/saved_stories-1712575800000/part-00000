The\nlifespan retrieval curve contains three different parts.^[2] From birth to\nfive years old is a period of childhood amnesia, from 15 to 25 years old is\nthe reminiscence bump and last is a period of forgetting from the end of the\nreminiscence bump to present time.^[2] The reminiscence bump has been observed\non the lifespan retrieval curve in multiple studies.\n\nTheorists have proposed several explanations, ranging from changes in brain\nbiology to the type of events that typically occur during this time period.\nResearchers have consistently observed the reminiscence bump, the period of\nincreased memory accessibility in participants' lifespan retrieval curves, and\nthe bump has been reproduced under a range of study conditions.\n\n## Theories[edit]\n\nAdolescence and early adulthood have been described as important times in\nmemory encoding because individuals typically recall a disproportionate number\nof autobiographical memories from those periods.^[3]^[4] The reminiscence bump\naccounts for this disproportionate number of memories. The reminiscence bump\ntypically occurs between 10 years of age and 30 years of age and is the period\nthat individuals produce the most memories during free recall tasks.^[5]\nResearch suggests that memories are easily accessible from the reminiscence\nbump because they are linked to self-identity.^[6] The memories found within\nthe reminiscence bump significantly contribute to an individual's life goals,\nself-theories, attitudes, and beliefs.^[6] Additionally, life events that\noccur during the period of the reminiscence bump, such as graduation,\nmarriage, or the birth of a child, are often very novel, thus, making them\nmore memorable.^[2]\n\nThere are three possible hypotheses of the reminiscence bump: a cognitive\naccount, a narrative/identity account, and a biological/maturational\naccount.^[7]\n\nThe cognitive account suggests that memories are remembered best because they\noccur during a period of rapid change followed by a period of relative\nstability.^[3] There is an assumed memory advantage for the novel and distinct\nevents that is followed by a period of stability.^[7] The novel events are\nsubject to greater elaborative cognitive processing leading to stronger\nencoding of these memories. Moreover, the period of stability that follows\nincreases the stability of the cues for these memories and increases the\nchances of recall.^[7]\n\nThe narrative/identity account suggests that the reminiscence bump occurs\nbecause a sense of self-identity develops during adolescence and early\nadulthood.^[3] Research suggests that memories that have more influence and\nsignificance to one's self are more frequently rehearsed in defining one's\nidentity, and are therefore better remembered later in life (Ece & Gulgoz,\n2014). Self-identity formation provides added motivation for using cognitive\nprocesses to ensure recall of these memories.^[3] The events from this period\nare more likely to be organized into a story or view of oneself, and benefits\nfrom the advantage of schematic organization in memory.^[3]\n\nThe biological/maturational account suggests that genetic fitness is improved\nby having many memories that fall within the reminiscence bump.^[3] Cognitive\ncapacities are at their optimum from the ages of 10 to 30 and the reminiscence\nbump may reflect a peak in cognitive performance.^[4]^[8] This account is\ntherefore sometimes called the cognitive abilities account. Researchers have\nsuggested that the increase of cognitive ability in early adulthood may cause\nmemories during this time period to be more adequately stored (Ece & Gulgoz,\n2014). The reminiscence bump is caused by age-related differences in encoding\nefficiency, which cause more memories to be stored in adolescence and early\nadulthood.^[3]\n\nThere is one additional theory that explains the occurrence of the\nreminiscence bump: the life script account. A life script refers to the series\nof culturally important transitional events that are expected to occur in a\ncertain order at various points during the life span.^[9] During early\nadulthood one starts to make important decisions and have influencing\nexperiences on his or her identity. The memories during this time period are\ntherefore more significantly remembered because they are what has essentially\ndetermined and influenced their life script (Habernas & Bluck, 2000). A life\nscript typically has the majority of expected transitional experiences occur\nduring early adulthood (Gluck & Bluck, 2007), and usually includes positive\nexperiences such as marriage, the birth of a baby, or buying a house. Events\nthat deviate from the life script are typically sad and traumatic. These\nevents, such as the death of a child, are not culturally expected and often do\nnot show a peak of recall at any specific point during the life span.^[7] Life\nscripts act as a way to structure memory and lead to the expectation that the\nhappiest and the most important life events form the reminiscence bump.\nContrary to the recall of happy events, the recall of sad events remains\nstable across the life span and does not exhibit a bump in recall.^[7]\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n### Galton cue-word technique[edit]\n\nUsed objects from his environment to cue memories from his life.^[10] Galton\ncreated lists of cue-words to stimulate memory recall. He recorded the amount\nof time required to recall an autobiographical memory related to the cue- word\nand note the distribution of memories over the life span.^[10]\n\n### Crovitz-Schiffman cue-word technique[edit]\n\nMimicked Galton's technique and had participants recall and date\nautobiographical memories in response to the cue- words.^[10] Participants\nwere encouraged to share the first memory they thought of.^[1] This technique\nis consistent and reproducible under different conditions, such as using\ndifferent participants or cue- words. There is a consistent peak of recalled\nmemories within the reminiscence bump.^[1] However, different types of cue\nwords, such as nouns and adjectives, elicited memories from different time\nperiods and with different phenomenology.^[11]\n\n### Conway and Haque cue-word technique[edit]\n\nThese researchers presented cue-words in the form of common locations\n(restaurants, markets, parks), objects (chair, table, television), positive\nemotions (happy, joy, cheerful), negative emotions (frustration, pain, sad),\nand significant others (father, mother, friend).^[2] Participants were asked\nto retrieve a memory that reminded them of the cue- word, recall memories from\nacross their lifespan, and recall memories that were at least a year old. Then\nparticipants were asked to date the memory to the nearest month and year.^[2]\nThe results were graphed on a lifespan retrieval curve, and the reminiscence\nbump was observed.\n\n### Fluency tests[edit]\n\nHave participants indicate important personal events on a timeline.\nParticipants are given a timeline with intervals (e.g., 5 years per interval)\nand asked to fill in events that come to mind and indicate age during the\nevent.^[12] This gives the participant the ability to recall freely rather\nthan be limited to artificial cue- words. The time intervals focus the\nparticipant on certain periods and control the amount of time spent searching\nfor memories.^[12]\n\nParticipants are given a time period and asked to recall as many personal\nevents as possible from that period. It assesses the ability to generate both\npersonal semantic and personal incident memories.^[13] Recalling the personal\nsemantic memories, participants try to produce as many examples of name of\npeople known to them in a 90-second period.^[13] This is repeated for three\nlifetime periods: childhood, early adulthood, and recent adult life. Recalling\npersonal incident memories, participants try to produce as many personally\nexperienced events as possible in a 90-second period, and it is also repeated\nfor three lifetime periods.^[13]\n\n### Free recall method[edit]\n\nSubjects share personal events and researchers compare involuntary and\nvoluntary memories of young and older children. Participants read ten words\nand are asked to recall as many of the words as they can in no particular\norder. Then participants were asked to keep a diary on their memory process\nbetween two one-hour experimental sessions. They were asked to record\nautobiographical memories as soon as possible, using a two-page questionnaire\nfor each memory. Allowed researchers to keep track of personal thoughts and\nevents.^[14]\n\n### Twenty Statements Test (TST)[edit]\n\nParticipants provide 20 self-concepts that start with \"I am...\" This enables\nthe collection of concepts and roles that are important to the definition of\nself.^[5] There is no unitary structure to self, it is a combination of self-\nschemata such as \"I am a mother\". These self-concepts, or self-images, are\nthen used as autobiographical memory cues, enabling the distribution of highly\nself-relevant memories to be plotted across the lifespan.^[5]\n\n## Social and cultural influences[edit]\n\n### Literature, cinema, music and video games[edit]\n\nThe reminiscence bump can be observed in the distributions of people's\nfavorite books, movies, records and video games.^[15]^[16]^[17]^[18]^[19]\n\n### Generation identity[edit]\n\nGeneration identity occurs when an individual recognises that they are part of\na particular social subgroup, a cultural generation, and concern themselves\nwith the internalization of external features of the world.^[9] The\nreminiscence bump occurs during a period of life where people form their\nindividual and generational identity. The earlier years of the reminiscence\nbump coincide with the formation of generation identity, while the later years\ncoincide with the formation of adult identity.^[9]\n\nThe influence of generation identity on the reminiscence bump can be\nattributed to the idea that all members of the subgroup are likely to have\nmemories of similar types of experiences.^[9] Evidence attesting to the\ninfluence of generation identity on the reminiscence bump has been witnessed\nin populations that have experience with traumatic events. In 1999,\nresearchers compared younger and older groups of Bangladeshis. The younger\ngroup (ages 20\u201342) showed the usual increase in memories during the\nreminiscence bump while the older group (ages 46\u201386) showed a second increase\nin memories between the ages of 35 and 55. The second bump experienced by the\nolder group corresponded to the period of the Bangladesh Liberation War.^[2]\nThe two generations showed similar patterns and timing of memory recall within\ntheir own subgroup, suggesting that they did have similar experiences, either\nliving or not living through the war. This finding may suggests that each\ngeneration remember personal events and generational events.\n\n### Memory for public events and private events[edit]\n\nResearchers have studied different types of memories in order to find some\nclues into how the reminiscence bump works and how memories are stored and\nretrieved. Participants were asked to retrieve memories that were classified\nas either public or private to try to find differences in terms of when these\nmemories were stored.^[9] Public events are events that everyone living at the\ntime know about and are exposed to (political, war/murder,\nsports/entertainment or news events), but private events are only experienced\nby the individual (relationships, births/deaths, work/education, home/leisure,\nillness and religion).^[9] When recalling public events, participants were\nbetween ages 10 and 19; and when recalling private events, participants were\nbetween 20 and 29.^[9] Researchers suggest that public events are recalled at\nan earlier age because individuals are gaining a sense of generational\nidentity.^[20] People are starting to create their own beliefs and their\nindividual identity, so these experiences are being rehearsed, practiced and\nstored in long-term memory.^[9] Private events are recalled later because this\nis when individuals are developing intimate relationship.^[21] Private events\nare more easily stored and recalled because they are unique to each person and\nare likely occurring without any outside influence.^[9]\n\n### Gender differences[edit]\n\nStudies suggest gender differences in the reminiscence bump. Researchers found\nthat men have more positive life events in their thirties and that women have\nmore positive life events in their twenties.^[22] This finding suggests that\nthe timing of important positive life events, such as marriage or employment,\ndiffer for men and women.^[22] Most of the major life events start between the\nage of 15 and 30 but there is a small gender difference shown here with\nrespect to when the event takes place.^[22] Researchers found that women have\na slightly earlier bump than men. The earlier age of the bump in women may be\nattributed to earlier hormonal changes in adolescence.^[23]\n\n### Cross-cultural studies[edit]\n\nThe reminiscence bump has been studied cross-culturally and has been observed\nin various cultural backgrounds and experiences. It is important to consider\nthat the process of remembering occurs in the context of culture, and memories\nfound within the reminiscence bump are congruent with the culture's goals,\nvalues, and belief systems.^[24] The age of occurrence of the reminiscence\nbump is culturally influenced and reflects the age at which a culture\nidentifies individuals as adults. In Western societies the reminiscence bump\ncorresponds with adolescence and early adulthood, approximately from the ages\nof 10 to 30. In Asian cultures the reminiscence bump appears later than in\nWestern cultures because adulthood may not be reached until 30.^[6]\n\nCulture not only influences the age at which the reminiscence bump appears but\nalso the content of the memories found within the bump. Western cultures often\nvalue individuality, agency, and distinctiveness, where individuals are\nencouraged to develop and maintain their private beliefs, attitudes, and\npersonality traits. Alternatively, Asian cultures often value group\nsolidarity, communion, and interconnectedness, where individuals are\nencouraged to develop a sense of self that is aligned with social roles,\nduties, and responsibilities.^[24] The differences in societal norms expressed\nby Western and Asian cultures influence the focus of memories. Individuals\nfrom Western cultures have memories that cast the individual as the central\ncharacter and often have self-focused autobiographical memories. Individuals\nfrom Asian cultures have memories that express a strong group orientation and\noften have relation-centered autobiographical memories.^[6]\n\nA study done in 2005 showed more accurate age results that were dependent on\nculture and gender. American women and men showed reminiscence bumps at age 13\nand 17, respectively, while Dutch participants show a more progressive\ndevelopment of encoding strength around age 15.^[23] Studies with an identical\nmethodology found peaks in the same period with Polish^[25] and Japanese^[26]\nparticipants. Supporting this study, there was research done that compared the\ndistribution of memories of participants from Bangladesh, China, England,\nJapan, and the United States. The research found a greater number of childhood\nmemories among American participants than in other cultural groups.^[27] While\nthe timing of the reminiscence bump is generally thought to be culturally\nuniversal, with some minor difference in the period of life from which\nmemories are recalled, there are studies that offer support for the notion\nthat similar life scripts, at least for positive events, might also be found\nacross different cultures.^[28]\n\n### Age factor[edit]\n\nResearch suggests that people younger than 40 years also show a reminiscence\nbump.^[23] It was initially hidden because of the possibility of the recency\neffect. When researchers examined the encoding values, it showed a progressive\nincrease with participant age around the reminiscence bump for participants\nolder than 50.^[27] This proves that the reminiscence bump is stronger for\nolder adults than younger adults.^[26]\n\nThese findings suggest that two processes affect the reminiscence bump\nphenomenon: (1) Events in adolescence are encoded more strongly than events\nthat occur in other periods of life. (2) Because these events are initially\nstored more intensely, they will be retrieved more frequently.^[23]\n\n### Life scripts[edit]\n\nA life script is a schema that outlines cultural appropriate events that\nindividuals should experience during a specific time period. (Berntsen &\nRubin, 2004). The life script account argues that the reminiscence bump occurs\nbecause individuals use life script memories to provide a basis of recalling\nimportant memories. The life script events often contain more memories during\nearly adulthood, or the reminiscence bump, than any other age period (Berntsen\n& Rubin, 2004).The life script account emphasizes norms and expectations\ntypical of a given culture with regard to the timing of major life\nevents.^[28] The order and timing of the major events may differ depending on\nthe culture. The life script is a representation of the sequence of normative\nand major life events. Individuals know the culturally shared expectations of\nthe order and timing of life events in a prototypical life, and are also aware\nof their own timing in relations to those norms.^[28] It assumes that people\nhave an internalized culturally-aware script of the events that make up an\nexpected, skeletal life course; this script acts as a template for the recall\nof life events in association with each life phase.^[29]\n\nA script has two parts: slots and requirements. In the life script, slots are\nculturally important transitional events that are expected to occur within a\ncircumscribed age span in the life course of an individual; and, the\nrequirement is the prescribed appropriate age for the culturally expected\nevent that leads to causal sequencing, in a series of succeeding\nevents.^[30]^[31]^[32]\n\nThe events in a life script are often positive, celebrated, and normative. It\nrepresents and idealized life story. An average life would also include\nnegative events and people would learn from experience. But the life script is\nhanded down from older generations, through stories, and observations of the\nbehavior of others, typically older, people within the same culture.^[30]\nIndividuals should also remember more during their young adulthood because\nthat era is the time of biological maturation, new experiences, adult identity\nformation, and major events in life scripts.^[33]\n\nLife scripts have the following ten properties:\n\n(1) A life script is semantic knowledge about the expectations in a given\nculture about life events, not a form of episodic memory for those events.\n\n(2) A life scripts is a series of temporally ordered events.\n\n(3) A life script can be described in terms of slots and their requirements.\n\n(4) Life scripts form a hierarchical arrangement, with transitional events\nforming a higher order \"scene\" in which a series of subordinate actions or\nepisodes are nested.\n\n(5) Life scripts are used to process stories\u2014here, life stories.\n\n(6) The slots and their requirements for life scripts are culturally important\ntransitional events and their culturally sanctioned timing.\n\n(7) Because life scripts represent a normative life course, life scripts are\nnot extracted from personal actions in recurrent contexts but are transmitted\nby tradition. Young people who have lived through only a small part of their\nlives know the life script of their culture.\n\n(8) Life scripts do not represent an average life but instead represent an\nidealized life, in that many common and important events are left out.\n\n(9) Life scripts are distorted from actual lives to favor positive events.\n\n(10) Life scripts are distorted from actual lives to favor events expected to\noccur in the period covered by the bump.^[30]\n\n#### Results[edit]\n\nStudies confirmed the hypothesis:^[30]\n\n(1) a high overlap among the events generated by the participants, supporting\nthe assumption of a shared cognitive structure\n\n(2) a correlation between the order in which events were generated and their\nestimated dates, consistent with life scripts having a temporal structure\n\n(3) a dominance of positive events, consistent with the assumption of an\nidealized version of life\n\n(4) the age estimates for negative events had higher standard deviation than\nage estimates for positive and neutral events, consistent with the assumption\nthat negative events have more poorly specified temporal slots than the\npositive events\n\n(5) the frequency by which events were recorded was predicted strongly by\nvalence and by whether the event fell during the period of the bump\n\n(6) a dominance of culturally sanctioned transitional events, rather than\npurely biological events, consistent with the claim that mainly culturally\nsanctioned transitional events go into the life script\n\n(7) the majority of positive events were estimated to occur between the ages\nof 15 and 30 years, whereas the life span for negative events was relatively\nflat.\n\n#### Improvements[edit]\n\nModification of the cultural life script theory include: (1) the theory may\nbenefit from explicitly distinguishing between specific transitional events\nand extended periods of stability (2) life script theory proposes that\nrequests for negative events should rarely active the cultural life script,\nbecause negative events are often unexpected.^[34] Their study was based on\nthe individual's unique chapters and specific memories, whereas the cultural\nlife script is a de-personalized and culturally shared knowledge structure.\nFinally, the cultural life script theory seems unable to explain the\nreminiscence bump for public events.^[27]\n\n## Personality[edit]\n\n### Dependence vs. independence[edit]\n\nThere is preferential access to memories of experiences that corresponds with\nan individual's sense of self especially in relation to the mechanisms\ncritical to someone's sense of independence or dependence.^[1]\n\n### Power vs. intimacy[edit]\n\nIt has been identified that individuals with either a strong intimacy\nmotivation or with a distinctive power motivation, and found that the\nintimacy-motivation group recalled peak experiences with a much higher\npercentage of intimacy themes, while the power-motivation group tended to\nrecall peak experiences with strong themes of power and satisfaction.^[35]\n\n### Generativity[edit]\n\nGenerativity refers to nurturing and caring for those things, products, and\npeople that have the potential to outlast the self. Individuals who were\njudged high in generativity, (i.e. who had a commitment story) were found to\nrecall a higher proportion of events related to aspects of generativity. In\ncontrast, those participants without a prominent disposition towards\ngenerativity showed no such bias.^[1]\n\n### Agentic vs. communion[edit]\n\nTwo groups of individuals were investigated, those concerned with personal\npower, achievement, and independence (agentic group) or those concerned with\nrelationships, interdependence, and others (communion group). Agentic types\nconsistently recalled emotional memories of events that involved issues of\nagency such as those involving mastery, dominance, and humiliation. In\ncontrast, communal types showed a recollection bias for emotional memories\nfeaturing others, often significant others, in acts of love and\nfriendship.^[35]\n\n### Memory for happy and sad events[edit]\n\nDifferent emotions have been shown to affect memory. Life events that have\nstronger emotions attached will be remembered more vividly. In studies looking\nat emotional events and the reminiscence bump, older adults tend to remember\nmore positive events than younger adults.^[22] Typically, during the\nreminiscence bump only happy memories and memories of important events are\nrecalled.^[7] It is postulated that sad events are easier to forget because\nthere may be an increased motivation to forget them. Conversely, individuals\nare more likely to recall and relive happy events because they produced\npleasurable memories. A second explanation suggests that remembering positive\nevents can help regulate emotions and even enhance moods.^[22] It is also\npossible to regulate emotions through remembering negative events and\ncomparing these events to present positive events.^[22] Positive or negative\nevents can also be used to share life experiences with others and compare life\nevents.^[22]\n\n## Flashbulb memory[edit]\n\nFlashbulb memory occurs when a very vivid memory of a traumatic, emotional, or\nsignificant event is recalled.^[36] Researchers typically use public events\nsuch as the John F. Kennedy assassination and 9/11 as cues when studying\nflashbulb memories.^[36] Participants are asked to recall very specific\ninformation such as where they were, how they felt, and what they were doing\nwhen the event was taking place.^[36] Memories of these events are easily\nrecalled and the individual believes their account of the event to be\nperfectly accurate.^[36]\n\nThese memories have been tested in different ways, including measuring the\nability to recall details of the event and the impact of additional cues on\nthe recall of the event.^[36] Denver, Lane and Cherry found that flashbulb\nmemories that took place in the reminiscence bump were exceptionally vivid and\neasily accessible.^[36] It is suggested that the flashbulb memories encoded\nduring the reminiscence bump are so vivid because the events happened during a\ntime of identity formation and peak brain function.^[36] Additionally, these\nevents are recalled well because they undergo more rehearsal due to their\nserious nature and frequent discussion.\n\n## Brain damage[edit]\n\nThe impaired functioning of autobiographical memory due to damage or disease\ncan have profound effects on an individual's episodic memory. This can skew an\nindividual's lifespan retrieval curve and influence the presentation of the\nreminiscence bump. Memories an individual has for personal life events can\nshow a different pattern than the average individual if they have brain damage\ncaused by an event like an accident, a blow to the head or disease. For these\nindividuals with brain damage, the lifespan retrieval curve can look\ndifferent. An example of this is an individual having the reminiscence bump\nbetween the age of 5 and 13 rather than 10 to 30, which is the pattern for the\naverage individual.\n\nBrain injury in the frontal lobes can obscure memories and lead to the loss of\ndetails. In more extreme cases patients may even construct available\nautobiographical knowledge into plausible but false memories.^[35]\n\nThe effect of temporal lobe damage on the reminiscence bump is highly variable\nas a function of age at the time of injury. This is because patients with\ndamage to the temporal lobes or underlying structures in the limbic system may\nlose the ability to form new memories, especially if the damage is within the\nhippocampal formation, while retaining access to at least some memories from\nbefore the injury.^[35] Individuals with this type of brain damage are not\nable to form new memories after the incident that caused the brain damage, but\nthey still have access to memories that happened before the brain damage\noccurred. If the brain damage was present at the age of 10, the individual may\nnot remember anything from between the age of 10 and 30 and have no\nreminiscence bump.\n\nThose with damage to regions of the brain involved in visual processing, such\nas the occipital lobes, may develop amnesia. The episodic content of\nautobiographical memories is predominantly encoded in the form of visual\nimages. If the ability to generate visual images is compromised or lost then\naccess to specific details of the past held in episodic images is lost as\nwell.^[35] When life events or episodic memories are encoded in the brain,\nthey are in the form of pictures or visual images. They develop amnesia since\nthey can no longer bring these visual images of the past to mind.\n\nA common psychological phenomenon is the severe clouding of autobiographical\nmemory, which results in the overgeneralization of memories.^[35] For\ninstance, clinically depressed individuals, schizophrenic individuals, and\nthose suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder tend to recall many\nmemories that lack detail (clouded) and are much more schematic than typical\nautobiographical memories. In these instances, a patient asked to recall\nspecific memories of his father could only recall general events such as\n\"walks in the park after Sunday lunch\" and was unable to generate a single\nspecific memory of a single walk.^[35]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Serial position effect\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e Jansari, A.; Parkin, A.
