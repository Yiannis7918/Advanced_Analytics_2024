Now a group of locals are\nworking to revive Asahien, one of Uji\u2019s seven famed tea farms of the past,\nwith plants discovered on the grounds of a city temple.\n\n12 Shares\n\nShare\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nShare\n\nRead in other languages\n\n  * English\n  * \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n  * \u7b80\u4f53\u5b57\n  * \u7e41\u9ad4\u5b57\n  * Fran\u00e7ais\n  * Espa\u00f1ol\n  * \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\n  * \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n\n## Chance Encounter with Traces of Shichimeien\n\nA few years ago, Matsubayashi Toshiyuki of Uji\u2019s only pottery kiln, Asahiyaki,\nwas walking along the approach to the temple K\u014dsh\u014dji, located behind his\nworkplace. It was then that he noticed an old tea bush.\n\nHe was personally interested in tea growing and had studied under Horiguchi\nIchiko, a researcher into natural and Chinese tea, so he consulted her about\nhis discovery. The two excitedly agreed that such an old bush should produce\npotent tea, so they asked at the temple for permission to try making tea from\nits leaves.\n\n\u201cThe temple accepted our request. At the time, though, the thought of Uji\u2019s\nseven fabled tea farms never even crossed my mind,\u201d reflects Matsubayashi.\n\nThe history of Uji tea goes back to the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333), when\nlegends say that the monk Eisai, who founded the Rinzai set of Buddhism in\nJapan, brought tea seeds back to Japan from China and gave some to the monk\nMy\u014de at the temple K\u014dzanji. My\u014de planted the seeds at locations including Uji.\n\nThe area\u2019s legacy as a tea producing center was cemented in the Muromachi\nperiod (1336\u20131573), when the sh\u014dgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358\u20131408) ordered\nthe opening of seven tea farms in Uji. These became known as the Uji Shichi\nMeien\u2014shichi as seven, mei being an ancient word for tea farm, and en a word\nfor garden or field\u2014and included Mori, Iwai, Umoji, Kawashimo, Okunoyama,\nAsahi, and Biwa. Today, only Okunoyama remains active.\n\nThe temple\u2019s Hatt\u014d hall seen through the gate. (\u00a9 Ukita Yasuyuki)\n\nThe K\u014dsh\u014dji monk Isozaki Endai recalls being approached by Matubayashi about\nthe plant. \u201cI came to K\u014dsh\u014dji eleven years ago, but it seems no one really\nunderstood that there were still tea bushes here,\u201d says Isozaki.\n\n## Part of Asahien\n\nK\u014dsh\u014dji was originally opened in 1233 by D\u014dgen, the monk who founded the S\u014dt\u014d\nschool of Zen, as a place to train monks in what is now the Fukakusa\nneighborhood of Fushimi, Kyoto Prefecture. However, D\u014dgen soon left for Fukui\nPrefecture, and the temple he left behind declined and closed around a decade\nafter its opening. Then, in 1645, Nagai Naomasa\u2014lord of Yodo castle and a\ndevout follower of S\u014dt\u014d\u2014had the temple rebuilt on a tea farm on the slopes of\nMout Uji, where it still stands today. It is famous now as the temple\nsanctifying a statue of Shakyamuni Buddha made by D\u014dgen, and the area is\npopular with tourists coming to view autumn leaves along the Kotosaka temple\nroad and to join in the Ujicha Matsuri tea festival held each October.\n\nIsozaki and the Kotosaka road to K\u014dsh\u014dji, known for its autumn leaves. (\u00a9\nUkita Yasuyuki)\n\nHaving said it rests \u201con the slopes of Mout Uji,\u201d though, the section behind\nthe temple is commonly known as Mout Asahi. That makes it reasonable to\nspeculate that K\u014dsh\u014dji and its surroundings might actually be on the former\nsite of Asahien, one of the lost Shichi Meien fields.\n\nTea\u2019s spread has historically centered around Zen temples, and the two are\nintimately linked. According to Isozaki, there were seven tea houses on the\ntemple grounds at the time of its rebuilding. It is not difficult to\nunderstand why Lord Nagai, who himself was a tea ceremony devotee, chose a tea\nfarm for the temple\u2019s restoration.\n\nThe ancient tea bush standing atop a rock wall along Kotosaka. (\u00a9 Ukita\nYasuyuki)\n\nMatsubayashi contacted \u014cgushi Takuji, head of the Tea Industry Research\nDivision of the Kyoto Prefectural Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries\nTechnology Center, to introduce Isozaki. \u014cgushi asked the Kyoto Prefectural\nUniversity to perform DNA analysis on the temple\u2019s tea plants, and the results\nwere that the tea bushes remaining at K\u014dsh\u014dji were most likely native\nvarieties\u2014rather than more common improved cultivars\u2014and all samples collected\nbelonged to the group of native Kyoto varieties.\n\nThe fact that these bushes were native Kyoto varieties may well imply that\nthese were linked to the tea that Eisai shared with My\u014de, which would be like\na dream come true for tea lovers. The specialists are still hoping for\ndocumentation to reinforce their hopes that the tea plants on the temple\ngrounds are the remnants of the Asahien farm, there is no doubt that these\nK\u014dsh\u014dji plants are a valuable genetic resource.\n\nThe K\u014dsh\u014dji h\u014dj\u014d\u2014a room used by the head priest\u2014holds a hanging scroll with a\nbird\u2019s eye view painting of the temple by Mori Ipp\u014d, a painter active in the\nlate nineteenth century. It shows that at that time, tea fields spread out\naround the temple gate and along the slope on the temple\u2019s easter side. If at\nsome time documents are found with written descriptions of Asahien\u2019s location,\nit would strengthen the chances that this location could be officially\nrecognized as the site of that historic farm.\n\nThe hanging scroll by painter Mori Ipp\u014d. (\u00a9 Ukita Yasuyuki)\n\n## The Value of a Native Variety\n\nIn the summer of 2021, \u014cgushi guided Isozaki and Matsubayashi in growing\nsprouts from cuttings. Then, in the spring of 2022, they planted seeds taken\nin the fall of the same year and tried their hand at germinating seeds and\ngrowing true seedlings.\n\nToday, most commercially grown tea plants are what is known as \u201cimproved\ncultivars,\u201d or simply cultivars, which are propagated through cuttings,\nmeaning clones. These stand in contrast to the so-called \u201cnative varieties\u201d\nthat have grown in this soil since ancient times.\n\nNative-variety plants are difficult to manage in the field, and their foliage\nproduction varies, so many farmers have come to rely on the more consistent\ncultivars. Germinating seedlings is a challenge because it has a lower success\nrate than propagation through cuttings, but people believe that a successful\nseedling can produce more robust, longer-lived plants. These ideas of \u201cnative\nvarieties\u201d and \u201cseedlings\u201d are as romantic in the tea world as \u201cendemic\nvarieties\u2019\u201d and \u201cautochthonous grapes\u201d are in the wine world.\n\nOn the left are tea plants propagated through cuttings, while on the right are\nthose from seedlings. The latter are supposedly longer-lived. (\u00a9 Ukita\nYasuyuki)\n\nIsozaki has this to say about future developments: \u201cI want people to learn\nabout Zen through tea, and through Zen about the mountains, and so become\ncloser to nature. We want to put tea at the center of all of that together. I\nhope that people can come to appreciate the Zen concepts of fury\u016b monji\n(beyond words or letters) and kotan jakuj\u014d (elegant simplicity and\ntranquility) through growing tea plants, making tea, drinking it, and sharing\nit with others.\u201d\n\n## A Famous Tea Surviving in Hiding\n\nAs to the all-important flavor of the tea, Matsubayashi has used the tea\nleaves from K\u014dsh\u014dji to make oolong tea, black tea, and roasted kamairi-cha. He\nsays, \u201cIt is tea with firm body and sweetness.\u201d I made a special request to\nMatsubayashi for a taste of his priceless oolong.\n\nOolong tea made from the leaves of K\u014dsh\u014dji\u2019s plants. (\u00a9 Ukita Yasuyuki)\n\nOur venue was a large study connected to the Hatt\u014d lecture hall. Guests\nincluded two of Matsubayashi\u2019s acquaintances with fascinating roles in the Uji\ntea world\u2014Ts\u016ben Yusuke, the twenty-fourth-generation head of the Ts\u016ben tea\nhouse, and Yamamoto Jinjir\u014d, the sixth-generation head of a tea shop bearing\nhis name.\n\nTs\u016ben was also head of the Kyoto Tea Association Youth Wing. He has already\ntaken the lead in offering native varieties of tea at his shop, sensing their\npotential as field blends. Yamamoto is taking on his own challenges, including\nusing the nearly extinct cultivation method known as honzu saibai, which uses\nthick reed screens to shield tea leaves from the sun when growing tea for\nmatcha (instead of more commonly available vinyl black sheets), and the\npursuit of single-origin tea sourced in varieties from single fields.\n\nI asked these three men to discuss their thoughts on this attempt to revive\nAsahien as we enjoyed our tea.\n\nFrom left: Matsubayashi Toshiyuki, Ts\u016ben Yusuke, and Yamamoto Jinjir\u014d. (\u00a9\nUkita Yasuyuki)\n\nMatsubayashi notes, \u201cWe burned sugi cryptomeria needles in the hearth here to\ndry the leaves, and I think the smokey aroma of that lingers.\u201d\n\nAdds Yamamoto, \u201cIt\u2019s a gentle flavor.\u201d\n\nTs\u016ben had this to say: \u201cIf we could revive another one of the Shichi Meien\nfields, I would be happy. It would be fascinating. It\u2019s wonderful that anyone\ncan buy and drink the tea from Okunoyama, but here I get the wholly different\nidea of using this tea at this place of ascetic Zen practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s good to have all different kinds of inroads for people to know\nmore about the deep world of tea,\u201d adds Matsubayashi. \u201cIf all we have are\nmatcha-flavored sweets, people won\u2019t take that next step. With this ancient\ntemple and these precious tea plants, we can extend the story from there and\npeople can go further.\u201d\n\nYamamoto says, \u201cI understand the temple itself had a tea factory on the\npremises before the war. I\u2019m really curious about what kind of tea a Zen\ntemple made and what processes they used.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe DNA analysis said this is highly likely to be native,\u201d says Ts\u016ben. \u201cIf it\nis, then the plant itself must be incredibly old, and that proves just how\nwell tended the fields must have been in the past. About forty years ago, the\nyabukita cultivar got very popular, and while that did stabilize quality, it\nmade for very homogenous tea. Native varieties are all individually unique, so\nharvest timing is difficult, and quality is hit or miss. But that\u2019s what makes\nit so interesting. Someone once said native varieties are \u2018God\u2019s blend\u2019 and I\nthink that is exactly right.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be nice if people became more curious about native varieties because\nof the K\u014dsh\u014dji tea plants,\u201d says Yamamoto to finish.\n\nThe dye made from cape jasmine seeds as a reddish-yellow color called in\nJapanese iwanu , which can also mean \u201cnot speaking,\u201d and that is precisely the\ncolor of the oolong tea made from K\u014dsh\u014dji\u2019s native leaves. Brewed into oolong\ntea with boiled water from the temple well created an eloquent argument\nexpressing, in a way indeed going \u201cbeyond words,\u201d the potential for the hopes\nof reviving Asahien to become a new tool for demonstrating the pleasures of\nUji tea.\n\nThe group plans to move 1,000 seedlings currently under its care to the slopes\nbehind the temple.\n\n(Originally published in Japanese.
