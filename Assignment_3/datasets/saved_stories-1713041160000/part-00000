Earth is at the\ncenter of this thin slice of the full map. In the magnified section, it is\neasy to see the underlying structure of matter in our universe.\n\nClaire Lamman/DESI collaboration; custom colormap package by cmastro\n\nDark energy may be even more complicated than scientists have bargained for,\npotentially \u201cevolving\u201d over time rather than remaining relentlessly constant\nin its acceleration of cosmic expansion. That\u2019s according to early results\nfrom a project that is developing the largest three-dimensional map of the\nuniverse to date. The findings hint that galaxies aren\u2019t spread across the\nuniverse as they should be if dark energy\u2019s effects were unchanging.\n\nEven just the possibility of this surprising twist has physicists excited. \u201cIf\nit\u2019s confirmed that we\u2019re actually seeing an evolution of dark energy, this\nwould be a profoundly important discovery,\u201d says Lloyd Knox, a cosmologist at\nthe University of California, Davis, who is not involved in the new research.\nThe seemingly academic matter has big implications for the universe, shaping\nwhether and how it will end.\n\nAs of now, the evidence for dark energy\u2019s evolution is intriguing yet not\ncompelling enough for scientists to start rewriting their understanding of the\nuniverse. \u201cBut it\u2019s a hint, and it\u2019s very interesting, so we\u2019re really looking\nforward to more data to see where that hint goes,\u201d says Nathalie Palanque-\nDelabrouille, a cosmologist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a\nspokesperson for the project, called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument\n(DESI).\n\nFrom its perch on a telescope atop Kitt Peak in Arizona, DESI seeks to\nrevolutionize the study of dark energy, which makes up about 70 percent of the\nuniverse. Some 900 scientists are part of the project, and just like all their\npeers, none of them really knows what dark energy is\u2014mostly because they can\u2019t\nstudy it directly. Physicists can only measure dark energy by observing its\neffects, such as its influence on the spacing of large groups of galaxies.\n\nThat\u2019s why DESI, at its heart, is essentially just a mission to map the\ndistribution of matter throughout an immense swath of the observable universe.\nTo do this, the instrument uses a technique called spectroscopy, gathering\nlight from a galaxy, a star or some other cosmic source that is then sorted by\nwavelength to create a rainbowlike barcode called a spectrum. Inside that\nspectrum, scientists can discern the signature of the expansion of the\nuniverse\u2014which stretches all light traveling through space. This stretching\nmakes light appear redder, with longer wavelengths, which astronomers call\nredshift. They can use the phenomenon to measure relative distance, with more\nstrongly redshifted light coming from farther out in space and thus deeper\nback in time.\n\nThis technique is enormously powerful for studying individual objects, but\nDESI can massively multitask, delivering spectra for 5,000 targets at a time.\nAn analysis of the first year of its operations, which began in 2021, includes\ndata on some six million objects, including galaxies, stars and quasars (the\nextremely luminous cores of active galaxies). \u201cWhat makes DESI so unique is\nthat it is a machine at measuring redshifts,\u201d Palanque-Delabrouille says.\n\nFrom all those spectra, the DESI team has constructed what is already the\nlargest 3D map of the universe to date, charting 11 billion years of cosmic\nhistory\u2014a valuable resource for even those astronomers with no interest in\ndark energy. For example, the DESI data can inform our understanding of tiny\nparticles called neutrinos, as well as clusters of galaxies and the great\nvoids that lie between them.\n\nBut for researchers focused on dark energy, DESI\u2019s ultradetailed map reveals a\nsubtle, telltale pattern embedded in the universe during its earliest days,\nwhen giant sound waves (now called baryon acoustic oscillations) reverberated\nthrough the primordial plasma that then suffused the cosmos. These waves left\nenormous bubblelike echoes in the distribution of matter upon which galaxies\nsubsequently coalesced. Measuring the resulting ringlike galactic patterns,\nwhich are always of a characteristic size, allows cosmologists to better\ncalibrate cosmic distances, anchoring DESI\u2019s flood of redshift measurements\nand enhancing its gauge of dark energy\u2019s activity across the universe\u2019s\nhistory.\n\n## Curated by Our Editors\n\n  * ### Unprecedented Supernova Survey Underscores Dark Energy Mystery\n\nAshley Balzer Vigil\n\n  * ### The Most Shocking Discovery in Astrophysics Is 25 Years Old\n\nRichard Panek\n\n  * ### The Cosmological Constant Is Physics' Most Embarrassing Problem\n\nClara Moskowitz\n\n  * ### Here's Why We Might Live in a Multiverse\n\nSarah Scoles\n\n\u201cDESI is a really great experiment producing stupendous data, and this first\nrelease is offering us a great taste of what\u2019s to come,\u201d says Adam Riess, a\ncosmologist at Johns Hopkins University, who shared the 2011 Nobel Prize in\nPhysics for the discovery of dark energy but is not involved in the project.\n\nPoring over DESI\u2019s first year of observations, its science team opted to use\nan analytic technique that masked the original data to prevent any\nsubconscious bias from altering the researchers\u2019 work. Only a few months ago,\nwhen that masking was lifted, did they realize that the experiment\u2019s initial\nresults held what seemed to be a tantalizing surprise about dark energy itself\nrather than simple confirmation that the project was working as planned.\n\nGoing into the analysis, the scientists expected their results to align with\nhow the universe would behave if dark energy were a constant, static\nphenomenon\u2014which is indeed what the early results of DESI alone indicated. But\nwhen the cosmologists combined those results with data from other key projects\ninvestigating dark energy, they found a hint that those collective results\nbetter matched what they\u2019d expect to see if dark energy changed, or evolved,\nover time. Galaxies closer to us in space and time seem, in fact, a bit too\nclose, as if dark energy\u2019s repulsive force had somehow begun to fade in recent\ncosmic epochs. \u201cWe do see an indication that the simplest model might not be\nthe one that describes the universe,\u201d Palanque-Delabrouille says.\n\nSussing out whether this hint is real rather than simply an artifact of how\nthe data from different projects were combined will require much more\ninformation from DESI. Fortunately, the scientists already have another two\nyears of data from the experiment to work with, and the instrument is slated\nto keep observing until 2026. The complete five years of data will include\nobservations of some 40 million galaxies, Palanque-Delabrouille says.\n\nShe and her colleagues are also compiling a proposal for a second phase of the\nexperiment. In addition, two instruments that will begin operations later this\ndecade will be gathering similar data: the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile\nand NASA\u2019s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Both are designed to complement\nDESI in its quest to untangle dark energy, making the coming years\nparticularly tantalizing for cosmologists.\n\n\u201cFinding out the nature of dark energy or what is causing the observed\nacceleration in the expansion of the universe is my life\u2019s work,\u201d says Yun\nWang, a cosmologist at the California Institute of Technology, who is not\ninvolved in DESI. \u201cSo anything\u2014any new data, any new insight on the\nobservational side\u2014is exciting to me.\u201d\n\nAnd the stakes are surprisingly high, she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s huge\u2014huge and exciting,\u201d\nWang says of the mystery of dark energy. \u201cWhat dark energy is or whatever is\ncausing the observed cosmic acceleration will ultimately determine the fate of\nthe whole universe.\u201d\n\nThe results are described in a set of papers posted on the preprint server\narXiv.org in early April.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nMeghan Bartels is a science journalist based in New York City.
