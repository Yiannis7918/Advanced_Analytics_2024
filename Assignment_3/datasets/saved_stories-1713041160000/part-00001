Collection of the Galleria dell'Accademia,\nFlorence.\n\nby Taylor Dafoe June 1, 2023\n\nAn Italian court has ruled in favor of Florence\u2019s Gallerie dell\u2019Accademia in\nits lawsuit against the publishing house Edizioni Conde Nast, which used an\nimage of Michelangelo\u2019s David without permission.\n\nThe publisher reportedly projected David\u2019s face onto the head of a model for a\npicture that appeared on the cover of a magazine. However, the company did not\nobtain a license from the museum, which owns the image rights to the famed\n500-year-old sculpture, even though the artwork belongs to the public domain.\n\nThe case hinged on article nine of Italy\u2019s constitution, which protects\nsymbols of the nation\u2019s cultural identity and historical memory. A related law\nallows the country\u2019s public institutions to request concession fees for\ncommercial reproductions of artworks of cultural heritage, regardless of their\ncopyright status.\n\nIn a statement, the museum claimed that by \u201cinsidiously and maliciously\n[juxtaposing] the image of Michelangelo\u2019s David with that of a model,\u201d the\npublisher was \u201cdebasing, obfuscating, mortifying, and humiliating the high\nsymbolic and identity value of the work of art and subjugating it for\nadvertising and editorial promotion purposes.\u201d\n\nThe August 2020 edition of GQ Italia with model Pietro Boselli superimposed\nover Michelangelo\u2019s David.\n\nThe Florence court ruled on May 15 that the publisher must pay the museum two\nseparate amounts: \u20ac20,000 for the licensing fee, and an additional \u20ac30,000 for\nthe way in which David\u2019s image was distorted for the magazine.\n\nCecilie Hollberg, director of the Galleria dell\u2019Accademia, called the ruling a\n\u201cgreat achievement\u201d for the institution. \u201cA principle has now been affirmed\nthat goes beyond the individual case,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the ruling of the Court of Florence on Michelangelo\u2019s David,\nwhich recognizes the principle of an image right for cultural heritage,\u201d said\nGennaro Sangiuliano, Italy\u2019s Minister of Culture, in a statement. \u201cIt must be\nsaid that the use for commercial purposes for cultural goods must be paid\nwhile it must be free for images for educational and study purposes. It is\ncomforting that the judges think like the Ministry of Culture.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time an Italian institution has sought legal action over\ndepictions of famous artworks. Earlier this year, the Gallerie dell\u2019Accademia\nin Venice brought a lawsuit against the German toy company Ravensburger over a\npuzzle featuring Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s iconic Vitruvian Man drawing. The court\nruled in favor of the museum and blocked Ravensburger from producing future\neditions of the product.\n\nFollow Artnet News on Facebook:\n\nWant to stay ahead of the art world?
