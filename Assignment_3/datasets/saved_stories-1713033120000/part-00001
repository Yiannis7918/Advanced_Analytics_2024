Vulnerable young children deserve\njustice\n\nA protestor outside Downing Street (Vuk Valcic/SOPA Images/LightRocket via\nGetty Images)\n\nA protestor outside Downing Street (Vuk Valcic/SOPA Images/LightRocket via\nGetty Images)\n\nCass ReportGenderHealthNHSSocietyTransgenderUK\n\n##### Dr Anna Hutchinson\n\n###### April 10, 2024 5 mins\n\nWhen the US astronomer Carl Sagan stated that \u201cextraordinary claims demand\nextraordinary evidence\u201d, he was riffing on an idea that has influenced the\nscientific method since the mid-1700s. If we are to conclude extraordinary\nthings, ideas that conflict with what we already think we know, then we need\nlarge amounts of quality evidence to justify doing so. The fact that we forgot\nto apply such basic scientific principles at the Tavistock Gender Identity\nDevelopment Service (GIDS) is, in and of itself, extraordinary.\n\nOpened in 1989, and closed following a litany of scandals last year, GIDS \u2014\nthe UK\u2019s only specialist service designed to help children questioning their\ngender and/or identifying as transgender \u2014 drew on just one, since widely\ncritiqued, study to underpin its practice. This, despite the fact that it has\ntreated roughly 2,000 young people with hormone blockers and in some cases\ncross-sex hormones.\n\n\u201cThe Dutch Protocol\u201d describes a three-step treatment pathway for children\nwith gender-related distress or incongruence. It starts at the brink of\npuberty with puberty blockers to prevent the development of secondary sex\ncharacteristics, is followed by cross-sex hormones that help to feminise or\nmasculinise appearance, and then concludes with genital and/or breast\nsurgeries in adulthood. The Dutch reported that, after puberty suppression\nalone, their cohort of 70 young people experienced a reduction in behavioural\nand emotional problems, decreased symptoms of depression and a significant\nimprovement in functioning. Despite choosing to make medical treatments\navailable to younger children from 2014 anyway, GIDS were not able to\nreplicate the Dutch findings \u2014 a fact they didn\u2019t share with the world until\n2021.\n\nGiven the increasing polarity among professionals on the matter, Dr Hilary\nCass, a former President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health,\nwas employed by the NHS to conduct a review of the published evidence on the\nuse of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones in children and young people\nwith gender dysphoria. In March 2021, she concluded that they had not been\nable to find evidence \u201cstrong enough to form the basis of a policy position\u201d.\nIt was clear then, at least to those paying attention, that the evidence\nneeded to justify the existing clinical practice in Gids did not exist. And\nyet, it wasn\u2019t until last month that the NHS announced it would no longer be\noffering puberty blockers to young people in England and Wales.\n\nMore from this author\n\n##### The trouble with conversion therapy\n\nBy Anna Hutchinson\n\nToday, as Cass finally publishes the results of her wide-ranging review, the\nreason seems obvious: her 388-page report concludes that, for most young\npeople, up to the age of 25, \u201ca medical pathway will not be the best way to\nmanage their gender-related distress\u201d. Commenting further on the lack of\nevidence, she states that not only is there no way for a clinician to\naccurately determine who will continue to identify as trans for life and who\nwon\u2019t, but that the fundamental rationale for using puberty blockers in the\nfirst place \u201cremains unclear\u201d. She speaks of the need to balance medical\ninnovation with the potential \u201ccreep of unproven approaches into clinical\npractice\u201d and calls for the use of \u201cstandard evidence-based\u201d interventions\ninstead.\n\nCass also makes it clear that the factors influencing gender-related distress\nmight be as much social as psychological or biological, with a particular\nfocus on the new cohort of adolescent girls who now make up the majority of\ngender clinic patients. Instead, she suggests, we need to draw on bio-psycho-\nsocial thinking to ensure that future child patients receive the safe and\neffective care they deserve.\n\nThe motivation behind this isn\u2019t hard to glean. The sociological \u201cbroken\nwindows\u201d theory hypothesises that, once something becomes damaged just a\nlittle, it sends a message that the thing is no longer of value at all, and\nleads to further vandalism. At heart, the Cass Report is an attempt to prevent\nthis from happening: it punctuates a process that, left unchallenged, might\nhave led to further extraordinary practices creeping into other areas of\npsychology or medicine.\n\nFor those of us working in the field of gender, the influence of social media\non adolescent mental health, in multiple and complex ways, has been\nundeniable. What gets less attention is the impact on us, the adults and\nprofessionals. After all, we are just as vulnerable to social influence,\nincluding misinformation. One of the factors that has led to the increased\ndemand for medical interventions from gender-distressed young people are the\nideas, widely shared on social media platforms as facts, that the medical\npathway is not only safe but effective, even life-saving, for all.\n\nSuggested reading\n\n##### Inside Britain's new trans clinics\n\nBy Kathleen Stock\n\nDespite the absence of face validity or the long-term data needed for such\ncertainty, some have claimed that regret rates for the surgeries many Gids\npatients received during early adulthood are lower than for knee surgeries.\nYet, as the Cass Report highlights, some of the \u201cfacts\u201d shared online are not\ncertainties but myths. Sadly, for example, some young people do later\nexperience profound regret \u2014 a reality that Cass acknowledges in her\nrecommendation that \u201cNHS England should ensure there is provision for people\nconsidering detransition\u201d.\n\nYet rather than accept Cass\u2019s rational, evidenced conclusions, a number of\nprofessionals and institutions will no doubt continue to argue with certainty\nthat access to medical interventions is both a necessity and a human right.\nThey already call for their colleagues to join them in becoming \u201cpractitioner-\nactivists\u201d. Others openly describe their motivation to pursue the medical\napproach Cass wishes to end as being \u201cbased on how passionate we are about the\nwork\u201d. Passion can be a good thing, of course, when aligned to evidence and\nfact. But when passion becomes untethered to these, or worse tethered to\nmisinformation, it risks transporting us into a troublesome arena. Such an\napproach has already led to serious lapses in best practice and governance,\nparticularly in relation to the use of puberty blockers for children. The\nquestion now is: will such extraordinary practices be able to continue post-\nCass?\n\n\u201cThe question now is: will such extraordinary practices be able to continue\npost-Cass?\u201d\n\nThis is where a sense of concern starts to creep in. For while NHS England has\nrefocused on the need for evidence-based interventions in recent years, some\npractitioners have already made clear their resistance to this. Last year, we\nheard that the endocrinologist responsible for prescribing to Gids patients\nhad questioned whether the Cass Review was necessary in the first place.\nLeaders in the field of clinical psychology have also challenged the need for\nthe review, and splits in the UK\u2019s two psychology associations have been\napparent for a while now, with one publicly criticising Cass. Remarkably, as\ntoday\u2019s report discloses, the NHS\u2019s adult gender clinics have also set\nthemselves up in opposition to evidence and research, by refusing to\nparticipate in the Cass Review\u2019s centrepiece longitudinal research study \u2014 an\nattempt, albeit retrospective, to follow into adulthood the 10,000 young\npeople who\u2019ve been through GIDS\u2019s doors.\n\nIn an attempt to explain away such behaviour, some have sympathetically\ndescribed GIDS as a \u201cjustice project\u201d. Yet, in her interim report, published\nin February 2022, Cass made clear that the implications of GIDS\u2019s approach\nwere far more serious than this: its clinical approach, she wrote, had \u201cnot\nbeen subjected to some of the usual control measures that are typically\napplied when new or innovative treatments are introduced\u201d. Just over two years\nlater, she ends her final report by remarking that, while GIDS clinicians were\n\u201cpassionate and wholly committed to their care, [they] had developed a\nfundamentally different philosophy and approach compared to other paediatric\nand mental health services\u201d. This deviation from best practice was, in other\nwords, an injustice, and resulted in one group of children receiving less\nrobust standards of care than others.\n\nTo mitigate this, Cass invites a return to the ordinary, and an embrace of the\nscientific method. And this requires sensitivity: after all, understanding why\ngender-distressed and non-conforming people might have been reluctant to trust\nordinary science, medicine and psychology/psychiatry should also be part of\nthe post-mortem to come. Medical approaches and institutions haven\u2019t always\nbeen a safe place for them. Sadly, this is not the first time that gender non-\nconforming people have been considered so different as to require\nextraordinary treatment. Perhaps Cass\u2019s recommendation to offer regular\ntreatments to our distressed, but still ordinary, children and young people is\nwhere the true justice will begin.\n\nDr Anna Hutchinson is a clinical psychologist who specialises in adolescent\nmental health, gender and physical health.

Responses that\nmay or may not be truthful, and may or may not be influenced by interested\nthird parties/soshal meeja.\n\nIf Dr Cass had found \u2018medical evidence\u2019 in support of puberty blockers, I\nsuggest we should have been just as sceptical. WE ARE USING THE WRONG MODEL.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nJack Robertson\n\n3 days ago\n\nThe recent decision by the US National Association of Intercollegiate\nAthletics to ban transgender women from competing in women\u2019s categories came\nonly after a dozen female athletes sued the bigger National Collegiate\nAthletic Association for allowing a practice they rightly argue is profoundly\ndiscriminatory against biological women. These measured, rational intellectual\narguments against this Insane Homophobic Misogynists Cult are all very well,\nbut the elite public sentiment on gender \u2018affirmation\u2019 therapy has already\nturned \u2013 and the common sense of the masses never needed turning in the first\nplace. What\u2019s really needed now are a) pro-bono lawsuits on behalf of\ndetransitioners and their families whose lives have been most impacted by this\nInsane Homophobic Misogynists Cult; b) the public outing of and reckoning for\nall those senior clinical experts who created and stewarded this Insane\nHomophobic Misogynists Cult; and c) a forensic, retrospective public\nidentification of and reckoning for those powerful and influential political,\nmedia and public health figures who might have helped counter and dismantle\nthis Insane Homophobic Misogynists Cult earlier, but for various cowardly,\nexpedient, careerist or other cynical reasons, chose not to. The rest is just\nrepeating what is by now an increasingly confident (and angry) \u2018public debate\u2019\nmajority view: a belated (re-)recognition and (re-) embrace of what should\nalways have been an absurdly self-evident truth that ought never have been up\nfor debate in the first place. Namely, that responding to a young, still-\nforming persons\u2019 unhappiness with and in their perfectly healthy, functioning\nbody by advocating \u2013 and clinically effecting \u2013 that their body should be\npoisoned with unnecessary chemicals and that pieces of their body should be\nsurgically amputated or removed \u2013 is not the work of any sane, civilised\nhealth system.

The hold-out\nideological cultists driving this \u2013 those \u2018Never Stop Fighting\u2019 types who\nregard their cult as a noble crusade \u2013 will never care who has to pay out. But\nthe vast army of intellectual cowards, political lemmings, corporate\ncareerists, media opportunists, economic rent-seekers, celebrity relevance-\nharvesters and click-hungry anonymous wannabes who have constituted their\nenabling Praetorian Guard for so long sure as sh*t will. Defeating barbarism\nis usually not very pretty and it\u2019s never intellectually \u2018neat\u2019. That\u2019s why\nacademics and intellectuals are so defenceless before it (along with quackery,\ngrifting and moral hazard). Dr Hutchinson\u2019s article on this topic is another\nvery fine one, from an UnHerd crew that includes many gutsy independent\nthinkers who\u2019ve been rare sources of sanity on gender disphoria for a long,\nmostly lonely time. But that\u2019s shifting now, and we the great unwashed don\u2019t\nreally need to be yet again reminded by clever people \u2013 ruinously belatedly as\nfar as \u2018expert\u2019 public sentiment goes \u2013 that our basic human instincts were\ndead right all along. We need it to be stopped. I\u2019m not terribly exercised by\nany need for retribution. I just want gender \u2018affirmation\u2019 \u2018therapy\u2019 to be\nprevented from ruining any more already-suffering young lives. I have no\nparticular axe to grind against gender disphoria. I\u2019m vaguely happy to accept\nthat it\u2019s a real thing...provided gender disphoria experts return to adding\nthe clinically accurate modifier \u2018...albeit very rare\u2018. But one doesn\u2019t need\nto be an expert to know that lifelong-medicalised, permanent bodily\nmodification in response to possible but yet unconfirmed diagnoses of it,\nespecially in young people, is a doomed, catastrophe-in-waiting of a\n\u2018therapy\u2019. So, like millions and millions of stunned and appalled and\nincreasingly angry parents worldwide, all I want is for our medical sector to\nstop advocating it, and stop putting it into practice: this premature pumping\ninto healthy, functioning, physically normal young bodies of chemicals that\nphysically harm them, and this premature surgical excision of healthy,\nfunctioning, physically normal bits off, or out, of them. As a \u2018therapy\u2019 for\nyoung people being unhappy with those bodies, FFS. For. F**k\u2019s. Sake.\nInsanity. Barbaric, anti-Hippocratic insanity. We can\u2019t physically prevent \u2013\nkill, restrain, lock up, hound into relatively harmless exile outside\ncivilised society \u2013 the clinicians doing this, as one could a Mengele. But as\nHutchinson at least implies, the most clinically arrogant, morally obtuse and\ndeeply cult-programmed of them are unlikely to stop just because the NHS has\nbanned it. As with all cults, outsider status is as likely to bolster their\nrighteous crusading determination as dampen it. Suing them \u2013 in order to scare\noff their wider clinical, logistic, financial, insurance, political, media and\ncelebrity enabling mis en scene \u2013 is the next most available blunt-but-\neffective defensive weapon we, the stupid sane masses, have at our disposal.\nAs I said, hardly pretty. Nobody wants to make litigation lawyers any richer\nthan they already are, nor provide yet more public panto content-fodder for\nthe cynical media machinery that so helped fuel this Bonfire of The Clinical\nSanities in the first place.

But over the last 10 years, that number has grown to more than 3,000\nyoung people, she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cAnd it\u2019s mainly birth-\nregistered girls presenting in early teens, and often with quite complex\nadditional problems.\u201d\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-68770641?xtor=ES-208-%5B71571_NEWS_NLB_ABC_WK15_WED_10_APR%5D-20240410-%5Bbbcnews_cassreportgendencarechildren_newshealth%5D\n\n5\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nJohn Tyler\n\n2 days ago\n\nAnswer to headline... probably not so long as we remain in ECHR.\n\n5\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nUnHerd Reader\n\n2 days ago\n\nAs Dr. Cass reported, a long-term study on the effect of puberty blockers is\nneeded. There is, however, a lot of anecdotal evidence concerning the blocker\nLupron, the most commonly used in the U.S. There are almost 15,000 adverse\neffects reported to the FDA. There are forums for people who took the\nmedication for precocious puberty (mainly women), endometriosis and prostate\ncancer. All of them say Lupron destroyed their lives. Adverse effects include\nosteoporosis, tooth loss, severe joint pain leaving them wheelchair bound and\non potent pain killers, loss of cognitive ability, fractures and more. Most of\nthe women are in their twenties. The FDA refuses to investigate whether Lupron\nis dangerous (duh). I would think that tens of thousands of people who have\nbeen permanently disabled by the blocker would warrant a study.\n\n4\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nUnHerd Reader\n\n3 days ago\n\nExcellent article. The capture of so many otherwise thoughtful and caring\npeople by ideology at the expense of evidence is a frightening modern trend we\nneed to fight on every front. Wishful over-claiming by some in the evidence-\nbased movement (esp in social & psychological care, but also in medicine) may\nhave been partly at the root of this, unfortunately: there have been times in\nthe recent past when the call for \u2018only evidence-based intervention\u2019 has\nitself seemed more ideologically than scientifically-led.
