The change applies only to some people using Google in California,\nthough it is not clear how many.\n\nThe California Journalism Preservation Act (CJPA) would require large online\nplatforms to pay a \u201cjournalism usage fee\u201d for linking to news sites based in\nthe Golden state. The bill cleared the California assembly in 2023. To become\nlaw, it would need to pass in the Senate before being signed by the governor,\nGavin Newsom.\n\nMisleading clickbait is prevalent on Facebook and Instagram in Canada after\nMeta\u2019s news ban. Could it happen in Australia?\n\nRead more\n\nIn a blog post published Friday, Jaffer Zaidi, Google\u2019s head of global news\npartnerships, explained that the company is experimenting with removing local\nnews links for a \u201csmall percentage\u201d of California users in preparation for the\nbill potentially passing.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take these decisions lightly and want to be transparent with\nCalifornia publishers, lawmakers and our users,\u201d he said. \u201cTo avoid an outcome\nwhere all parties lose and the California news industry is left worse off, we\nurge lawmakers to take a different approach.\u201d\n\nGoogle will also suspend \u201cfurther investments in the California news\necosystem\u201d, the blog post said, cutting California publications from its\nGoogle News Showcase, a feature that pushes stories to users in a streamlined\nfeed in an effort to boost traffic to publishers.\n\nIn May 2023, in response to the California legislation, Meta said it would be\nforced to remove news content from Facebook and Instagram \u201crather than pay\ninto a slush fund that primarily benefits big, out-of-state media companies\u201d.\nThe company has not yet followed through on those statements, and did not\nimmediately respond to request for comment.\n\nThe California bill is meant to support the local journalism industry, which\nhas been gutted in recent decades in part due to the rise of social media and\nother online means of accessing news. But media equity advocates say that the\nlegislation is misguided, and stands to benefit larger publishers over smaller\noutlets that are seeing more drastic impacts.\n\nA study conducted by Free Press Action, a media-reform advocacy group, found\nthat more than 80% of websites that would benefit from reimbursement mandated\nby the bill are owned by just 20 major firms. Because of this, major media\ncompanies have lobbied heavily against the legislation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Google versus corporate media fight, and in the end California\nresidents are the ones being harmed,\u201d said Mike Rispoli, senior director at\nFree Press Action. \u201cIt speaks to real challenges facing local news today when\nhow the news is created and how it is accessed is controlled by these large\ncorporations that are just looking after themselves.\u201d\n\nThe California bill is the latest to challenge big tech firms over their\nimpact on news publishers. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, and Alphabet,\nGoogle\u2019s parent company, have battled similar legislation in Australia and\nCanada. That fight came to a head in Canada when Meta turned off news services\nin the country in 2023, in the midst of a wildfire crisis. The blockade on\nlinks to news in Canada is ongoing.\n\nMeta has also continued to scale back its news services in Australia after the\ncountry passed a bill in 2021 forcing social media firms to pay publishers for\ncontent shared on their platforms. In March it escalated the battle with\nlawmakers there by stating it would stop paying publishers there for content.\n\nSimilar legislation is being considered in Illinois. Introduced in February\n2024, the Journalism Preservation act would require social media firms to pay\na fee based on how many times per month they link to a news outlet\u2019s work.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Google\n  * California\n  * Alphabet\n  * Meta\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
