Originally\nreleased in 2011, I was able to pick one up, new-old stock, for around $60\nCAD.\n\nBefore switching to my Blackberry, I ran a de-Googled Android phone. Primarily\nI used it for GPS, but I also had a few time-wasting apps (like a FOSS Reddit\nclient) that I'd occasionally use during downtime.\n\n### The Pinephone\n\nThis isn't my first time with an esoteric cell phone. For a few months in\n2022, I tried to daily drive a Pinephone. If you're not aware, the Pinephone\nis a fully FOSS phone that runs a fairly standard Linux kernel. Unfortunately,\nI wasn't able to switch to it as my sole cellular device. Generally I'd carry\nmy Android phone with me as well, for GPS. I also found the Pinephone would\nsometimes lag when playing music over Bluetooth. I was able to improve this by\nchanging some config settings but I wasn't able to fix it entirely. In\ngeneral, it was a laggy experience, but I put up with it until my Mobian\ninstall bricked itself twice. At that point, I gave up and switched back to my\nAndroid, where I remained until getting my current Blackberry.\n\n### First steps with the Blackberry\n\nThere were a few hurdles when getting started with the Blackberry.\n\nAlthough the phone supports 2G and 3G, it doesn't support any versions of 3G\nthat are supported by any cell carriers here in Atlantic Canada. Instead, I\nhad to switch to a provider that still has 2G support. I'm pretty sure that\nofficially, we don't have any 2G networks so my phone could stop working at\nany moment.\n\nBlackberry shut down all infrastructure related to my phone about a year ago.\nI can't download apps (the app store doesn't work) but I can sideload them,\nassuming I can find them online. I couldn't locate a working download for a\nflashlight app, but I was able to download Opera. I tend to use it because it\nhas a newer certificate store than the built-in browser.\n\nI did try to update the phone's certificate store manually, but it didn't seem\nto make a difference to the browser. I'm not sure if I was doing it wrong, or\nif the browser has an internal certificate store of its own.\n\n### GPS\n\nGPS is probably what I used to use my Android phone for the most. Even when\ntravelling within my own city, I would use it when going to an unfamiliar\ndestination. I go on a lot of road trips, and I found I was entirely dependent\non my GPS to get anywhere.\n\nWhen I switched to my Blackberry, I quit GPS cold-turkey. And honestly? It's\nawesome! It feels very freeing not using it to drive around. My sense of\ndirection has noticeably improved, and I feel much more connected to the city\nI've lived in for nearly 5 years.\n\nFor road trips, I've started writing out directions on paper. Missing a turn\nused to be an annoying nuisance - now it's a fun puzzle game where I have to\nrearrange my instructions in my head! It feels like I'm in control, instead of\nmindlessly doing what a machine tells me to do.\n\nAt some point, I'm going to pick up a paper map. I haven't needed one yet, but\nI have a feeling it'll come in handy. In the summer, I tend to go on longer\nroad trips to much bigger cities like Montreal and Toronto. I'm excited to see\nhow well I do without my GPS!\n\n### 2FA\n\nMy Android phone had a FOSS TOTP app I used for authenticating my work VPN. To\nbe able to remove that device from my life, I needed an equivalent for my\nBlackberry. Luckily, it can run Java Micro Edition (Java ME) programs, and I\nfound one that does TOTP! TOTPME might look like it's from the 1990s, but I\nappreciate its minimalist UI. It works great and does what I need!\n\n### SMS and MMS\n\nFor normal texting, the Blackberry is fine. I find the keyboard a bit\ncumbersome (it's tiny, after all!) but I was never a fast typer on a modern\nphone either. One limitation is that there's no emoji support whatsoever - I'm\nlimited entirely to emoticons (-: It can be a bit annoying to get a text with\na black box and wonder what emoji they used - sometimes it can change the\nentire mood of the message!\n\nIt appears that I can receive images fine. Sending images is a different\nmatter. Some people can receive them, and some people can't. When it fails,\nit's completely silent - I don't get a notification, and neither does the\nreceiver!\n\n### Calls\n\nI do very little calling. I mean, I barely use my phone, but even compared to\nthat, I do very little calling. The microphone and speaker are fine, though\nthe phone does feel a little unergonomic. I wonder if my hand is just used to\nholding something larger.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nThis experiment has made me fairly confident I can forego a cellphone\nentirely. Sometimes I leave it at home when I go out, and I feel even more\nfree! It's kind of crazy how long I've been controlled by a brick. I do think\nthat I'll ditch my phone entirely in the near future. Even though it's an\nancient phone, it's running proprietary software, and I can be tracked via\ncell towers anyway. I need to get rid of it!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDowngrading my cellphone has done wonderful things for me. While there are\nlimitations, they are pretty minor, and the benefits are enormous. I feel more\nconnected to the world around me. I feel more in control! I was so sure I\nneeded a mobile device, for GPS at least, but really I didn't.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
