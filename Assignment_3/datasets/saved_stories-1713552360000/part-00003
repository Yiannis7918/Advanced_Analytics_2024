The estimated body length\nof ~ 11\u201315 m makes this new taxon (Vasuki indicus gen et sp. nov.) the largest\nknown madtsoiid snake, which thrived during a warm geological interval with\naverage temperatures estimated at ~ 28 \u00b0C. Phylogenetically, Vasuki forms a\ndistinct clade with the Indian Late Cretaceous taxon Madtsoia pisdurensis and\nthe North African Late Eocene Gigantophis garstini. Biogeographic\nconsiderations, seen in conjunction with its inter-relationship with other\nIndian and North African madtsoiids, suggest that Vasuki represents a relic\nlineage that originated in India. Subsequent India-Asia collision at ~ 50 Ma\nled to intercontinental dispersal of this lineage from the subcontinent into\nNorth Africa through southern Eurasia.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Skeleton of a Cretaceous mammal from Madagascar reflects long-term\ninsularity\n\nArticle 29 April 2020\n\nDavid W.

Bicknell & Stephen Pates\n\n## Introduction\n\nMadtsoiidae are an extinct clade of primarily Gondwanan terrestrial snakes\nwith a temporal range spanning about 100 Myr from the Late Cretaceous\u2013Late\nPleistocene^1,2,3. Their geographic range during the Late Cretaceous\nencompassed Madagascar, South America, India, Africa and the European\narchipelago^1,4,5,6,7,8,9. The Cenozoic forms are restricted to North Africa,\nSouth America, the Indian subcontinent and\nAustralia^2,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Madtsoiids display a broad spectrum of\nbody-sizes and include some of the largest known terrestrial snakes that ever\nlived^2,7,9. Although a speciose clade, most taxa are known exclusively from\nvertebrae, resulting in poorly constrained in-group relationships^2,8,16.\nAdditionally, the phylogenetic position of Madtsoiidae within Ophidia has\nremained contentious, as some studies recover it within Serpentes whereas\nothers place it outside the crown group^3,9,17,18,19,20. These phylogenetic\nuncertainties have hampered our understanding of madtsoiid biogeography and\nradiation events^2,8.\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent, Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) madtsoiids are\nknown from the Deccan volcanic province, including the large-sized Madtsoia\npisdurensis from the Lameta Formation^6,8. Among Tertiary madtsoiids,\nindeterminate forms are known from the early Paleocene Khadro Formation\n(Pakistan^16) and the early Eocene Cambay Shale (India^15). The latter also\nyielded the large madtsoiid Platyspondylophis^21. The Eocene and Late\nOligocene records include indeterminate taxa from Kutch and Ladakh,\nrespectively^14,22. Here we report the discovery of a giant madtsoiid snake,\none of largest snakes ever reported, from an interval corresponding to a warm\nMiddle Eocene period (~ 47 Ma) of India. Fossils were collected from an early\nLutetian grey shale unit from Panandhro Lignite Mine, Kutch, Gujrat State,\nwestern India (Supplementary Note 1, Fig. 1), and includes an excellently\npreserved, partial vertebral column. The discovery of a giant Eocene snake has\nimportant implications for madtsoiid biogeography in the context of Gondwanan\ninter-continental dispersal, and the evolution of large body-sizes possibly\ndriven by high temperatures in the Middle Eocene tropical zones.\n\nFigure 1\n\nGeological map of Kutch Basin showing fossil locality (a); stratigraphic\ncolumn at Panandhro Lignite Mine showing the position of madtsoiid snake-\nyielding horizon with age diagnostic dinoflagellate cyst assemblage and \u03b4^13C\ncurve marking hyperthermal event ETM2 (modified after Agrawal et al.^23) (b);\npanoramic view of the fossil site (c).

Such vertebral dimensions are usually found in large-bodied\nmadtsoiids such as, Gigantophis^2; Yurlunggur^11, Madtsoia^1,10,13, and\nWonambi^25. Moreover, the closure of vertebral sutures suggests these\nspecimens likely reached skeletal maturity, similar for instance to Madtsoia\npisdurensis^8.\n\nVasuki is characterized by exceptionally large vertebrae where centrum length\n(cL) and prezygapophyseal width (prW) range between 37.5\u201362.7 and 62.4\u2013111.4\nmm, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). We recognize this as an autapomorphy\nsince these proportions eclipse all large-sized madtsoiids [Madtsoia (cL =\n18\u201325 mm; prW = 35\u201365 mm; LaDuke et al.^1), Gigantophis (cL = 28\u201341 mm; prW =\n44\u201366 mm; Rio and Mannion^2), Platyspondylophis (cL = 18\u201321 mm; prW = 26\u201343\nmm; Smith et al.^21) and Yurlunggur (cL = 15\u201322 mm; prW = 19\u201341 mm)]. Some\ncaution, however, is warranted here because of uncertainties as to whether the\nlargest size of these large-bodied madtsoiids has been captured, although, the\nsame is true for Vasuki.\n\nIn overall form, the vertebrae of the new Indian taxon are massive (prW >> cL)\nand comprise a procoelous centrum. Anteriorly, the centrum preserves an\nanteroventrally inclined cotyle, whereas the posterior condyle is deflected\nposterodorsally resulting in considerable visibility of the condyle and cotyle\nin dorsal and ventral views, respectively (Fig. 2C,E). In anterior view, the\ncotyle is strongly concave with its ventral margin recessed relative to the\ndorsal. The cotyle is mediolaterally wider than dorsoventrally high (Figs. 2P,\n3A,F,K; IITR/VPL/SB 3102-4, coW/coH = 1.2; Supplementary Table 2) as in all\nmadtsoiids [e.g., Gigantophis garstini^2 (NHMUK R8344, coW/coH = 1.2),\nMadtsoia madagascariensis (FMNH PR 2551, coW/coH = 1.24) Yurlunggur (NTM\nP8695-243, coW/coH = 1.22), and Wonambi (QMF23038, coW/coH = 1.4]. Laterally,\nthe cotyle is bordered on each side by a well-developed and moderately deep\nparacotylar fossa (Figs. 2K,P, 3A,K). The dorsal and ventral margins of the\nfossa are prominent and defined by bony struts emanating from the dorsolateral\nand lateral cotylar margins, respectively. The lateral margin of the fossa,\nhowever, is flush with the surface. Furthermore, in some specimens the\nparacotylar fossa is divided into a shallower dorsal and deeper ventral sub-\nfossa by a weak secondary strut extending laterally from the dorsolateral\nmargin of the cotyle. A tiny paracotylar foramen is present on the dorsal-most\npart of one or both paracotylar fossae, immediately lateral to the neural\ncanal (Figs. 2F,K,P, 3A,K). While the presence of paracotylar fossae and\nforamina is a synapomorphy of Madtsoiidae^16,26, the exact morphology of these\nfeatures is variable across the clade. \u201cGigantophis sp.\u201d (CPAG-RANKT-V-1),\nMenarana nosymena and Adinophis fisaka (FMNH PR 2572) differ from Vasuki in\nthe presence of paired paracotylar foramina on each side^1,16,27. In Madtsoia\nand Eomadtsoia (MPEF-PV 2378) the foramina are deep and comparatively large,\nwhereas in Yurlunggur these occur in clusters^7,8,10,11,13. Eomadtsoia,\nhowever, shares with Vasuki the presence of prominent ventral rim of the\nparacotylar fossa^7. In Gigantophis garstini the paracotylar fossa lacks a\nventral margin and in Platyspondylophis the paracotylar foramen is absent\naltogether^2,21.\n\nThe posterior condyle is transversely wider than high (IITR/VPL/SB 3102\u20134,\ncnW/cnH = 1.2; Supplementary Table 2) with the width progressively increasing\nfrom ATV (Fig. 2B,G; cnW/cnH = 1.1) to MTV (Fig. 3G, Q; cnW/cnH = 1.2\u20131.3).\nSimilar proportions of the posterior condyle characterize most madtsoiids\n[e.g., Nidophis (LPB FGGUB v.547/3, ATV, cnW/cnH = 1.1; LPB FGGUB v.547/1,\nMTV, cnW/cnH = 1.2); Gigantophis garstini (NHMUK R8344, MTV, cnW/cnH = 1.2 Rio\nand Mannio^2); Madtsoia camposi (DGM 1310b, MTV, cnW/cnH = 1.3] (Fig. 3G,I,Q).\nFurthermore, in posterior view, two small, distinct fossae are discernible on\nthe lateral surface of the centrum immediately posterior to the left\ndiapophysis (Fig. 3G,I,Q). The fossae are vertically arranged, on top of each\nother, and separated by a prominent ridge. Whether these unilateral fossae\nrepresent an individual condition or a general feature cannot be currently\nascertained and will require additional specimens of Vasuki.\n\nThe synapophysis is dorsoventrally high and comprises a distinct diapophysis\nand parapophysis (Figs. 2M,R, 3C,R) unlike in Gigantophis garstini, Madtsoia\nmadagascariensis, and Madtsoia pisdurensis^1,2,8. In anterior view, the\norientation of the synapophysis changes from ventrolateral (Fig. 2F,K) to\nsomewhat laterally facing (Fig. 3K,P,U) across the precloacal series. This\nchange is marked by an increase in the synapophyseal angle (\u03b1), with the\nhorizontal, from ATV (\u03b1 = avg. 56.6\u00b0) to MTV (\u03b1 = avg. 71.5\u00b0). A narrower\nsynapophyseal angle was observed in most of the comparative madtsoiid taxa\nincluding Eomadtsoia [MPEF-PV 2378 (MTV), \u03b1 = 45\u00b0], Gigantophis garstini\n[NHMUK R8344 (MTV) \u03b1 = 48], Madtsoia madagascariensis [FMNH PR 2549 (ATV), \u03b1 =\n47\u00b0; FMNH PR 2551 (MTV), \u03b1 = 56\u00b0], \u201cGigantophis sp.\u201d [CPAG-RANKT-V-1 (MTV), \u03b1\n= 56\u00b0], Madtsoia camposi [DGM 1310c (MTV), \u03b1 = 57\u00b0], Wonambi [QMF23038 (MTV) \u03b1\n= 58\u00b0] and Madtsoia bai [AMNH 3155 (MTV), \u03b1 = 62\u00b0]. In lateral view, the\nsynapophysis is inclined at (\u03b2) 20\u00b0\u201327\u00b0 from the vertical in Vasuki. This is\nsimilar to Wonambi [QMF23038, \u03b2 = 25\u00b0], Nanowana [QMF19741, \u03b2 = ~ 25\u00b0],\nMadtsoia camposi [DGM 1310c, \u03b2 = 26\u00b0] and Yurlunggur [P8695, \u03b2 = 22\u00b0\u201326\u00b0]. In\ncontrast, wider angles characterize Gigantophis garstini [NHMUK R8344, \u03b2 =\n30\u00b0^2], Platyspondylophis [\u03b2 = 30\u00b0\u201335\u00b0], Madtsoia madagascariensis [FMNH PR\n2549, \u03b2 = 33\u00b0] and \u201cGigantophis sp.\u201d [CPAG-RANKT-V-1, \u03b2 = ~ 90\u00b0], whereas in\nPatagniophis [\u03b2 = 7\u00b0\u20139\u00b0], Powellophis [PVL 4714\u20134, \u03b2 = 18\u00b0] and Madtsoia\npisdurensis [225/GSI/PAL/CR/10, \u03b2 = 12\u00b0] the angles are narrower.\n\nAn arcuate paracotylar notch (sensu LaDuke et al.^1), between the ventral\ncotylar rim and the parapophysis, is consistently present in all specimens\n(Fig. 2A,F). The parapophysis comprises a sub-rectangular facet, in lateral\nview, and extends below the ventral cotylar rim in ATV (Fig. 2F,H,P,R). In MTV\nit lies dorsal to the ventral cotylar rim (Fig. 3F,P) unlike Madtsoia\npisdurensis and Gigantophis garstini where the parapophyseal base is ventral\nand in level with the ventral cotylar rim, respectively^2,8. The diapophysis\nis bulbous and extends laterally beyond the prezygapophysis (Figs. 2F,H,\n3P,R), contrary to Powellophis^3, Patagoniophis australiensis^28, Madtsoia\npisdurensis^8, Madtsoia madagascariensis^1 and Nidophis^9. The dorsal margin\nof the diapophysis remains ventral to the dorsal cotylar margin in ATV (Fig.\n2A,F), but becomes level with the dorsoventral midpoint of the neural canal in\nMTV (Fig. 3K,P). A similar disposition of the MTV diapophysis is observed in\nMadtsoia madagascariensis, Madtsoia camposi, Wonambi barriei and\nAdinophis^1,2,13,27. The dorsal diapophyseal margin lies between the ventral\nmargin of the neural canal and the dorsoventral midpoint of the cotyle in\n\u201cGigantophis sp.\u201d^16, Gigantophis garstini^2, Nidophis^9, Yurlunggur^11 and\nPowellophis^3. In Platyspondylophis the diapophysis extends beyond the ventral\nmargin of the neural canal in all preserved precloacal vertebrae^21.\n\nThe prezygapophyseal buttress is massive, lacks a prezygapophyseal process and\nbears an oblique, blunt ridge anteriorly (Fig. 2F,K). In lateral view, the\nbuttress is succeeded posteriorly by an elliptical fossa (Fig. 2C,H,R). The\nfossa occurs immediately ventral to the interzygapophyseal ridge and medial to\nthe diapophysis, similar to Madtsoia pisdurensis (Mohabey et al.^8). The\nprezygapophyseal facets are elliptical (5022\u20134, przL/przW = 1.3) and inclined\nventromedially (pr\u03b1 = 20\u00b0\u201328\u00b0; Fig. 2A,D,F,I). In dorsal view, these facets\ndiverge at 45\u00b0 from the sagittal plane, contrary to the transversely oriented\nfacets in Madtsoia bai^10, Madtsoia madagascariensis^1, Platyspondylophis^21,\nand Yurlunggur^11. Strongly divergent prezygapophyses are also observed in\nGigantophis garstini^2 (~ 70\u00b0) and Eomadtsoia^7 (60\u00b0\u201380\u00b0). The\npostzygapophyseal facets in Vasuki are also elliptical (IITR/VPL/SB 3102-8II,\npozL/pozW = 1.2; Supplementary Table 2) and medioventrally oriented (po\u03b1 =\n12\u00b0\u201326\u00b0; Figs. 2G,J, 3B,E). The interzygapophyseal ridge is thick and\nposterodorsally directed, acting as a bridge between the pre- and\npostzygapophyses. A small lateral foramen is present ventral to the ridge\n(Fig. 3L,Q) as in Powellophis^3. In dorsal view the interzygapophyseal ridges\nare straight and differ from the arcuate ridges seen in most madtsoiids [e.g.,\nMadtsoia, Gigantophis garstini, Wonambi, Yurlunggur and\nPlatyspondylophis]^2,8,10,11,13,18,21,28.\n\nThe neural canal is reniform (Figs. 2P,Q, 3F,G) in cross-section and\nsignificantly wider than high (ncW/ncH = 3\u20133.6). It differs from the\ncomparatively narrower and trilobate neural canal in Gigantophis garstini^2\n(NHMUK R8344, ncW/ncH = 2.3), Platyspondylophis (WIF/A 2271, ncW/ncH = 2.1),\nMadtsoia (ncW/ncH = 1.3\u20132.3), Yurlunggur (NTM P8695-243, ncW/ncH = 2.3),\n\u201cGigantophis sp.\u201d (CPAG-RANKT-V-1, ncW/ncH = 1.8) and Powellophis (PVL 4714\u20134,\nncW/ncH = 1.6), and the sub-elliptical canal in Wonambi (QMF23038, ncW/ncH =\n1.3).\n\nThe zygosphene is trapezoidal and mediolaterally wider than high (zsW/zsH =\n1.4\u20131.8; Fig. 2A,K), as in Gigantophis garstini (NHMUK R8344, zsW/zsH = 2^2),\nMadtsoia bai (AMNH 3155, zsW/zsH = 1.8) and Madtsoia madagascariensis (FMNH PR\n2551, zsW/zsH = 1.9). Transversely much wider zygosphenes characterize\nNidophis (LPB FGGUB v.547/1, zsW/zsH = 5), Madtsoia camposi (DGM 1310a,\nzsW/zsH = 2.8), Eomadtsoia (MPEF-PV 2378, zsW/zsH = 2.6), Platyspondylophis\n(WIF/A 2269, zsW/zsH = 2.2) and Patagoniophis (QMF 19717, zsW/zsH = 5). In\nVasuki, the zygosphene is wider than the cotyle, contrary to Gigantophis\ngarstini, \u201cGigantophis sp.\u201d, Platyspondylophis and Madtsoia^1,8,10,13,16,21.\nIn anterior view, dorsal margin of the zygosphene is straight and the\narticular facets are steeply inclined (~ 40\u00b0 form the vertical; Figs. 2F,P,\n3A). These facets are oval in lateral view (IITR/VPL/SB 3102\u20136, zsfL/zsfW =\n1.1). The anterior zygosphenal margin is markedly notched in dorsal view (zs\u03b1\n= 118\u00b0\u2013128\u00b0; Figs. 2I,N, 3N), and differs from the non-notched zygosphene in\nMadtsoia pisdurensis^8, Madtsoia camposi^13, Eomadtsoia^7 and\nPlatyspondylophis^21. In \u201cGigantophis sp.\u201d (zs\u03b1 = 145\u00b0) and Madtsoia\nmadagascariensis (zs\u03b1 = 145\u00b0\u2013147\u00b0) the zygosphene is weakly notched.\n\nThe zygantrum is mediolaterally wider than high, with steeply inclined facets\n(50\u00b0\u201360\u00b0 from the horizontal; Fig. 2B,G,Q). The facets are elliptical in\nposterior view, but devoid of a median wall present in Gigantophis garstini^2.\nAn anteroventrally directed fossa is present at the base of each facet, and\naccommodates an endozygantral foramen (Figs. 2G, 3B). The latter is also\npresent in Madtsoia madagascariensis^1, Powellophis^3 and Gigantophis\ngarstini^2. In Vasuki, the zygantral roof above each facet is medio-dorsally\nconvex and descends as sub-vertical ridges into the zygantrum (Fig. 2Q) as in\nMadtsoia madagascariensis^1. The roof is ventrally convex in Eomadtsoia and\nMadtsoia pisdurensis, and straight in Powellophis, Platyspondylophis,\nYurlunggur and Gigantophis garstini^3,7,8,11,21. A large, dorsolaterally\noriented, elliptical parazygantral fossa flanks the zygantrum laterally on\neither side and bears a small parazygantral foramina (Fig. 2B,G,Q).\n\nThe neural spine is dorsoventrally high (MTV, nsH/tvH = 0.21\u20130.29,\nSupplementary Table 2) and buttressed posteriorly by the neural arch laminae\n(Fig. 3B\u2013D,V,W). The latter extend anterodorsally from the dorsolateral margin\nof the postzygapophyses up to the dorsal spinal margin, resulting in a deep\nmedian embayment. In lateral view, the spine is steeply inclined\nposterodorsally (12\u00b0\u201319\u00b0 from the vertical) with a concave anterior and a\nstraight posterior margin. While a high neural spine characterizes most large\nmadtsoiids [Madtsoia camposi (DGM, 1310b, MTV, nsH/tvH = 0.22), Madtsoia\nmadagascariensis (FMNH PR 2551, MTV, nsH/tvH = 0.33), Madtsoia bai (AMNH 3154,\nMTV, nsH/tvH = 0.22), Wonambi (QMF23038, MTV, nsH/tvH = 0.27)], it is more\ngently inclined in these large-sized taxa [e.g., Madtsoia madagascariensis\n(27\u00b0\u201333\u00b0), Wonambi (30\u00b0), Gigantophis garstini (30\u00b0)]. A convex anterior\nmargin in Madtsoia madagascariensis as well as Powellophis and Nanowana\nfurther distinguishes them from Vasuki. Furthermore, the presence of a sharp\npostspinal lamina (sensu Tschopp^29) on the posterior spinal surface and a\nspade-shaped cross-section of the spine differentiates Vasuki from other\nmadtsoiids (Figs. 2D,S, 3D). In dorsal view, the neural spine base is flanked\non either side by a prominent fossa (Fig. 2I,S), as in Madtsoia pisdurensis^8\nand Madtsoia madagascariensis^1. The fossae occur immediately posterior to the\nzygosphene and are bordered ventrally by weak, rounded bony struts emanating\nfrom the posterolateral zygosphenal margin. Ventral to these struts, a\nprominent foramen is present on the dorsal surface of the neural arch\nposterior to the zygosphene (Fig. 2I), similar to Madtsoia madagascariensis^1.\n\nIn ventral view, the centrum is triangular and widest across the parapophyses.\nLarge paired subcentral fossae, more prominent in the anterior trunk vertebrae\n(ATV), occupy most of the ventral surface of the centrum (Figs. 2J,O, 3E,T).\nThe fossae are bordered laterally by robust subcentral ridges that extend\nposteromedially from the parapophyses to the dorsoventral midpoint of the\ncondyle. These ridges are straight to weakly convex in ventral view and differ\nfrom the concave ridges in Patagoniophis^28 and Madtsoia madagascariensis^1.\nThe subcentral fossae are separated by a transversely convex low hemal keel\n(Figs. 2T, 3E,O,T). The latter is broad, weakly raised and terminates anterior\nto the precondylar constriction. The hemal keel is not prominent, unlike the\nnarrow/sharp keel in \u201cGigantophis sp.\u201d, Eomadtsoia, Nidophis, Nanowana and\nPowellophis^2,3,7,9,16. In Vasuki, this keel remains dorsal to the ventral\nparapophyseal margin (Figs. 2M,R, 3M,R,V) unlike the hemal keel of other\nmadtsoiids which descends below the parapophysis. Consequently, we identify\nthe disposition of the hemal keel as an autapomorphy of Vasuki.\n\nA small subcentral foramen is present on either side of the ventral shaft in\nVasuki (Fig. 2E,O,T), as in Madtsoia madagascariensis^1, Madtsoia camposi^13,\nNidophis^9, and Patagoniophis^28. The hypapophysis is paddle-like with sharp\nlateral margins and extends up to the level of the ventral condylar rim in ATV\n(Fig. 2G,H,J,L,M,O). The hypapophysis is directed posteroventrally unlike the\nventrally directed hypapophysis in Madtsoia madagascariensis^1 and\nPatagoniophis^28. Across the precloacals, the hypapophysis progressively\nreduces in prominence and is replaced by a chisel shaped structure with paired\nprotuberances separated from the ventral condylar rim by a short, sharp ridge\nin the mid-trunk vertebrae (MTV; Fig. 3J,O,T,X). This chisel shaped structure\nappears autapomorphic for Vasuki as it differs from the condition in other\nmadtsoiids.\n\n### Phylogenetic analysis\n\nThe position of Vasuki within Madtsoiidae was tested in a modified version of\nthe character-taxon matrix of Zaher et al.^30 (Analysis 1; see \u201cMethods\u201d\nsection and Supplementary Note 2). 50 most parsimonious trees were recovered\nwith a tree length of 1610, consistency index (CI) of 0.386 and retention\nindex (RI) of 0.73. The resultant tree topologies are largely consistent with\nZaher et al.^30 as Madtsoiidae was recovered as a distinct clade within crown\nSerpentes (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 3). Madtsoiidae, however, was poorly\nresolved and did not provide insights into the inter-relationship of Vasuki\nwith the other members of the clade. The poor resolution is likely a\nreflection of the absence of cranial material in majority of madtsoiids and a\nfunction of the large matrix where very few vertebral characters could be\nscored for most madtsoiid taxa. We, therefore, ran a second analysis (Analysis\n2) by removing all non-madtsoiid Serpentes and combining the cranial and\nvertebral characters of Zaher et al.^30 and Garberoglio et al.^3, respectively\n(see \u201cMethods\u201d section and Supplementary Note 3). The latter dataset was used\nbecause as the study focused on madtsoiid ingroup relationships. Our analysis\nrecovered only two most parsimonious trees with a tree length of 191, CI of\n0.634 and RI of 0.62. Both trees (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 4) were mostly\nwell resolved and the resultant topologies largely consistent with recent\nstudies^2,3,7 on madtsoiid inter-relationships. Madtsoiidae shows size-based\nclustering with the small (< 2 m) and medium\u2013large bodied (> 3 m) taxa\nrecovered as separate clades (Fig. 5). Vasuki is nested within a distinct\nclade (Bremer support = 3) as a sister taxon to Indian Late Cretaceous\nMadtsoia pisdurensis + North African Late Eocene Gigantophis garstini.\n\nFigure 4\n\nPhylogenetic position of Vasuki indicus gen. et sp. nov.

In these methods TBL was regressed on the postzygapophyseal width\n(following Head et al.^31; Rio and Mannion^2) and the prezygapophyseal width\n(= trans-prezygapophyseal width; following McCartney et al.^32, Garberoglio et\nal.^3), respectively. In the present study estimates were made from MTV\n(IITR/VPL/SB 3102-4, 3102-8I\u2013II, 3102-11II\u2013III), the largest specimens in the\ncollection, following Rio and Mannion^2, McCartney et al.^32 and Garberoglio\net al.^3. Both regression models were statistically significant (p < 0.05) and\nhad a high explanatory power (r^2 = 0.83\u20130.96) which asserts their validity.\nThe TBL estimates following Head et al.^31 ranges between 10.9 and 12.2 m\n(Fig. 6A,B), whereas those following McCartney et al.^32 is between 14.5 and\n15.2 m (Fig. 7A). These estimates, however, should be treated with caution as\nthe collection lacks posterior precloacal and cloacal vertebrae, and an\nunderstanding of the intracolumnar variation in madtsoiids is currently non-\nexistent.\n\nFigure 6\n\nRegressions of vertebral metrics on total body length in extant boine taxa.\nRegression of postygapophyseal width on total body length in extant boine taxa\nfrom vertebrae 60% posteriorly along the vertebral column; p = 0.00000003,\nstandard error = \u00b1 0.3 m (a). Regression of postygapophyseal width on total\nbody length in extant boine taxa from vertebrae 65% posteriorly along the\nvertebral column; p = 0.00000001, standard error = \u00b1 0.2 m (b).

Estimated body lengths of Vasuki indicus shown in red. p =\n0.000000000000003; standard error = \u00b1 0.09 m.\n\nFull size image\n\nIt is worth noting that the largest body-length estimates of Vasuki appear to\nexceed that of Titanoboa, even though the vertebral dimensions of the Indian\ntaxon are slightly smaller than those of Titanoboa. We acknowledge that this\nobservation may be a reflection of the different datasets used to formulate\nthe predictive equations. However, we do not disregard the results based on\nthe dataset of MacCartney et al.^32, since the equations derived from the\ndataset of Head et al.^31 involve measurements of extant boine taxa that are\ntaken from vertebrae 60\u201365% posteriorly along the column. Caution is warranted\nhere because of the uncertainties surrounding the phylogenetic position of\nMadtsoiidae relative to crown snakes which make estimations based on a model\ndepicting intracolumnar variation in vertebral morphology of a particular\nextant family/taxa tentative. Consequently, predictive regression equations\nfollowing McCartney et al.^32, which comprise vertebral data from an array of\nextant snakes, are also considered in our study.\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Phylogenetic implications\n\nThe analyses presented here recovered a monophyletic Madtsoiidae with the\nclade placed within crown Serpentes in Analysis 1 (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig.\n3). This is in accordance with most phylogenetic studies which assessed the\nrelationship of snake total group within Squamata^30,33,34,35. Furthermore,\nsimilar to Zaher et al.^30, the tree topology in Analysis 1 recovered Sanajeh,\nDiniliysia, Najash stemward of crown Serpentes. Although the clade Madtsoiidae\nremains poorly resolved in Analysis 1, we found a combination of five\nsynapomorphies supporting the placement of Vasuki within Madtsoiidae [centrum\nbroad and subtriangular (ch 613); deep V-shaped embayment along posterior\nmargin of neural arch (ch 614); presence of well-developed paracotylar\nforamina (ch 615); absence of prezygapophyseal accessory process (ch 616);\npresence of parazygantral foramina (ch 617)].\n\nOn the other hand, Analysis 2 gave insights into the ingroup relationships of\nMadtsoiidae (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 4). The resultant topologies are\nlargely comparable with previous phylogenetic results^2,3,7,9, as the taxa\nwere found to resolve into two size-based clades (large vs small). While the\npossibility of size-related features driving such groupings cannot be ruled\nout, the recovery of small\u2013medium sized taxa (e.g., Adinophis, Menarana,\nPowellophis) within the large bodied clade suggests the presence of size-\nindependent characters supporting these clades. A similar argument was also\nput forward by Garberoglio et al.^3 while discussing the occurrence of size-\nbased clades within Madtsoiidae. However, none of the speciose genera (e.g.,\nMadtsoia, Nanowana, Menarana) included in this study formed monophyletic\nclades. The Bremer support for most internal nodes within Madtsoiidae remains\nlow, although a few have comparatively higher support (Fig. 5). These results\nhighlight the need for more rigorous sampling involving a better anatomical\ncoverage of madtsoiids, leading to more robust phylogenetic relationships.\n\nA unique combination of 7 synapomorphies nest Vasuki within Madtsoiidae [well-\ndeveloped paracotylar foramina (ch 610); median prominence on ventral margin\nof centrum (ch 611); coW:dW between 0.5 and 0.3 (ch 634); lateral ridge on\nprecloacal vertebrae below lateral foramen (ch 635); thick zygosphene (ch\n645); moderately high neural spine (ch 648); lateral foramina present dorsal\nto subcentral ridges (ch 650)]. Furthermore, a combination of 6 unambiguous\nsynapomorphies [posterior neural arch margin with deep V-shaped embayment (ch\n614); oval precloacal cotyle (ch 615); transversely wide vertebrae (ch 629);\nhemal keel not sharp and narrow (ch 633); neural spine posteriorly canted (ch\n652); presence of posterior process of hemal keel (ch 653)] support the\nplacement of Vasuki with Gigantophis garstini and Madtsoia pisdurensis.\nMoreover, a single autapomorphy characterises Vasuki\u2014chisel-shaped process of\nhemal keel (ch 654).\n\nIt is noteworthy that some of the synapomorphies mentioned above may be\nindividually plesiomorphic characters, it is the unique combination of\ncharacters that justifies the recovery of Vasuki within Madtsoiidae. Previous\nstudies (e.g., Head et al.^31; Mohabey et al.^8) have used character\ncombinations to diagnose Madtsoiidae and other snake taxa.\n\n### Body length estimation and paleoecology\n\nOur TBL estimations show that Vasuki was not only the largest madtsoiid (Table\n1) but one of the largest snakes ever reported. Its vertebral dimensions are\nsecond only to the Paleocene Boinae Titanoboa (Head et al.^31). We attempted\nto infer the paleoecology of this large Indian madtsoiid from vertebral\nmorphology since several previous studies on other extinct snakes (e.g.,\nPalaeophis colossaeus, Powellophis and Madtsoia madagascarensis) have\nhighlighted the importance of vertebrae in paleoecological\nreconstructions^1,3,32. The transversely wide vertebrae of Vasuki bear mainly\nlaterally-directed synapophyses which would have been associated with\nlaterally directed ribs, suggesting a broad and cylindrical body (see\nMcCartney et al.^32). These features suggest a non-aquatic lifestyle for\nVasuki as opposed to aquatic snakes which may possess high pterapophyses and\nhave laterally compressed vertebrae with ventrally facing synapophyses,\nthereby placing the ribs beneath the vertebrae^3,32,36. A high pterapophysis,\nhowever, is absent in many aquatic snakes and changes in the orientation of\nsynapophyses from ventral to lateral across the vertebral column have been\npreviously noted in aquatic snakes such as Simoliophis^37. In hydrophiine sea\nsnakes the vertebrae show true lateral compression only in the caudal region.\nTherefore, the possibility of an aquatic lifestyle for this giant Indian\nmadtsoiid cannot be completely ruled out. An arboreal lifestyle is unlikely,\njudging from the large size of Vasuki and the fact that arboreal snakes tend\nto have elongated vertebrae with short zygapophyses^38. A non-fossorial\nhabitat is inferred here for Vasuki based on large body-size and non-depressed\nneural arch-spine complexes which would have placed the dorsal muscles (e.g.,\nM. Semispinalis et spinalis, M. Interarticularis superior) away from the\nsagittal plane (sensu Auffenburg^39)^1,3. This is further supported by the\ninferred presence of dorsoventrally thick M. multifidus, which originates from\nthe anterodorsal neural spinal surface and inserts anteriorly onto the\nposterior margin of the neural arch laminae of the preceding vertebra. Gross\nsimilarity in vertebral morphology with extant large-bodied pythonids (e.g.,\nPython and Malayopython)^40 suggests a terrestrial/semi-aquatic paleohabitat\nfor Vasuki. Corroborative evidence comes from the depositional environment of\nthe Vasuki-yielding horizon, which was reconstructed as a back swamp\nmarsh^23,41,42,43,44,45, similar to the habitat of modern large pythonids.\n\nTable 1 Comparison of body length estimates of Vasuki indicus and other large-\nbodied matdsoiids.\n\nFull size table\n\nVasuki is envisaged as a slow-moving snake that possibly adopted a rectilinear\nlocomotory mechanism as indicated by its large size, anteroposteriorly short\nand transversely wide vertebrae and absence of accessory prezygapophyseal\nprocesses^1,38,46. A similar, anatomy-based inference was also drawn for the\nlarge Malagasy Madtsoia madagascariensis^1, although rectilinear locomotion\nhas also been documented in extant snakes with well-developed prezygapophyseal\nprocesses, such as vipers^47. In spite of the uncertainties associated with\nthe locomotory mechanism of Vasuki, it was perhaps too large to be an active\nforager and was more likely an ambush predator that would subdue its prey\nthrough constriction, similar to modern anacondas and large-bodied\npythonids^1,42,48.\n\nThe new Indian madtsoiid suggests a relatively warm climate (~ 28 \u00b0C) for the\nMiddle Eocene (early Lutetian) paleogeographic position of India within the\ntropical zone^49,50. This inference stems mainly from empirically derived\ndependence of poikilotherm body temperature on the ambient environmental\ntemperature, which in turn controls the maximum body size^31,32,51. Following\nHead et al.^31, the mean annual paleotemperature (MAPT) for the Middle Eocene\nwas estimated based on a relationship between the present mean annual\ntemperature (MAT), TBL difference between Vasuki and reticulated python\n(Malayopython reticulatus, the longest known extant snake)^42 and the mass-\nspecific metabolic rate of pythons (see \u201cMethods\u201d section). The predicted MAPT\nfalls between 27.2 and 28.6 \u00b0C, corresponding to the temperature range\nnecessary for the survival of an 11\u201315 m snake, and suggests the Middle Eocene\ntropics were 0.7\u20132.1 \u00b0C (\u0394T) warmer than at present (MAT = 26.5 \u00b0C^52). These\nestimates are largely comparable to those for the Palaeocene and Late\nCretaceous based on the extinct Titanoboa (\u0394T = 1.9\u20133.7 \u00b0C) and the frog\nBeelzebufo ampinga (\u0394T = 2.1 \u00b0C), respectively^52. Studies based on \u03b4^18O\nisotopic ratios from foraminifera and TEX86 index^53,54,55,56 have predicted\nhigh tropical sea surface temperatures (\u2265 30 \u00b0C) during the Middle Eocene at ~\n47 Ma, whereas some estimates suggest tropical cooling for the early Middle\nand Late Eocene, but particularly during 45\u201334Ma^57,58. The paleotemperature\ninferred here (< 30 \u00b0C) are lower than the afore-mentioned estimates (\u2265 30\n\u00b0C), but suggests that the Middle Eocene (early Lutetian, ~ 47 Ma) climate was\nwarmer than at present.\n\nA possible limitation of this study could be the use of a pythonid\n(Malayopython reticulatus) as the modern analog, especially since Pythonoidae\nand Madtsoiidae are phylogenetically distant. However, our choice of a modern\nanalog is based on the inferred foraging mode and terrestrial/semi-aquatic\npaleohabitat of Vasuki, using anatomical data and the depositional environment\nof the fossiliferous horizon. The latter are similar to those of modern large\npythonids which known to inhabit swamps, marshes and lowland\nforests^41,42,43,45.\n\nIn India, Paleogene hyperthermal events, such as PETM and ETM2 are well\ndocumented from the Kutch and Cambay basins of western India based on \u03b4^13C\nnegative excursions^23,59,60,61. In comparison, studies on Paleogene\npaleotemperatures are scarce. Based on oxygen isotopic ratios, temperatures in\nexcess of 30 \u00b0C were determined for the late Paleocene and early Eocene,\nwhereas lower temperatures, ranging between 22 and 28 \u00b0C, were reported for\nthe Middle\u2013Late Eocene (~ 45\u201337 Ma)^62,63. Our new estimates show that while\nthe paleoclimate during the Middle Eocene (~ 47 Ma) became cooler compared to\nthe Late Paleocene and early Eocene, it was still higher than at present.\nFurther studies on Paleogene climates in the context of squamate speciation\nand extinction pattern are necessary in view of their suggested correlation\nwith temperature patterns^64,65,66.\n\n### Paleobiogeography\n\nMadtsoiids were a major group of terrestrial snakes whose temporal range\nstraddles the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary. Fossil occurrences depict a\nskewed distribution of these snakes as most taxa are known from the Gondwanan\nlandmasses, except Antarctica^1,2 (Figs. 8, 9). The Laurasian record is\nextremely poor with madtsoiids known only from the Late Cretaceous (upper\nCampanian\u2013Maastrichtian) of southern Europe^9. The distributional pattern also\nshows the appearance of taxa on landmasses which were separated during the\nLate Cretaceous and Cenozoic but which share close phylogenetic relations\nindicating biogeographic links (sensu LaDuke et al.^1). This conundrum is\naptly illustrated by the presence of Madtsoia in the Late Cretaceous\n(Maastrichtian) of Madagascar and India and the Early Paleogene of South\nAmerica, and Menarana in the Maastrichtian of Madagascar and Spain^1,8 (Fig.\n8). Previous studies put forward multiple scenarios for madtsoiid\npaleobiogeography including\u2014a pan-Gondwanan distribution, albeit unsampled,\nduring the Early Cretaceous followed by regional extinctions and/vicariance;\npresence of land bridges allowing dispersal between different Gondwanan\nlandmasses and to Europe; sweepstakes dispersal between continents separated\nby oceanic barriers^1,8,9. However, Rio and Mannion^2 argued in favour of an\nearly pan-Gondwanan distribution and trans-Tethyan dispersals between Africa\nand Europe in the Late Cretaceous. The new Middle Eocene Indian madtsoiid\nfurther adds to the complexity of madtsoiid biogeography owing to its close\nphylogenetic ties with the Late Cretaceous Madtsoia pisdurensis from India and\nthe Late Eocene North African Gigantophis garstini (Figs. 5, 8).\n\nFigure 8\n\nTime-calibrated phylogenetic tree, based on the 50% majority-rule tree of Fig.\n5.

Source of information on\nmadtsoiid distribution from the Paleobiology database (https://www.paleo-\nbiodb.org/).\n\nFull size image\n\nTo assess the biogeographic significance of Vasuki we constructed a time-\ncalibrated phylogenetic tree since this approach has been widely used in\nseveral previous studies for evaluating the paleobiogeographic significance of\ndifferent vertebrate groups, including snakes and dinosaurs^2,67,68,69. The\nrationale behind this approach is that phylogenetic relations are widely\nconsidered to be suggestive of biogeographic ties^1,70,71,72. The phylogenetic\ntree used here is based on anatomically sparse data because most madtsoiid\ntaxa are known exclusively from vertebrae and lack cranial material, resulting\nin weak support (Bremer support) for a majority of internal nodes within\nMadtsoiidae. For this reason, we restricted our biogeographic interpretations\nonly to those nodes which had comparatively higher support (Bremer support \u2265\n2; Fig. 8). Overall, the paleobiogeographic scenarios presented here should be\ntreated with caution as future fossil discoveries may alter the phylogenetic\nposition of some madtsoiid taxa and, in turn, the present biogeographic\ninferences.\n\nNotwithstanding the above-mentioned limitations, the resultant tree in our\nstudy is consistent with the current consensus on madtsoiid origins as it\nsuggests a Gondwanan origin reflecting the fact that all known early-diverging\ntaxa are from erstwhile Gondwanan landmasses (Fig. 8). The tree topology\nargues for biotic exchanges between South America, Madagascar and Australia\nsince the Malagasy Madtsoia madagascariensis (Late Cretaceous) and the South\nAmerican Madtsoia bai (Eocene) are successive outgroups to the clade\ncomprising the Neogene Yurlunggur and Wonambi from Australia. Paleogeographic\nreconstructions depict fragmentation of most major Gondwana landmasses by the\nearly Cenomanian, with Indo-Madagascar separating from Australia\u2013Antarctica by\n~ 110 Ma^73,74,75. However, previous studies suggested that land connections\nbetween South America and Australia facilitating faunal dispersal through\nAntarctica persisted till the early Eocene^1,75 (Fig. 9). On the other hand,\nthe Malagasy\u2013South American\u2013Australian biotic link can likely be explained by\nthe presence of madtsoiids or their most recent common ancestors in these\ncontinental blocks prior to their break-up. Recent studies on madtsoiid\nbiogeography envisage an Early Cretaceous pan-Gondwana dispersal of these\nsnakes, with ghost lineages from time-calibrated trees predicting an Aptian\norigin of Madtsoiidae^1,2,8,9,19. The fossil record, however, is inconsistent\nwith the hypothesized Early Cretaceous madtsoiid origins since their currently\nknown earliest representatives are from the Coniacian\u2013Santonian of\nNiger^1,2,9,76,77. Future sampling from the pre-Maastrichtian horizons of\nAfrica and Indo-Madagascar may help resolve this conundrum.\n\nThe Indian madtsoiids, namely Vasuki indicus, Madtsoia pisdurensis, and\nPlatyspondylophis tadkeshwarensis, are resolved into two distinct sub-clades\n(Fig. 8). Platyspondylophis (Ypresian) and the Malagasy Adinophis fisaka\n(Maastrichtian) are recovered as sister-taxa, whereas Vasuki (early Lutetian)\nis the earliest-diverging member of a clade comprising Madtsoia pisdurensis\n(Maastrichtian) and the North African Gigantophis garstini (Priabonian). These\nphylogenetic relations suggest Late Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene biotic exchanges\nbetween the Indian subcontinent, Madagascar and North Africa. Among the\nvarious competing hypotheses explaining such faunal links, Krause et al.^74\nhypothesized connections (stepping stones) between the Indian subcontinent,\nMadagascar and Africa during the Late Cretaceous, which were possibly\ndestroyed in subsequent tectonic events (e.g., subduction, hotspot related\nvolcanism). The Oman-Kohistan-Ladakh arc (OKL) is another biogeographic\npathway which is considered to have facilitated biotic interchanges between\nNorth Africa and India following the subcontinent\u2019s collision with OKL at ~ 80\nMa^78. While there is some support from paleomagnetic and radiometric data for\nthe 80 Ma Indo\u2013OKL collision^78, subsequent studies based on detrital zircon\nages and dating of post-collisional olasses have provided alternate\nexplanations bearing on the sequence of accretion of the OKL with\nIndia/Asia^79,80. These studies support OKL\u2013Eurasia collision by ~ 100\u201380 Ma,\nwith India colliding with Asia + OKL only during the Paleogene. This makes the\npossibility of Late Cretaceous Indo\u2013African faunal exchange less likely^2.\nMore recent studies based on paleomagnetic data propose an initial collision\nbetween India and Kohistan-Ladakh arc at ~ 60\u201350 Ma followed by their final\ncollision with Asia at ~ 45\u201350 Ma, with the arc being positioned at 8.3 \u00b1\n5.6\u00b0N at ~ 66\u201362 Ma^81,82.\n\nAmong the scenarios discussed above we consider the following to be the most\nplausible explanation for the Indo-Madagascar-North African biotic links\nsuggested by phylogenetic disposition of the Indian madtsoiids:\n\n  1. (i)\n\nA sister taxa relationship between the Maastrichtian Malagasy Adinophis fisaka\nand Indian Platyspondylophis (Ypresian) suggests a dispersal event at or\nbefore Indo-Madagascar separation at ~ 88 Ma^83. The direction of dispersal,\nhowever, remains uncertain as the available fossil evidence does not allow a\ncritical evaluation of this hypothesis due to the poor sampling record of pre-\nMaastrichtian Malagasy and Indian deposits. However, recovery of Madtsoia from\nthe Maastrichtian of both India and Madagascar^8 (Fig. 8) supports the\nprevalence of their biotic links, as also suggested by other groups including\ncordyliform lizards and the nigerophid Indophis^75,84.\n\n  2. (ii)\n\nPost Indo-Madagascar separation at ~ 88 Ma, there was extended periods of\nisolation which ended with collision of the Indian subcontinent + Kohistan-\nLadakh arc with Asia in the early Paleogene^50,81,82 resulting in\nbiogeographic pathways with North Africa through southern Eurasia (Fig. 9).\n\n  3. (iii)\n\nVasuki, Madtsoia pisdurensis and Gigantophis garstini form a distinct clade to\nthe exclusion of others, with the earliest-diverging taxa from India (Fig. 8).\nThis clade also shows close phylogenetic links between Late Cretaceous and\nMiddle Eocene Indian taxa, suggesting a possible Indian origin for this clade.\nThe placement of Gigantophis garstini within this clade indicates possible\ndispersal events from India to North Africa following India-Asia collision,\nconsistent with the Late Eocene (Priabonian, 37\u201335 Ma^2) age of Gigantophis\nand recent paleobiogeographic reconstructions showing dispersal routes between\nIndia and North Africa via southern Eurasia following the collision^43 (Fig.\n9). Whereas an African origin of Gigantophis garstini cannot be ruled out\nconsidering the recovery of madtsoiids from the Late Cretaceous deposits of\nthat continent, the taxonomic and phylogenetic uncertainties offer little\nsupport for this hypothesis. However, Rio and Mannion\u2019s^2 alternative\nexplanation that an Early Cretaceous pan-Gondwanan dispersal and long ghost\nlineages may have led to close phylogenetic relations between Gigantophis\ngarstini and the Indian madtsoiids, though potentially valid, is currently\nweakly supported because of poor sampling.\n\nTo summarize, we identify a lineage of exceptionally large-bodied madtsoiids\n(represented by the largest known madtsoiids, Vasuki and Gigantophis garstini)\nwhich originated in the Indian subcontinent and subsequently spread to Africa\nvia southern Eurasia during the Eocene. The discovery of Vasuki, and the\nsparse anatomical coverage of known madtsoiids highlight the need for rigorous\nsampling of Late Cretaceous and Paleogene Gondwanan deposits. Recovery of\nadditional material and new taxa (including large-sized forms) may provide\nfurther insights into madtsoiid systematics and biogeography.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Osteological description\n\nThe osteological description of the skeletal specimens was carried out\nfollowing the nomenclature of LaDuke et al.^1, Rio and Mannion^2 and Mohabey\net al.^8. Different parameters of the fossil specimens were measured\n(Supplementary Fig. 2) using Mitutoyo digital callipers with a precision of\n0.01 mm. Explanatory line drawings are used wherever necessary. The\nterminology for vertebral laminae and fossae follows Rio and Mannion^2 and\nTschopp^29.\n\n### Phylogenetic analysis\n\nThe phylogenetic affinity of Vasuki was assessed in two separate analyses\n(Analysis 1 and 2). In Analysis 1 (Supplementary Dataset 1) the character-\ntaxon matrix of Zaher et al.^30 was used. All non-Pan-Serpentes toxicoferans\nwere removed except for Varanus exanthematicus which was used as the outgroup.\n15 madtsoiid taxa, including Vasuki, were added. The character-taxon matrix\nincluded 72 taxa and 785 characters. The phylogenetic analysis was performed\nusing TNT version 1.6^85 where the software memory was set to retain 10,000\ntrees and a display buffer of 10 Mb. The Traditional Search option was used to\nanalyse the dataset. The constraints for the analysis included 50 replications\nof Wagner trees, in which the swapping algorithm was bisection reconnection\nwith 10 trees saved per replication. To determine the robustness of the nodes,\nBremer support values were calculated using the script bremer.run in which\nonly trees suboptimal by 20 steps were retained.\n\nIn Analysis 2 (Supplementary Dataset 2) all non-madtsoiid Serpentes were\nremoved except for the basal ophidians Najash and Sanajeh. The latter taxon\nwas used as the outgroup. The dataset combined the cranial and vertebral\ncharacters of Zaher et al.^30 and Garberoglio et al.^3, respectively. 3\nadditional madtsoiid taxa were included. The character-taxon matrix included\n22 taxa and 656 characters. The analysis was performed using TNT version\n1.6^85 following the software settings and search parameters of Analysis 1.\nThe script bremer.run was used to calculate Bremer support values in which\nonly trees suboptimal by 20 steps were retained.\n\n### Time-calibrated tree\n\nThis was constructed by plotting the temporal ranges of the snake taxa onto\nthe majority rule tree of Analysis 2 against a numerically calibrated\ngeological time-scale. The temporal ranges of the taxa used in this study have\nbeen obtained from the Paleobiology Database (https://www.paleobiodb.org/),\nRio and Mannion^2, and Garberoglio et al.^3.\n\n### Body length estimation\n\nThe body-length estimates of Vasuki were based on the datasets of Head et\nal.^31 and McCartney et al.^32. The dataset of Head et al.^31 comprises\nmeasurements of trans-postzygapophyseal width (poW) and TBL of 21 extant boine\ntaxa, whereas that of McCartney et al.^32 include measurements of trans-\nprezygapophyseal width and total body length of 21 extant snakes.\n\nThe following predictive regression equations were formulated after\n\n  1. 1.\n\nHead et al.^31:\n\n$${\\text{y}}\\, = \\,{1}00.{\\text{72x}}\\, + \\,{436}.{24},$$\n\nwhere postzygapophyseal width (x) is equated with the total body length (y).\nThe dataset was from vertebrae 60% posteriorly along the vertebral column, and\nwas not log transformed as the measured parameters were approximately normally\ndistributed (sensu Head et al.^31).\n\n$${\\text{y}}\\, = \\,{1}0{5}.{\\text{98x}}\\, + \\,{39}0,$$\n\nwhere postzygapophyseal width (x) is equated with the total body length (y).\nThe dataset was from vertebrae 65% posteriorly along the vertebral column, and\nwas not log transformed as the measured parameters were approximately normally\ndistributed (sensu Head et al.^31).\n\n  2. 2.\n\nMcCartney et al.^32 and Garberoglio et al.^3:\n\n$${\\text{y}}\\, = \\,{1}.0{\\text{739x}}\\, + \\,{1}.{9842},$$\n\nwhere trans-prezygapophyseal width (x) is equated with the total body length\n(y). Log transformed values of the measured parameters were used to normalize\nthe dataset.\n\nIn previous studies, body lengths have been estimated for extinct snakes,\nwhich are part of extant clades, using maximum likelihood methods^31,32. Head\net al.^31 developed a model depicting intracolumnar variation of vertebral\nmorphology in extant boines to assign vertebral specimens of the giant extinct\nboid Titanoboa to their most likely position in the vertebral column. Based on\nvertebral landmarks, the specimens of Titanoboa were matched to a position\n60\u201365% posteriorly along the column (MTV, sensu Rio and Mannion^2), and size\nestimates were obtained by regressing TBL on poW based on vertebrae of extant\nboines from those positions. However, such models showing intracolumnar\nvariation in madtsoiids are currently non-existent as very few of these snakes\nare known from complete/nearly complete vertebral column^2. Size estimates of\nVasuki were calculated in this study using MTV following Rio and Mannion^2,\nalthough, these estimates should be considered tentative as the specimens of\nVasuki cannot be assigned to the same position as the boine vertebrae used to\nformulate the equations. Also, there may be differences in the relationship\nbetween poW and TBL between extant boines and Vasuki. Furthermore,\nuncertainties associated with the phylogenetic position of Madtsoiidae\nrelative to crown snakes, preclude formulation of models showing intracolumnar\nvariation in vertebral morphology based on any extant clade. Consequently,\npredictive regression equations, based on data from an array of extant snakes\nfrom McCartney et al.^32, were used to determine the body length of the new\nIndian taxon and therefore, the estimated lengths, though reasonable, should\nalso be treated with caution.\n\n### Estimation of paleotemperature\n\nPaleotemperature estimates were obtained using the following equation provided\nin Head et al.^31:\n\n$$\\mathrm{MAPT }=MAT+3\\mathrm{\\alpha }10 \\,^\\circ\n{\\text{C}}\\left(\\frac{{{\\text{log}}}_{10}\\left(TB{L}_{v}/TB{L}_{M}\\right)}{{{\\text{log}}}_{10}{{\\text{Q}}}_{10}}\\right),$$\n\n$$\\mathrm{MAPT }=MAT+5.1\\, ^\\circ\n{\\text{C}}\\left(\\frac{{{\\text{log}}}_{10}\\left(TB{L}_{v}/TB{L}_{M}\\right)}{0.41}\\right),$$\n\nwhere MAPT is the mean annual paleotemperature; MAT is the present mean annual\ntemperature (26.5 \u00b0C^52); TBL_M = 10.05 m is the maximum total body length of\nMalayopython reticulatus^41; TBL_V is the maximum estimated body length of\nVasuki (15.2 m); Q_10 (mass specific metabolic rate of pythonids) = 2.6^86; \u03b1\n(metabolic scaling component) = 0.17^52,87.\n\nSince Madtsoiidae are an extinct clade, the body length of Malayopython\nreticulatus (Serpentes, Pythonidae) was used in the study as it is the longest\nknown extant snake^42. The choice of Malayopython as the modern analog is\nbased on the similarity in gross vertebral morphology and, inferred mode of\nlife and habitat between Vasuki and extant large-bodied\npythonids^40,41,42,43,45. However, in the absence of extant representatives of\nmadtsoiids or their close relatives, the estimated paleotemperature values\nshould be treated with caution.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll data associated with the manuscript are provided in the Supplementary\nFile.\n\n## Code availability\n\nNomenclatural acts.
