On Replit, students can write code\nin any programming language without any setup, all in the browser.\n\nWhen I was a teacher from 2021 to 2023, Replit was the ideal product for\nteaching Python and Java in my classroom. Replit Teams for Education was a\ngreat way to organize assignments and gather student work. However, at the end\nof 2023, Replit turned their focus to AI-based development for professionals.\nDue to this shift in focus, Teams for Education was deprecated. Now, thousands\nof teachers need to find a Replit alternative for schools. This has been\nincredibly frustrating for teachers, and they need solutions, approximately\nyesterday.\n\nLuckily, I had been working on an education focused code editor, Pickcode, as\na weekend side project while I was a teacher. After some success on Hour of\nCode and with early customers, I began working full time on Pickcode in June\n2023.\n\nDue to my time in the classroom, I have a lot of opinions about what\nconstitutes a good replacement for Replit. I believe Pickcode does more than\nsimply recreate Replit Teams for Education. Pickcode is tailor-made for\nteachers and students.\n\nPickcode\u2019s online code editor is a great Replit replacement for middle and\nhigh schools as we offer:\n\n  * Support for Python, Java, and HTML/CSS/Javascript editing\n  * A lesson editor to set up starter code and instructions slides for students\n  * Lightweight LMS features for rostering students, managing their logins, and accessing their work for grading\n\nThis year, we will add:\n\n  * Turtle/Tkinter/Pygame graphical programs in Python\n  * Live multiplayer editing, like Google Docs, allowing you to collaborate and monitor student progress in real time\n  * Improved assignment management and a simple way to build autograded assignments\n\nWe have no plans to:\n\n  * Add AI features for students - AI does more harm than good for beginners\n  * Add a crazy complicated LMS that requires professional development to use - Pickcode should work for you within your first few minutes of logging on\n  * Add social features or advertisements - These are distractions that hurt student privacy\n  * Make major user interface changes that disrupt the student experience mid-year - Our editor is pretty nice as it is!\n\nWe will never make a product as complicated or powerful as Replit or other\nproducts for professionals like VS Code. Our early adopters appreciate our\nsimple, streamlined, easy to use tool that does exactly what they need and no\nmore.\n\nReplit is a very large company worth billions of dollars. While I\u2019d like to be\na billionaire, I love running our three person company, focused on education,\nwhere I can directly work with teachers.\n\nOn that note, Pickcode is a for profit company. I would be wary of any product\nthat is free, as how long will it be around? I would also be wary of any\nproduct that charges substantially more than $1000/year. Our servers cost\nmoney, but not that much. Depending on school size, our pricing starts at\n$500/year. If you\u2019re a teacher and need to pay for Pickcode out of pocket, we\ncan offer a steep discount. We will work with you to find pricing that works\nwithin your budget, but we cannot offer our software for free.\n\nWith a paid product like Pickcode, we can offer superior support, stability,\nand security. Using a product designed specifically for education will save\nyou and your students time and frustration. Our in browser tools work on\nChromebooks, Windows, or Mac, without any installation by your school\u2019s tech\ndepartment.\n\nFor customer support, rather than waiting for responses on a community forum,\nteachers paying for Pickcode Classroom can email me and my team directly. No\npromises, but we usually respond within minutes. When teachers report bugs, we\ntypically have them fixed within one week. If you\u2019re paying for software, you\ndeserve great customer support!\n\nRegarding stability, Pickcode is used every day by thousands of students\nacross the US. Our existing customers have experienced less than one hour of\ndowntime in the past year. When our servers crash, our team directly gets a\nphone call. I don\u2019t like those calls, but they happen quite rarely and we get\nthings back online within minutes.\n\nWe take security and privacy very seriously. We will sign data privacy\nagreements, and are fully COPPA and FERPA compliant. You can easily work with\nus to create completely anonymous accounts for your students, and if you don\u2019t\nneed us to back up student work, you can use the product completely without\nstudent accounts.\n\nAs Pickcode grows, our focus will always be on supporting teachers. I\u2019m\nexcited about the future of Pickcode, and how we can help schools move on from\nReplit in a way that doesn\u2019t just replace it, but improve on it. If you\u2019d like\nto use our editor, you can try it for free before upgrading to a classroom\nplan. If there\u2019s a feature you want before switching over, just email me at\ncharlie@pickcode.io.\n\n## Read more\n\n### The Most Important Button in a Code Editor\n\nI\u2019ve made many buttons in the course of developing Pickcode, our code editor\nfor middle and high schools.
