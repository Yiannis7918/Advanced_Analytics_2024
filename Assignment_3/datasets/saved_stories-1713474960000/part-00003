Based\non 27 remarkably preserved vertebrae found in Gujarat, this was one of the\nbiggest snakes ever to grace our planet, according to a report Thursday in\nScientific Reports \u2013 possibly as much as 15 meters (nearly 50 feet) long, and\ncounting.\n\nResearchers Debajit Datta and Sunil Bajpai of the Indian Institute of\nTechnology Roorkee believe the specimen they found was a full-grown adult.\n\nLifelike reconstruction of the vertebrae of Vasuki, dorsal (top) viewCredit:\nSunil Bajpai and Debajit Datta\n\nRecently, other researchers reported on the discovery of another unknown but\nvery much alive giant snake: the northern green anaconda, living in the\nAmazon. The longest such specimen observed and recorded to date was 8.4\nmeters.\n\nThe new species, Vasuki Indicus, may have been double that size. It was named\nfor Vasuki, the mythical \"king of snakes\" coiled around the neck of the Hindu\ndeity Shiva, and India.\n\nVasuki was reputedly devoted to Shiva, indeed having no life without the\ndeity, and is venerated to this very day.\n\n  * Science recognizes new species of giant snake: The northern green anaconda\n  * Snake newly identified in Israel, Lebanon is named for Druze people\n  * New snake family identified in Israel and Africa\n\nThe bones of the actual paleosnake were found in the Panandhro Lignite Mine in\nKutch and were dated to the Middle Eocene, a warm period 47.8 million to 38\nmillion years ago.\n\nLike the anaconda, this snake may have appeared rather rotund. Its vertebrae\nmeasure between 6.2 and 11.1 centimeters in width, suggesting a broad,\ncylindrical body, Datta and Bajpai say. They believe it did not resort to the\naquatic lifestyle to support its bodyweight but lived on land, or was semi-\naquatic. They are however pretty sure it wasn't arboreal, on the grounds of\nthe shape of its vertebrae and horse sense.\n\nLarge fat snakes like the anaconda are ambush hunters because speed is not\ntheir forte, and Vasuki likely employed a similar hunting strategy, the\nresearchers posit.\n\nWas Vasuki the biggest snake ever? Maybe. Another extinct reptile, Titanoboa,\nwas comparable in size. Titanoboa lived in South America and estimates place\nit at maybe as much as 14.3 meters long, but paleontology is the art of\ninterpreting what we find. Likely we have not found the biggest Titanoboa or\nVasuki Indicus that ever lived.\n\nThe newly identified, if tragically extinct, giant snake belonged to the\nmadtsoiidae family of snakes, which emerged 100 million years ago in the Late\nCretaceous in the paleosupercontinent of Gondwana as it was breaking up. Some\nmadtsoiidae have been found in Laurentia, but all known early-diverging groups\nin the madtsoiidae are from landmasses that had been part of Gondwana.\n\nHow do the researchers distinguish between their new species and other\nmadtsoiidaes? \"We determined that our specimens belonged to a new species by\ncomparing the anatomy of the fossils with that of other extinct and present-\nday snakes. Our conclusion was further scrutinized by running phylogenetic\nanalyses where the evolutionary position of Vasuki was tested with other\npresent-day and extinct snakes,\" they answered via email.\n\nA giant python in a jungle lake covered with fog.Credit: Artem Avetisyan /\nShutterstock.com\n\nIf once paleontologists thought the madtsoiidae were related to boas and\npythons, now they believe the family was much more basal \u2013 an earlier snake.\nThe very earliest snakes we know of, based on the fossil record, lived in the\nMesozoic Era, around 170 million years ago (or possibly even earlier \u2013 fossils\nfrom that time indicate they were already diverse).\n\nVasuki Indicus specifically seems to have been a distinct \"relic\" lineage of\ngiant madtsoiidae that originated in India, Datta and Bajpai say. From there,\nits lineage spread to Europe and then to Africa about 56 to 34 million years\nago. How did it achieve that? Around 55 million years ago, the Indian\nsubcontinent began to collide with Asia, enabling the snakes to slither onward\nand outward, expanding their range.\n\nAnother fossil madtsoiid snake discovered in India, in Pisdura, was named\nMadtsoia and was calculated to have been 5 meters long. That paper points out\nthat fossils of the madtsoiidae are actually rare in India compared with other\nland masses that had been part of Gondwana and most had been small.\n\nThe last known stamping grounds of the madtsoiidae were Australia and South\nAmerica.\n\nWhen they reigned, some madtsoiidae were small, like most snakes today, and\nsome were enormous, like Vasuki. Some speculate that serpent gigantism was\ndriven by the relatively high temperatures of the Middle Eocene, which\naveraged around 28 degrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit). However, there is\nno consensus on gigantism and climate. And now, perhaps to the relief of\nophidiophobes, they are gone.\n\n## Click the alert icon to follow topics:\n\n  * Paleontology\n  * India\n  * Environment & Nature\n  * Science & Technology\n\n##\n\nComments\n\n### In the News\n\n##### In the News\n\n  * Israel-Hamas War Live Updates\n  * October 7 - Six Months\n  * Israel - Iran\n  * Israel Flights\n  * Hostage Deal\n  * Passover\n  * Israeli Hostages\n\n#### Giant Snake, Maybe the Biggest Ever, Discovered in Prehistoric India\n\n#### Palestinian Photographer Wins World Press Photo of the Year With Poignant\nShot From Gaza\n\n#### Netanyahu's Office Chief Offers Witness in PM Trial Paid Vacation Ahead\nof Her Testimony\n\n#### For Israel, October 7 Was the Start of Forever War.
