Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\nThe Gaza war has put a renewed focus on a two-state solution to the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict as foreseen by the Oslo accords in the early 1990s.\n\nThe US, EU and UK have recently imposed sanctions on individual settlers in\nthe West Bank amid surging violence.\n\nIsraeli planning authorities have approved two new settlements since the\noutbreak of the war, the first to be approved in East Jerusalem in more than a\ndecade. The expansion of a gated high-security settlement called Kidmat Zion,\nin the heart of the Palestinian neighbourhood Ras al-Amud on the eastern\nperiphery of the city, is also set to go ahead pending comments from the\npublic.\n\nA decision on Kidmat Zion was made just 48 hours after the Hamas attack on 7\nOctober. The government was officially made part of the project in a planning\nhearing a month earlier, documents on the planning authorities\u2019 website show.\n\nTwo major projects now flank the Palestinian community of Beit Safafa, most of\nwhich is in East Jerusalem. One, known as Givat Hamatos, was frozen for a\ndecade due to international opposition. Work resumed in 2020 and last month\nthe site was busy with workers, heavy machinery and trucks.\n\nAccording to the most recent official planning documents, the \u201cinitiator\u201d and\n\u201capplicant\u201d for the project is the Israel Land Authority, a governmental body.\nThe document lists stakeholders as the state of Israel and the Jerusalem\nmunicipality among others.\n\nA second large housing development is known as Givat Shaked and will be built\non the north-western side of Beit Safafa, on a plot of grass and trees.\n\nOfficial documents viewed by the Guardian show that the entity which has\nformally filed the plan is the Jerusalem Development Authority, a statutory\nbody that aims to \u201cpromote Jerusalem as a leading international city in the\neconomic sector and in quality of life in the public domain\u201d.\n\nThe project\u2019s \u201cinitiator\u201d is the Ministry of Justice, through an office known\nas the General Custodian, which claims responsibility for the land on which\nGivat Shaked will be built because it includes substantial tracts that had\nJewish owners before 1948.\n\nThe Givat Shaked project has been a source of division since building was\nfirst proposed there in the mid-1990s. Concerns that this posed a threat to\nthe Oslo peace process led to international outrage and Washington pushed\nIsrael to cancel the plan.\n\nTwo years ago the scheme regained momentum. The interior minister at the time,\nAyelet Shaked, rejected any claims of Palestinian control over Jerusalem\u2019s\neast and said it was \u201cunthinkable to prevent development and construction in\nthis area, or anywhere else in the city\u201d.\n\nShaked also stressed the need \u201cto increase the supply of housing\u201d in\nJerusalem. Other supporters of the scheme claimed Palestinians would be able\nto move into the new \u201cneighbourhood\u201d.\n\nFull planning approval was given on 4 January this year.\n\nA temporary cement plant has been created on the land slated for development\nnear Beit Safafa to aid the expansion of the light-rail line. Photograph:\nAlessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\nThe scheme involves high-rise blocks containing 700 housing units that occupy\nthe only land in Beit Safafa where the 17,000-strong majority Muslim community\ncould expand to accommodate young people. In the neighbourhood, as elsewhere,\nbureaucratic obstacles and other restrictions usually prevent Palestinians\nfrom building larger homes.\n\n\u201cOur family has been here for 250 years ... Now I have a black hole in my\nheart because I can\u2019t see how my children and grandchildren can spend their\nlives here,\u201d said Ahmed Salman, 71, the chair of Beit Safafa\u2019s community\ncouncil.\n\n\u201cWe had good relations with the municipality once, but not in recent years.\nSince the war, life goes on but they approved the plan and dismissed all our\nobjections. We are appealing but I\u2019m not optimistic.\u201d\n\nA third project, also near Beit Safafa, is known as Lower Aqueduct and\ninvolves the construction of a large settlement adjacent to a Palestinian\nneighbourhood. The Lower Aqueduct plan was fully approved on 29 December.\n\nThe site straddles the line between East Jerusalem and the western part of the\ncity. The initiator and applicant of the project is the Israel Land Authority,\ndocuments show.\n\nThe construction of Givat Hamatos had been postponed for a decade due to\ninternational opposition. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\n\u201cMany of the settlement plans are strategically designated for areas along the\nsouthern perimeter of East Jerusalem,\u201d said Amy Cohen, of Ir Amim, an Israeli\nhuman rights NGO based in Jerusalem. \u201cIf constructed, they would further\nfracture the Palestinian space ... and create a \u2018sealing-off\u2019 effect of East\nJerusalem from Bethlehem and the southern West Bank. Such moves directly\nundermine conditions necessary for a viable independent Palestinian state with\na contiguous capital in East Jerusalem.\n\n\u201cAll this while bringing planning and building for Palestinians in the city to\na complete stop.\u201d\n\nThe minutes of a planning meeting held in September show that the office of\nthe General Custodian was accepted as a co-applicant on the Kidmat Zion plan,\nthough it was initiated by a private company established by an organisation\ncalled Ateret Cohanim, a group that works to increase the Jewish population of\nEast Jerusalem.\n\nAteret Cohanim has been accused of being behind attempts to evict Palestinians\nin East Jerusalem and to take over Christian hotels in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City.\nIt says the new settlement, which will be heavily fortified, is to be built on\nJewish-owned land.\n\nA recent United Nations report noted that the policies of Israel\u2019s government,\nwhich is the most right wing in the country\u2019s history and includes religious\nnationalists with close ties to settlers, appeared aligned with the goals of\nthe Israeli settler movement to an \u201cunprecedented extent\u201d.\n\nIsraeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories had expanded by a\nrecord amount and risked eliminating any practical possibility of a\nPalestinian state, the UN report said.\n\nAbout 40% of Jerusalem\u2019s population of roughly 1 million are Palestinian.\nMaintaining a Jewish majority in the city has been an aim of successive\nIsraeli governments.\n\nIsrael captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the six-day war of 1967 and\nlater annexed it in a move not recognised by most of the international\ncommunity.Permanent settlement of territory occupied militarily is illegal\nunder international law.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Israel\n  * Palestinian territories\n  * Middle East and north Africa\n  * Israel-Gaza war\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
