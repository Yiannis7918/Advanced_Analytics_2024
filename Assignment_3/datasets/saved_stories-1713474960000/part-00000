One is that you should follow your passions, and the other is that\nyour passion has something to do with saving the world or making the world a\nbetter place.\n\nYou work to make money, not make the world a better place. Making the world \u201ca\nbetter place\u201d may be a side effect of your business (it\u2019s arguably a side\neffect of most businesses outside of private equity and internet advertising),\nit might be a brand for your business, but if it\u2019s what defines your business,\nyour business will probably fail because you\u2019re not thinking about business,\nyou\u2019re thinking about something else. For example, the Davos-spawn company\n\u201cBetter Place.\u201d It was obvious on inspection this would fail, and even if it\nsucceeded via regulatory capture it would make the world more dystopian.\nElectric cars continue to be a stupid idea for general use. There simply ain\u2019t\nenough electricity in the fragile power grid, and most of it comes from fossil\nfuels, so converting automobile use to electrical is out of the question.\nPutting that aside, using exchangeable battery packs owned by some giant firm\nis both shady, a liability nightmare and insane. They burned a billion dollars\nand shipped batteries for 1400 cars which ended up being useless without a\ncompany to support them.\n\nThere was no business case for \u201cBetter Place.\u201d There was no physical or\neconomic need for this complex and ridiculous scheme. This wouldn\u2019t have\nhelped the environment at all: it is impossible for this hare-brained scheme\nto do so for simple thermodynamics reasons. But it was something that caught\nthe imagination of people who wanted to make the world a better place. You\ncould have made the world a better place working at SpaceX or even Google. If\nyou like electric cars, Tesla made numerous real breakthroughs, and was\nrelentless about making money (IMO their cars suck). You could also have made\nthe world a better place by piling up giant heaps of money and donating it to\nworthy causes. Or if you\u2019re incapable of this, you could volunteer at the soup\nkitchen, or help bums kick their drug habits: that is actually helping, rather\nthan nerd fantasies about saving the planet like Mr. Spock. Nebulous pieties\nand bullshit do not make the world a better place. Get your nebulous pieties\nfrom religion like a normal human being; your personal vision of \u201cmaking the\nworld a better place\u201d is almost certainly false because you\u2019re a dumb monkey\nmore susceptible to mass media programming with obvious falsehoods than in any\nother era of human history.\n\nMuh passion\n\nYou can have fun at work, you should be interested in your work and lowering\nthe entropy of the universe, and you can do work that gives you energy and\nsatisfaction if you\u2019re lucky, you can even be obsessed with work, but you\nshould not be passionate about your work. Save that for the bedroom. That\u2019s a\nnostrum, as Scott Adams put it, that successful people use: \u201cfollow your\npassions.\u201d It\u2019s a distraction from how they became successful, which is\nruthless competition, fierce struggle, hard work and luck. Also because\nsuccessful people are generally luckier, smarter, better looking, were harder\nworking than their competitors and may have been born with other advantages.\nNobody wants to hear that. They want to hear some happy bullshit about\nfollowing your passions. I might believe that Oligarch Bezos was passionate\nabout selling crap on the internet at some point: it\u2019s easy to be passionate\nwhen you\u2019re winning. Lots of people followed their passions into the poor\nhouse. His biggest success was EC2 API shit, which I 100% guarantee was nerd\nrage (or admiration) at how service APIs worked at DE Shaw, rather than any\npassionate desire to build really modular service APIs.\n\nImagine investing with someone who is actually following their passions! Adams\nuses the example of the sports memorabilia nerd opening a sports memorabilia\nshop being a terrible investment. Let\u2019s make it more obvious: would you invest\nin a coke dealer who is passionate about high quality cocaine? Would you\ninvest in a brothel run by a sex addict? You want to invest in someone that\nwants to make money, has a clear path to doing so, and has the drive and\ntalent to pull it off. Dental practices are good investments; nobody is\npassionate about dentistry, but everyone loves money and healthy teeth. People\nwith 7 kids to feed are good investments. People working on their passions as\navocation are numskulls.\n\nJust following my passions\n\nI get this silly happy talk from Silicon Valley dunderheads and their victims\nall the time. People ask me about my passions as if that\u2019s what motivates me.\nI\u2019ve helped a few things that people were doing as passion projects (which\nmade the world a better place even). Nobody made money on these projects, and\nwhatever good my efforts did for them would have been better spent making\nmoney and donating it to charity, or simply giving it to a street bum who will\nuse it on drugs. This sort of thing doesn\u2019t go anywhere: actually selling\nthings would have been better for the state of the human race.\n\nThese sorts of things are American Upper-Middle class nostrums. Like all\nAmerican Upper-Middle class nostrums, they\u2019ve confounded concepts of personal\nsuccess, making money and status anxiety. The UMC is ridiculously status\nsensitive in a way other social classes are not, because they realize their\nposition is precarious, and are terrified of being normal schlubs; this is one\nof the things which makes them so ridiculous. They tell themselves nonsense\nlike this to grub up the status pole with their wives boyfriends. It\u2019s rubbish\nand everyone should laugh this sort of nonsense to scorn.\n\nIf you want to get all weeb about it, the Japanese have a concept called\nIkigai. As far as I can tell it\u2019s their version of what Aristotle talks about\nin his various Moralia, which nobody reads any more, but everyone should. I\nthink this concept is what silly con valley dorks are reaching for when they\nsay they follow their passion or save the world or whatever, but because\nthey\u2019re using different words, and people don\u2019t parse them right. Stupid upper\nmiddle class American class-neurotic nostrums: these are just confusion.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n  * Reddit\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nMormon nuclear fusionJuly 2, 2013In \"Design\"\n\nKickstarter: muppet graveyard part 2March 1, 2013In \"fraud\"\n\nQuant ideas to save the financial systemNovember 26, 2010In \"finance\njournalism\"\n\n26 comments\n\n\u00ab Against the nerds\n\n### 26 Responses\n\nSubscribe to comments with RSS.\n\n  1.

I liked his business book, where I got this from. Also,\nDilbert.\n\nReply\n\n  3. nathanmagneticresonance said, on April 16, 2024 at 1:27 pm\n\nThe late Dr. Kaczynski would probably have a lot to say about how \u201cbetter\nplace\u201d talk constitutes what he called \u201csurrogate activities\u201d that we pursue\nwhen we don\u2019t have anything else pressing to do like finding a meal.\n\nTo be fair, most people haven\u2019t ascended far enough along Maslow\u2019s hierarchy\nto consider these things, so in a sense the people talking about this stuff\nactually aren\u2019t working for money. Most of them probably have enough that they\ncould cut their expenses and survive the rest of their life on their savings\nif they wanted to, or they have rich parents or spouses to fall back on if\nthey ever needed to, so survival doesn\u2019t seem like a particularly pressing\nneed.\n\nOnce survival is taken care of, people start looking for ways to achieve\npurpose and autonomy. Autonomy is pretty clear-cut, but purpose usually\ninvolves some rationalization and that\u2019s how you end up with \u201cbetter world\u201d\ntalk.\n\nBtw most dentists I\u2019ve personally known are happy people who I would consider\nto be passionate about their profession\u2013granted they aren\u2019t working on\npeople\u2019s teeth in their spare time (although some do volunteer), but their job\nhas purpose and autonomy and affords them a good living. Jeff Bezos may not\nhave been passionate about APIs, but he was passionate about something (e.g.,\nearning money, putting his weewee in a girl with big boobs, etc) that drove\nhim to scholastic achievement and decades of working long hours well beyond\nwhat normal people would have tolerated, and for him selling stuff on the\ninternet was the mechanism for achieving the goals he was passionate about.\n\nMost people are like this\u2013we start out with goals like \u201cmaking a lot of money\u201d\nbut in the process we get caught up in details like caring about programming\nlanguages and the minutia of what language has what feature and we end up\narguing passionately about static typing as a surrogate for whatever we\nactually care about.\n\nReply\n\n  4.

(But careful about admitting too much of this in personality\ntests for nerd companies.)\n\nIt\u2019s also refreshing to see inspirational quotes from a lady I once\ninterviewed with (hint: not the one using drugs, at least in the photo.)\n\nIn my experience working with orthodontists (\u201cupper class\u201d dentists), I found\nthem to be more passionate about their real estate and vacations than about\ndentistry \u2013 at least when not in front of their patients.\n\nReply\n\n     * Scott Locklin said, on April 16, 2024 at 10:20 pm\n\nI forgot you were talking to them.\n\nReply\n\n     * Altitude Zero said, on April 17, 2024 at 7:41 pm\n\n\u201chint: not the one using drugs, at least in the photo\u201d\n\nActually, the cocaine chick looks a good deal less psychotic than Holmes does\n\u2013 at least she\u2019s a recognizable human being engaged in understandable, if\nregrettable, behavior. Holmes always struck me as some kind of alien poorly\ndisguised as a human female: FWIW, there was always something a bit \u201coff\u201d\nabout Musk (whom I generally like) and Jobs as well..\n\nReply\n\n       * Scott Locklin said, on April 17, 2024 at 7:55 pm\n\nReply\n\n         * Chris O said, on April 17, 2024 at 8:14 pm\n\nNot at all to be woke about this, but I do think female corporate fraudsters\ntend to get a qualitatively different wrap than do male fraudsters. In this\ncase, my sense after the interview was that \u201csomething wasn\u2019t right\u201d and\nneither side contacted each other afterwards.\n\nThe other point is that these folks who fly too close to the sun are part of\nthe ecosystem. I seek to understand their impact, while of course favoring\nreigning in and punishing fraud.\n\nI\u2019m \u201cpassionate\u201d about that (no, just kidding.)\n\nReply\n\n           * Scott Locklin said, on April 17, 2024 at 8:26 pm\n\nCovered it: https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2022/08/16/the-dropout/\n\nI think the blonde numskull genius violating physical law act is done for now,\nbut perhaps I overestimate the VC.

Rickey said, on April 17, 2024 at 1:39 am\n\nMost of the successful persons I personally know are not passionate about\ntheir jobs or career. They are merely serious persons of average intelligence\nwho practice, prepare and are conscientious about the quality of their work.\nIt still surprises me how persons arrive for anything from a business meeting\nto choir practice completely unprepared and disorganized and just wing it and\nexpect good results. They are nothing but parasites to the successful.\n\nAs far as making the world a better place, subsidiarity is the best method for\nmost. Simply grabbing a shopping cart in the middle of the lot on your way\ninto a store, picking up a piece of trash instead of stepping over it, helping\nyour elderly neighbor with his hard work, etc. are just a few examples. Just\nbeing courteous to strangers would also help immensely.\n\nSending mad stacks of aid to the Haitians or \u201cPalestinians\u201d funded by\ntaxpayers may make some people feel better but that is like giving an IV to a\npatient that refuses to put pressure on his bleeding jugular vein.

Alex Chandy said, on April 17, 2024 at 3:12 am\n\nRecently read how the hierarchy of workers can be simplified into 3 layers\n\n1\\. the builders/producers 2. the optimizers 3. the regulators\n\nGenerally, finance/consulting/banking industry can be defined as a Layer 2 of\na society , to make innovations made at Layer 1 by problem solvers more\nefficient.\n\nFinance and markets are great, to gain immediate efficiencies in innovations,\nbut that fades away quickly, then we hit the diminishing returns.\n\nAs being witnessed in companies like Boeing who has traded a lot of layer 1\nfor layer 2, it is a societal problem where 60% of workforce shifted from\n\u201cproblem solvers \u2013 Layer 1\u201d to \u201cefficiency creators \u2013 Layer 2\u201d essentially\nalso growing the Layer 3 (regulators, law) from a healthy 10% to 20%\n\nWe basically have upside down societies in West where, 20% solve problems in\nLayer 1, 60% create efficiencies in Layer 2, and 20% try to regulate the Layer\n2 since it is so unnecessarily huge and full of scams.\n\nImo, this upside down triangle evolved because of short termist incentives\ndesigns combined with follow your passion and exit at a large profit, in all\nlayers of the workforce (ie \u2013 Engineer wants to build a quick consumer app and\nexit quickly rather than work on a hard problem, Wall St. wants to take that\nconsumer app public and mainly dump unprofitable business model on public,\nregulator wants to be re-elected in the next 2 years)\n\nReply\n\n  12. redneckcryonicist said, on April 17, 2024 at 7:10 am\n\nFor some reason the pro-free market people don\u2019t want to talk about the\nproblems caused by successful capitalists who use their wealth, business\nskills and other assets to promote the socially damaging projects they are\n\u201cpassionate\u201d about. Friedrich Engels is the classic example of the capitalist\nwith a damaging passion: After Engels made bank from working for the\nManchester branch of his family\u2019s textile company, he spent his retirement\nyears applying his fortune and human capital towards marketing Marxism like it\nwas a company\u2019s product, with his friend Karl Marx as the company\u2019s brand.\nEngels even wrote and published the first \u201cDummies\u201d-style literature about\nMarxism to make it more accessible to less educated people.\n\nEngels was the organized and competent half of the Marx/Engels partnership;\nand without his efforts to get other socialists to accept Marxism as their\nideology (it had competitors in the late 19th Century), Marx\u2019s legacy wouldn\u2019t\nhave amounted to much.\n\nReply\n\n  13. Foo said, on April 18, 2024 at 12:54 pm\n\nThis is absolutely right. I have been quite discriminating against people who\nclaim they\u2019re passionate about what I\u2019m hiring them for, and doubly so when\nthey appear to be genuine in saying that.\n\nThere\u2019s a major issue, which is that people who are passionate about work are\noften given to other delusions, like that their work matters to the world in a\ndeep way. Or that they, personally, are very important in some way, and have a\nmission. I already dodged a very bad bullet recently with this approach.\n\nNarcissists make for unreliable, difficult employees, and are the source of\nsome of the negative nerd stereotypes. The \u201csuperstar diva\u201d nerd, the \u201ccan\u2019t\ntake criticism nerd\u201d, the \u201cprofit is irrelevant\u201d nerd. All very passionate\nabout nerdery, all very passionate about themselves and/or their place in the\nworld. Screw that. Just do a good job, because it\u2019s a fair thing to do (since\nwe have a contract to that effect and I am paying you perfectly genuine\nbucks), and put your passion into birding, gym or something else.\n\nReply\n\n     * chiral3 said, on April 18, 2024 at 1:54 pm\n\nI get a kick out of the nerd cross-over types. In general, three types of\ncorporate nerds: the spergos that need extra management / guide rails and\nconstant sperg-centric therapy sessions when they freak out over someone using\na design pattern or estimation method that renders them apoplectic. These\nnerds have real skills, limited upward mobility, and hash out a normal career\nthat is marked by constant stress and difficult bonus-time conversations\n(\u201cyes, your code did speed things up 10x... we didn\u2019t ask for that, but I love\nthe initiative and creativity... even if you spent three months\nrefactoring.... I am sorry, you got a 4, which is great, you should be proud,\nand you\u2019re getting 148% of target, plus I popped your total comp by 25%, but I\ncan\u2019t pay you X million dollars exrtra because you think the speed up was\nworth that...\u201d) Second type are the kids that are essentially buffs and they\nhit a wall with their abilities. These types hop jobs in the ecosystem till\nthey are outed, then they move to adjacent industry and wring that chamois\nusing basically the same skills (eg hedge funds to trad fi to fintec to ed\ntech, typically a trend towards saving the world with code... oddly first gen\nfintech types tend to stay and not xover). Third type is the chameleon-nerd:\nthe person that cosplayed a nerd and they are dark-triad enough that they\nmorph into whatever the hypegeist is at that zeit. These creatures have no\ndiscernible skills and can climb a ladder because they don\u2019t make management\nfeel like idiots when they speak. They are probably talking to boards about AI\nbecoming sentient and burning their companies to the ground as I write this. A\nfew years ago they were yammering about big data; before that robotics and\nnano-automation. They typically have (only) an undergrad degree from a decent\nschool (MIT comes to mind as a factory of these people). They like to give\ntalks about nothing concrete and really hit the Theranos-esque passion of the\ntech pablum. Lotsa \u201cthere\u2019s known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown\nunknowns\u201d coupled with endless and nebulous talk about leadership (quoting\nNavy SEAL influencers, Colin Powell, and Sun Szu). If they are sixty years old\nthey are still hawking their undergrad alma mater as a credential to boards\nsince every board needs one spergo to check the box on having someone ask\nquestions like \u201cis there a p-value for that?\u201d.\n\nReply\n\n       * Foo said, on April 18, 2024 at 2:38 pm\n\nWell, you can add \u201cactivist nerd\u201d to this list now. They pop up every now and\nthen, but have been getting really insufferable. They have real skills, but\ninstead of trying to convert them to cash like your spergo-nerd (sperd?),\nbeing able to write half-decent Rust ought to give them dictatorial powers\nover broad company policy. Some might even stage a sit-in.\n\nAs to the rest of your list \u2013 pretty spot on. I deliberately stayed within my\narea of competence, but outside my area of interest, with my professional\nlife. I think that\u2019s how you can avoid falling into both traps (that of\nbecoming an incompetent x-over grifter, and that of becoming a superstar diva\n/ activist / etc).\n\nReply\n\n         * chiral3 said, on April 18, 2024 at 2:59 pm\n\nI have literally been in this meeting.
