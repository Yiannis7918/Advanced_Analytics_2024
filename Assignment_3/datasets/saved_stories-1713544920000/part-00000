Measuring 16.5 feet (5 meters) in diameter, Orion's\nheat shield is the largest of its kind developed for missions carrying\nastronauts. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nEarlier this year, NASA announced it had delayed until September 2025 the\ncrewed Artemis 2 swingby of the moon, a practice run to prepare for 2026's\nArtemis 3 mission, which will land astronauts near the lunar south pole.\n\nOne reason cited for the 10-month delay was getting to the bottom of reentry\nheat shield data from Artemis 1, which sent an uncrewed Orion capsule to lunar\norbit and back.\n\nEngineers have been analyzing data from that shakeout cruise, which began with\na launch by NASA's Space Launch System megarocket on Nov. 16, 2022.\n\nThe 25-day Artemis 1 mission ended on Dec. 11, 2022, with the Orion capsule\nsplashing down under parachutes in the Pacific Ocean off Baja California.\n\nRelated: The 10 greatest images from NASA's Artemis 1 moon mission\n\nOn Dec. 11, 2022, the Orion spacecraft for the Artemis 1 mission splashed down\nin the Pacific Ocean after a 25-day mission to lunar orbit.

But soon thereafter, NASA and contractors\nbegan wrestling with the discovery that Orion's ablative heat shield wore away\ndifferently than predicted.\n\nSome areas of expected charred material ablated away in a manner not forecast\nby computer modeling and ground testing. Also, there was slightly more\nliberation of the charred material during reentry than anticipated.\n\n## Get the Space.com Newsletter\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events\nand more!\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nOrion's heat shield features the same ablative material, called Avcoat, used\nduring the Apollo program in the late 1960s and early 1970s. However, the\nbuilding process for the heat shield was changed from the Apollo-era method.\n\nOrion's heat shield features an ablative material called Avcoat. (Image\ncredit: Lockheed Martin)\n\n## Vintage Apollo\n\nWhile Avcoat is vintage Apollo, the production process for Orion's 21st-\ncentury thermal protection system was altered.\n\nAccording to Lockheed Martin, the firm leading Orion's heat shield development\nprocess, \"instead of having workers fill 300,000 honeycomb cells one by one\nwith ablative material, then heat-cure the material and machine it to the\nproper shape, the team now manufactures Avcoat blocks \u2014 just fewer than 200 \u2014\nthat are pre-machined to fit into their positions and bonded in place on the\nheat shield's carbon fiber skin,\" the aerospace firm's website explains.\n\nThis process allows Avcoat to be applied in just a quarter of the previous\ntime and saves money as well, according to the company.\n\n## Root cause\n\nPost-flight inspection of the Artemis 1 Orion heat shield showed an\nunanticipated loss of char layer pieces from the spacecraft. NASA has been\nlaser-focused, quite literally, on understanding the root cause of the char\nloss phenomena, as well as Avcoat cracking.\n\n\"We designed and executed a building block ground testing approach using\nagency and external test facilities,\" NASA's Orion program office told\nSpace.com.\n\nThe initial test series began in the summer of 2023 and wrapped up in a last\ntest series in December 2023. \"We expect to establish root cause this spring,\"\nthe NASA office stated.\n\nThe Arc Jet Complex at NASA's Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley has been\nused to study unexpected heat shield issues found after the Orion capsule's\nArtemis 1 flight in late 2022. (Image credit: NASA Ames Research Center)\n\n## Simulation testing\n\nThose Orion heat shield tests involved the Laser Hardened Materials Evaluation\nLaboratory, a unique facility operated by UES, a BlueHalo company in Dayton,\nOhio, and managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory. This lab does thermal\nsimulation testing, equipped with high-power lasers.\n\nTesting was also performed at the Arc Jet Complex at NASA's Ames Research\nCenter in California's Silicon Valley. Arc jet testing is done on thermal\nprotection material with plasma mimicking the intense heat generated during\nthe plunging atmospheric reentry of the Orion capsule.\n\nFor its part, Lockheed Martin teamed up with NASA to organize a core team of\nengineers to investigate and understand the cause of the char loss and what\nwould need to be done to prevent similar occurrences on future flights, said\nBlaine Brown, Orion Spacecraft Mechanical Systems Director at the company.\n\n\"Over the past year, the Lockheed Martin team, alongside with NASA, have been\nvery busy producing test articles and supporting reentry environmental tests\nin various NASA and industry test chambers,\" Brown told Space.com.\n\nThese tests have produced a wealth of information for the investigation team,\nBrown said. \"Lockheed Martin has also been providing analytical expertise to\ndemonstrate acceptable thermal margins to support flight rationale for the\nArtemis 2 mission.\"\n\nRelated: NASA's Artemis program: Everything you need to know\n\n## Heat shield hiccups\n\nLast year, the Orion program office at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston\nresponded to a Space.com request for comment about heat shield hiccups.\n\n\"We expect the material to ablate with the 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit [2,760\ndegrees Celsius] the spacecraft encounters on a reentry through Earth's\natmosphere, and to see charring of the material through a chemical reaction,\nbut we didn't expect the small pieces that came off, versus being ablated,\"\nthe NASA office stated.\n\nThere was a healthy margin remaining of virgin Avcoat, and temperature data\ninside the cabin remained at expected levels, so if crew were on board they\nwould not have been in danger, the program office statement explained.\n\nNASA said a dedicated investigation includes planned testing, detailed\nanalysis, extensive sampling of the heat shield, and review of data from\nsensors to appraise what the Orion capsule experienced on reentry.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n\u2014 Artemis 1 moon rocket looks ready for astronaut missions, NASA says\n\n\u2014 NASA's Artemis moon program receives salute from Apollo 11's Buzz Aldrin\n(video)\n\n\u2014 Watch NASA test fire new and improved Artemis moon rocket engine (video)\n\n## Avcoat changes?\n\nIs it possible that changes in the Avcoat may be needed?\n\n\"It's still too early in our testing and analysis to arrive at any potential\nrecommendations or solutions that address additional char liberation,\" the\nNASA office responded in its 2023 communiqu\u00e9.\n\nIt is possible that the Artemis 1 heat shield phenomenon may just be intrinsic\nto this heat shield, the office said at the time.\n\nFurthermore, it might be what NASA would expect in the capsule's return from\nthe moon, \"but we'll let the data inform us,\" the Orion project office said,\nadding that \"our teams want the confidence that we have the best heat shield\npossible to fly humans going forward.\"\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!

Adding fuel makes everything bigger\nand bigger and vastly more expensive. The faster we can learn to come in, the\nmore we can do with what we have.\n\nReply\n\n  * orsobubu\n\n> billslugg said:\n>\n> I don't know anything about the specifics of this case but I can make a\n> guess.

The faster we can\n> learn to come in, the more we can do with what we have.\n\nyes, this is an answer from an a.i.: \"The reason spacecraft like Apollo or\nOrion enter Earth's atmosphere at such high speeds is due to the laws of\norbital mechanics. When a spacecraft is orbiting the Earth, it is essentially\nin a constant state of freefall, balanced between its velocity and the pull of\nEarth's gravity. To return to Earth, the spacecraft must slow down enough to\ndrop out of orbit and begin descending towards the surface. However, slowing\ndown in space is not easy. In the vacuum of space, there is no air resistance\nto naturally slow the spacecraft. The only way to decelerate is to use\nthrusters or engines, which requires carrying a lot of heavy fuel. It's much\nmore fuel-efficient to let Earth's atmosphere do most of the work of slowing\nthe spacecraft down. As the spacecraft enters the denser layers of the\natmosphere at high speed (around 17,000 mph for Apollo), the air resistance\ncreates intense friction and heat, up to 5000\u00b0F or more. This is why the\nspacecraft needs a heat shield to protect it and its occupants during re-\nentry. Theoretically, a spacecraft could use its engines to slow down before\nre-entry to reduce the heat. But this would require carrying much more fuel,\ngreatly increasing the spacecraft's size and weight, and making the entire\nmission more expensive and complex. Using Earth's atmosphere to decelerate is\na more practical approach. So in summary, the high re-entry speeds are a\nconsequence of the spacecraft's orbital velocity, and using the atmosphere to\nslow down, while very hot, is more efficient than carrying extra fuel to\ndecelerate before re-entry. The heat shields and re-entry profiles are\ndesigned to manage these extreme but unavoidable conditions of returning from\norbit to Earth's surface.\"\n\nReply\n\n  * billslugg\n\nThank you, yes, it makes sense. The hotter you are able to come in, the less\nfuel you need to deal with.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nJupiter's violent moon Io has been the solar system's most volcanic body for\naround 4.5 billion years\n\nAlt-space history series 'For All Mankind' gets 5th season, new 'Star City'\nspinoff\n\nNASA greenlights 2028 launch for epic Dragonfly mission to Saturn's huge moon\nTitan\n\nSolar eclipse 2024: Live updates\n\nNASA still investigating Orion heat shield issues from Artemis 1 moon mission\n\nSweden becomes 38th country to sign NASA's Artemis Accords for moon\nexploration\n\nIngenuity team says goodbye to pioneering Mars helicopter\n\nBoom's XB-1 test plane gets FAA green light for supersonic flight\n\nSaturn's 'Death Star' moon Mimas may have gotten huge buried ocean from ringed\nplanet's powerful pull\n\nMysterious dark matter may leave clues in 'strings of pearls' trailing our\ngalaxy\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope's 'shocking' discovery may hint at hidden exomoon\naround 'failed star'\n\nMORE FROM SPACE...\n\n  1. 1\n\nRocket Lab gearing up to refly Electron booster for 1st time\n\n  2. 2\n\n'Transformers One' 1st trailer unveils Optimus Prime and Megatron's shared\nhistory (video)\n\n  3. 3\n\nChina rolls out rocket for next astronaut mission to Tiangong space station\n(photos)\n\n  4. 4\n\nSpaceX launches Starlink satellites on company's 40th mission of 2024 (video)\n\n  5. 5\n\nSorry, little green men: Alien life might actually be purple\n\nSpace is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading\ndigital publisher.
