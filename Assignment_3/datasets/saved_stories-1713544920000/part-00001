Two big players make the rules and it\u2019s easy to fall into their traps.\nAfter my first encounter with Google written on \u201cExposing myself live and DMCA\ntakedowns\u201d, there was another assault.\n\n###\n\nGoogle second assault\n\nPicture this: it\u2019s 2019, and I\u2019m building Tintodo, an events App with scrapped\nevents from Facebook and Eventbrite. But just as I launch the app into the\nwild, fate intervenes in the form of COVID-19. I innocuously reference the\npandemic in Tintodo\u2019s description, just to give a warning about the situation.\nCOVID-19 Apps with misinformation appear in the App Store and Google decides\nto remove all Apps referencing COVID-19. Et voil\u00e0! Another App removed from\nGoogle Play Store.\n\nI decided to post what happened to Hacker News, to see if shouting about\nGoogle's bad decisions led to suspension removal.\n\nWhile I can\u2019t say for certain if it was my outcry that spurred action, a few\ndays later, Tintodo was republished. Thankfully I didn\u2019t lose this assault.\n\n###\n\nGoogle knockout\n\nFast forward to the present day, and Bonetflix finds itself thrust into the\neye of the storm. I lost access to my Google Play Console. This means\nBonetflix Android App is no longer available on Google Play Store.\n\nGoogle Play Developer Console account closed\n\nGoogle's stringent policies have become increasingly unforgiving, particularly\nfor developers who fail to engage with their accounts regularly. Despite\nreceiving email warnings (to an unused email), the absence of any recent\nactivity left me vulnerable to account deletion. I don\u2019t even remember the\nlast time I accessed my developer account.\n\n###\n\nPlay Store's new deletion policy\n\nClosure of Inactive Developer Accounts Policy on April 2024\n\nThis policy was introduced on 5th April 2023 in Giving Users More Transparency\nand Control Over Account Data where they claim that developers will need to\nprovide an option to initiate account and data deletion from within the app\nand online.\n\nIt\u2019s funny that my account is marked as inactive, and I can\u2019t access it nor\ndelete my information. I don\u2019t have a background in legal, but I have read\nGDPR rights, and we, EU citizens have the right to access and erase our data.\nI will try to complain to DPOs before complaining to the European Data\nProtection Supervisor and see if I can get any further.\n\n###\n\nSEO Impact\n\nBonetflix Android App barely had users, but it had backlinks to Bonetflix's\nwebsite. Even though the linking text was not relevant, the rankings suffered\na lot. The average Google Ranking position increased by approximately three\npositions.\n\nGoogle Play Developer Account removal impact\n\nWhen I first published Bonetflix App, there were no significant changes in SEO\nstatistics but this fact means they have a relevant impact on its rankings. If\nI ever publish an App again, I will publish it on several App stores to\nmaximize backlinks and minimize Google dependency.\n\n###\n\nFuture steps\n\nThis incident allowed me to forget about an App that was getting a spot in my\nmind and didn\u2019t generate much revenue.\n\nAlthough I hadn\u2019t updated the App in more than a year, I was updating\nBonetflix database. I will try other small bets with this database and see how\nthings work.\n\nDavid's Indie Hacker Journey is a reader-supported publication.
