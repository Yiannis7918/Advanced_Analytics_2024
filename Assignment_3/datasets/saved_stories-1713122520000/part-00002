But the research so far has put forth mixed conclusions.\n\nStudies have found that being around cats during childhood might make a person\nmore likely to develop schizophrenia; however, not all studies have found an\nassociation.\n\nSome also link cat exposure to higher scores on scales that measure traits\nrelated to schizophrenia \u2013 which affects a person's thoughts, feelings, and\nbehaviors \u2013 and psychotic-like experiences, but again, other studies don't\nshow this connection.\n\nTo get a clearer picture, McGrath and his team say there's a need for a\nthorough review and analysis of all the research on these topics.\n\nT. gondii is a mostly harmless parasite that can be transmitted through\nundercooked meat or contaminated water.\n\nA bite from an infected cat or the feces of an infected cat can also transmit\nT. gondii. It's estimated that around 40 million people in the US may be\ninfected, usually without any symptoms. Meanwhile, researchers keep finding\nmore strange effects that infections may have.\n\nOnce inside our bodies, T. gondii can infiltrate the central nervous system\nand influence neurotransmitters. The parasite has been linked to personality\nchanges, the emergence of psychotic symptoms, and some neurological disorders,\nincluding schizophrenia.\n\nHowever, a link doesn't prove T. gondii causes these changes or that the\nparasite was passed on to a human from a cat.\n\nThe new analysis of 17 studies found \"a significant positive association\nbetween broadly defined cat ownership and an increased risk of schizophrenia-\nrelated disorders\".\n\n\"After adjusting for covariates, we found that individuals exposed to cats had\napproximately twice the odds of developing schizophrenia,\" the team explained.\n\nThere are some important things to keep in mind here, like the fact that 15 of\nthe 17 studies were case-control studies. This kind of research cannot prove\ncause and effect, and it often does not look at things that might have\naffected both the exposure and the outcome.\n\nA number of the studies that were looked at were of low quality, which is\nsomething that the authors also highlight.\n\nFindings were inconsistent across studies, but those of higher quality\nsuggested that associations in unadjusted models might have been due to\nfactors that could have influenced the results.\n\nOne study found no significant association between owning a cat before age 13\nand later developing schizophrenia, but it did find a significant link when\nnarrowing down cat ownership to a specific period (ages 9 to 12). This\ninconsistency suggests that the crucial time frame for cat exposure is not\nclearly defined.\n\nA study in the US, which involved 354 psychology students, didn't find a\nconnection between owning a cat and schizotypy scores. However, those who had\nreceived a cat bite had higher scores when compared to those who had not.\n\nAnother study, which included people with and without mental disorders,\ndiscovered a connection between cat bites and higher scores on tests measuring\nparticular psychological experiences. But they suggested other pathogens such\nas Pasteurella multocida may be responsible instead.\n\nThe researchers agree that better and broader research is needed before we can\nmake any firm interpretations.\n\n\"In conclusion, our review provides support for an association between cat\nownership and schizophrenia-related disorders,\" the authors wrote.\n\n\"There is a need for more high-quality studies, based on large, representative\nsamples to better understand cat ownership as a candidate risk-modifying\nfactor for mental disorders.\"\n\nThe study was published in Schizophrenia Bulletin.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in December 2023.\n\nTrending News\n\nFasting-Style Diet Seems to Result in Dynamic Changes to Human Brain Health4\ndays ago\n\nThe Polar Vortex Has Shifted Into Reverse \u2013 And Is Now Spinning Backwards\nEnvironment7 days ago\n\nBrain Acidity Linked With Multiple Neurological Disorders Health2 days ago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
