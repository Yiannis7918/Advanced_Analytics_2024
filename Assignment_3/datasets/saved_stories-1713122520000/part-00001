To receive it in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here.\n\nUsually when we talk about climate change, the focus is squarely on the role\nthat greenhouse-gas emissions play in driving up global temperatures, and\nrightly so. But another important, less-known phenomenon is also heating up\nthe planet: reductions in other types of pollution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn particular, the world\u2019s power plants, factories, and ships are pumping much\nless sulfur dioxide into the air, thanks to an increasingly strict set of\nglobal pollution regulations. Sulfur dioxide creates aerosol particles in the\natmosphere that can directly reflect sunlight back into space or act as the\n\u201ccondensation nuclei\u201d around which cloud droplets form. More or thicker\nclouds, in turn, also cast away more sunlight. So when we clean up pollution,\nwe also ease this cooling effect.\n\nBefore we go any further, let me stress: cutting air pollution is smart public\npolicy that has unequivocally saved lives and prevented terrible suffering.\n\nThe fine particulate matter produced by burning coal, gas, wood, and other\nbiomatter is responsible for millions of premature deaths every year through\ncardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, and various forms of cancer,\nstudies consistently show. Sulfur dioxide causes asthma and other respiratory\nproblems, contributes to acid rain, and depletes the protective ozone layer.\n\n> Air pollution is killing millions of people per year.\n>\n> It would be a vastly better outcome for humanity if we could cut it rapidly,\n> despite the resulting warming impact on the climate. https://t.co/JYWAWwVtiG\n>\n> \u2014 Zeke Hausfather (@hausfath) April 8, 2024\n\nBut as the world rapidly warms, it\u2019s critical to understand the impact of\npollution-fighting regulations on the global thermostat as well. Scientists\nhave baked the drop-off of this cooling effect into net warming projections\nfor the coming decades, but they\u2019re also striving to obtain a clearer picture\nof just how big a role declining pollution will play.\n\nA new study found that reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide and other\npollutants are responsible for about 38%, as a middle estimate, of the\nincreased \u201cradiative forcing\u201d observed on the planet between 2001 and 2019.\n\nAn increase in radiative forcing means that more energy is entering the\natmosphere than leaving it, as Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric\nscience at MIT, lays out in a handy explainer here. As that balance has\nshifted in recent decades, the difference has been absorbed by the oceans and\natmosphere, which is what is warming up the planet.\n\nThe remainder of the increase is \u201cmainly\u201d attributable to continued rising\nemissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, says \u00d8ivind Hodnebrog, a\nresearcher at the Center for International Climate and Environment Research in\nNorway and lead author of the paper, which relied on climate models, sea-\nsurface temperature readings, and satellite observations.\n\nThe study underscores the fact that as carbon dioxide, methane, and other\ngases continue to drive up temperatures, parallel reductions in air pollution\nare revealing more of that additional warming, says Zeke Hausfather, a\nscientist at the independent research organization Berkeley Earth. And it\u2019s\nhappening at a point when, by most accounts, global warming is about to begin\naccelerating or has already started to do so. (There\u2019s ongoing debate over\nwhether researchers can yet detect that acceleration and whether the world is\nnow warming faster than researchers had expected.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the cutoff date, the study did not capture a more recent\ncontributor to these trends. Starting in 2020, under new regulations from the\nInternational Maritime Organization, commercial shipping vessels have also had\nto steeply reduce the sulfur content in fuels. Studies have already detected a\ndecrease in the formation of \u201cship tracks,\u201d or the lines of clouds that often\nform above busy shipping routes.\n\nAgain, this is a good thing in the most important way: maritime pollution\nalone is responsible for tens of thousands of early deaths every year. But\neven so, I have seen and heard of suggestions that perhaps we should slow down\nor alter the implementation of some of these pollution policies, given the\ndeclining cooling effect.\n\nA 2013 study explored one way to potentially balance the harms and benefits.\nThe researchers simulated a scenario in which the maritime industry would be\nrequired to use very low-sulfur fuels around coastlines, where the pollution\nhas the biggest effect on mortality and health. But then the vessels would\ndouble the fuel\u2019s sulfur content when crossing the open ocean.\n\nIn that hypothetical world, the cooling effect was a bit stronger and\npremature deaths declined by 69% with respect to figures at the time,\ndelivering a considerable public health improvement. But notably, under a\nscenario in which low-sulfur fuels were required across the board, mortality\ndeclined by 96%, a difference of more than 13,000 preventable deaths every\nyear.\n\nNow that the rules are in place and the industry is running on low-sulfur\nfuels, intentionally reintroducing pollution over the oceans would be a far\nmore controversial matter.\n\nWhile society basically accepted for well over a century that ships were\ninadvertently emitting sulfur dioxide into the air, flipping those emissions\nback on for the purpose of easing global warming would amount to a form of\nsolar geoengineering, a deliberate effort to tweak the climate system.\n\nMany think such planetary interventions are far too powerful and unpredictable\nfor us to muck around with. And to be sure, this particular approach would be\none of the more ineffective, dangerous, and expensive ways to carry out solar\ngeoengineering, if the world ever decided it should be done at all. The far\nmore commonly studied concept is emitting sulfur dioxide high in the\nstratosphere, where it would persist for longer and, as a bonus, not be\ninhaled by humans.\n\nOn an episode of the Energy vs. Climate podcast last fall, David Keith, a\nprofessor at the University of Chicago who has closely studied the topic, said\nthat it may be possible to slowly implement solar geoengineering in the\nstratosphere as a means of balancing out the reduced cooling occurring from\nsulfur dioxide emissions in the troposphere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe kind of solar geoengineering ideas that people are talking about\nseriously would be a thin wedge that would, for example, start replacing what\nwas happening with the added warming we have from unmasking the aerosol\ncooling from shipping,\u201d he said.\n\nPositioning the use of solar geoengineering as a means of merely replacing a\ncruder form that the world was shutting down offers a somewhat different\nmental framing for the concept\u2014though certainly not one that would address all\nthe deep concerns and fierce criticisms.\n\n# Now read the rest of The Spark\n\n### Read more from MIT Technology Review\u2019s archive:\n\nBack in 2018, I wrote a piece about the maritime rules that were then in the\nworks and the likelihood that they would fuel additional global warming,\nnoting that we were \u201cabout to kill a massive, unintentional\u201d experiment in\nsolar geoengineering.\n\n### Another thing\n\nSpeaking of the concerns about solar geoengineering, late last week I\npublished a deep dive into Harvard\u2019s unsuccessful, decade-long effort to\nlaunch a high-altitude balloon to conduct a tiny experiment in the\nstratosphere. I asked a handful of people who were involved in the project or\nfollowed it closely for their insights into what unfolded, the lessons that\ncan be drawn from the episode\u2014and their thoughts on what it means for\ngeoengineering research moving forward.\n\n### Keeping up with Climate\n\nYup, as the industry predicted (and common sense would suggest), this week\u2019s\nsolar eclipse dramatically cut solar power production across North America.\nBut for the most part, grid operators were able to manage their systems\nsmoothly, minus a few price spikes, thanks in part to a steady buildout of\nbattery banks and the availability of other sources like natural gas and\nhydropower. (Heatmap)\n\nThere\u2019s been a pile-up of bad news for Tesla in recent days. First, the\ncompany badly missed analyst expectations for vehicle deliveries during the\nfirst quarter. Then, Reuters reported that the EV giant has canceled plans for\na low-cost, mass-market car. That may have something to do with the move to\n\u201cprioritize the development of a robotaxi,\u201d which the Wall Street Journal then\nwrote about. Over on X, Elon Musk denied the Reuters story, sort of\u2014posting\nthat \u201cReuters is lying (again).\u201d But there\u2019s a growing sense that his\ntransformation into a \u201cfar-right activist\u201d is exacting an increasingly high\ncost on his personal and business brands. (Wall Street Journal)\n\nIn a landmark ruling this week, the European Court of Human Rights determined\nthat by not taking adequate steps to address the dangers of climate change,\nincluding increasingly severe heat waves that put the elderly at particular\nrisk, Switzerland had violated the human rights of a group of older Swiss\nwomen who had brought a case against the country. Legal experts say the ruling\ncreates a precedent that could unleash many similar cases across Europe.
