Like\ngems, they exist in myriad bright colors: shiny blue, red, orange, leaf green\nand transparent flecked with gold. They\u2019re members of a group of 40,000\nspecies of leaf beetles, the Chrysomelidae, one of the most species-rich\nbranches of the vast beetle order, Coleoptera. \u201cYou have your weevils,\nlonghorns, and leaf beetles,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s really the trio that dominates\nbeetle diversity.\u201d\n\nAn entomologist at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Chaboo has long\nwondered why the kingdom of life is so skewed toward beetles: The tough-bodied\ncreatures make up about a quarter of all animal species. Many biologists have\nwondered the same thing, for a long time. \u201cDarwin was a beetle collector,\u201d\nChaboo notes.\n\nDespite their kaleidoscopic variety, most beetles share the same three-part\nbody plan. The insects\u2019 ability to fold their flight wings, origami-like,\nunder protective forewings called elytra allows beetles to squeeze into rocky\ncrevices and burrow inside trees. Beetles\u2019 knack for thriving in a large range\nof microhabitats could also help explain their abundance of species,\nscientists say.\n\nOf the roughly 1 million named insect species on Earth, about 400,000 are\nbeetles. And that\u2019s just the beetles described so far. Scientists typically\ndescribe thousands of new species each year. So \u2014 why so many beetle species?\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the precise answer,\u201d says Chaboo. But clues are emerging.\n\nOne hypothesis is that there are lots of them because they\u2019ve been around so\nlong. \u201cBeetles are 350 million years old,\u201d says evolutionary biologist and\nentomologist Duane McKenna of the University of Memphis in Tennessee. That\u2019s a\ngreat deal of time in which existing species can speciate, or split into new,\ndistinct genetic lineages. By way of comparison, modern humans have existed\nfor only about 300,000 years.\n\nYet just because a group of animals is old doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it will\nhave more species. Some very old groups have very few species. Coelacanth\nfish, for example, have been swimming the ocean for approximately 360 million\nyears, reaching a maximum of around 90 species and then declining to the two\nspecies known to be living today. Similarly, the lizard-like reptile the\ntuatara is the only living member of a once globally diverse ancient order of\nreptiles that originated about 250 million years ago.\n\nAnother possible explanation for why beetles are so rich in species is that,\nin addition to being old, they have unusual staying power. \u201cThey have survived\nat least two mass extinctions,\u201d says Cristian Beza-Beza, a University of\nMinnesota postdoctoral fellow. Indeed, a 2015 study using fossil beetles to\nexplore extinctions as far back as the Permian 284 million years ago concluded\nthat lack of extinction may be at least as important as diversification for\nexplaining beetle species abundance. In past eras, at least, beetles have\ndemonstrated a striking ability to shift their ranges in response to climate\nchange, and this may explain their extinction resilience, the authors\nhypothesize.\n\nThree species from the diverse Cassidinae subfamily of tortoise beetles.\n\nCREDITS L TO R: KENJI NISHIDA; HASSAN SALEM; KENJI NISHIDA\n\nComplicating the mystery of beetle diversity is the fact that some branches of\nthe beetle family tree have many more species than others. For example, dung\nbeetles, which spend their lives rolling deftly crafted balls of excrement,\nare only modestly diverse. \u201cThis family is around 8,000 species, so it\u2019s not a\nhuge group,\u201d says community ecologist Jorge Ari Noriega at Universidad El\nBosque in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.\n\nBy contrast, Chrysomeloidea \u2014 a superfamily containing longhorn and leaf\nbeetles \u2014 includes 63,000 species, while Brupestoidea, a group of metallic\nwood- and leaf-boring beetles also known as jewel beetles for their glitzy\niridescent colors, includes about 15,000 species.\n\nThis large variation in species richness among beetle lineages means that \u201cno\none explanation holds very well for any one group,\u201d says McKenna. Still, among\nplant-eating beetles \u2014 which make up roughly a quarter of all beetle species \u2014\na clear pattern is emerging. Based on genetic analyses of different beetle\nlineages, McKenna and his colleagues have found evidence that a major factor\nspurring beetle diversity was the diversification of flowering plants during\nthe Cretaceous period.\n\nBeetles are thought to have originated more than 300 million years ago, during\nthe Carboniferous period. But the explosion in their variety and number \u2014\nshown here at the level of beetle families \u2014 coincides with the rapid\ndiversification of flowering plants during the Cretaceous period (green\ncolumn) some 145 million years ago. Scientists believe the success of\nflowering plants has played a profound role in beetle evolution.\n\nDuring the Cretaceous period, which started around 145 million years ago, an\nexplosion of new flowering plant species spread across the Earth\u2019s surface,\ncolonizing many different habitats. Today, plants make up about 80 percent of\nthe mass of Earth\u2019s life. Making the most of plants as food is an ecological\nstrategy that has helped fuel the radiation of not only beetles but also\nherbivorous species including ants, bees, birds and mammals.\n\nIn the case of herbivorous beetles, their most species-rich lineages carry a\nfascinating assortment of genes that permit the digestion of plants, McKenna\nhas found. Many of these genes code for enzymes that help to break down plant\ncell walls, allowing access to sugars stored in hard-to-digest compounds like\ncellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. \u201cThe lineages that have these genes were\nthe ones that are so incredibly successful,\u201d McKenna says.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nLiving World\n\n### Tricks and traits that let insects take flight\n\nLiving World\n\n### How predictable is evolution? An ant-loving beetle holds answers.\n\nLiving World\n\n### The alien beauty and creepy fascination of insect art\n\nThese genes were ingenious adaptations that turned indigestible plant parts\ninto food. They allowed herbivorous beetles to eat more and different kinds of\nplants, which in turn enabled the insects to move into new habitats and occupy\nnew ecological niches. As plant-eating beetles spread out geographically and\nadopted different diets and lifestyles, the genetic differences between them\ngrew, resulting in new species.\n\nFor reasons unclear, some species of plant-eating beetles lost their\ndigestion-aiding genes as they evolved, including a gene coding for pectinase,\nan enzyme that enables the breakdown of pectin. Evolutionary ecologist Hassan\nSalem at the Max Planck Institute for Biology in T\u00fcbingen, Germany, explains\nthat to compensate, some beetles evolved a different strategy for eating\nplants: They forged relationships with bacterial partners \u2014 called symbionts \u2014\nthat also aid plant digestion.\n\nFor some beetles, these special symbiotic microbes became an alternate tool\nfor keeping plants on the menu, expanding the number of habitats where new\nspecies could evolve and thrive. For example, in the vast majority of tortoise\nleaf beetle species, the group Salem studies, it\u2019s not a genetically encoded\nenzyme that breaks down pectin, but a bacterial symbiont. The beetles get the\nbacteria from their mothers: Every time a female deposits an egg, she also\nleaves behind a capsule containing the microbes. The tortoise beetle embryo\ndevelops inside the egg, then burrows into the capsule to digest the symbiont\nabout a day before it emerges.\n\n\u201cIt's the first thing it encounters in life ... so it\u2019s a very intimate\nassociation,\u201d says Salem. When Salem and his team have experimentally removed\nthe microbe caplets from developing larvae, the adult, germ-free beetles that\nemerge have a high mortality rate because they can\u2019t access pectin in the\nplant cell.\n\nThe metamorphic life cycle of beetles is likely another driver of overall\nbeetle success. That\u2019s because beetles can exploit different ecological niches\nduring various stages, divvying up microhabitats and resources as they change\nfrom egg to larva to pupa to adult.\n\nIn addition to making plants easier to digest, some plant-associated microbes\nmay have paved the way for beetle diversification because they provide beetles\nwith predator protection. In the tortoise leaf beetle Chelymorpha alternans,\nfor example, a fungus called Fusarium \u2014 often found in crops like bananas and\nsweet potatoes \u2014 grows on the surface of beetle pupae during metamorphosis.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve demonstrated that if you remove the fungus, then ants readily find them\nand feed on them,\u201d says Aileen Berasategui, an evolutionary biologist at the\nAmsterdam Institute for Life and Environment in the Netherlands. Fusarium, in\nother words, may be shielding the beetles from harmful predators, further\nexpanding beetle territory and enabling diversification.\n\nBerasategui adds that plenty of bark beetles, like ambrosia beetles, also\nbenefit from Fusarium fungi, but in a different way. The beetles carry the\nfungi from tree to tree in specialized pockets called mycangia. Once the\ntree\u2019s fungal infection is underway, the beetles indulge in a fungi feast.\n\nAdapting to conduct this kind of agriculture \u2014 sowing spores that will grow\ninto food \u2014 has also helped beetle species to exploit new habitats. \u201cFrom\ntheir own nest, they take a little piece, and then ... fly to a new tree where\nthey start their own nest, they sow the new fungus, they generate this new\ngarden,\u201d says Berasategui. Called fungiculture, the approach has independently\nevolved in ambrosia beetles seven times. The evolution of new beetle species\nis thought to have been shaped by mutually beneficial relationships with these\nfungi \u2014 part of a 50-million-year history in which insects such as ants,\ntermites and ambrosia beetles have independently evolved to farm fungi,\naccording to a 2005 article published in the Annual Review of Ecology,\nEvolution, and Systematics.\n\nStay in the Know Sign up for the Knowable Magazine newsletter today\n\nPlant-eating beetles have evolved other innovations that may have allowed them\nto speciate more than other beetle groups. In the leaf beetles that Chaboo\nstudies, for example, the emergence in the fossil record of defensive fecal\nshields \u2014 structures built from a beetle\u2019s own excretions and sloughed-off\nskin \u2014 \u201ccoincide with massive species radiations,\u201d she says. Most beetle\nshield-users are solitary species, but some live in groups, arranging\nthemselves in formations that protect them from predators. Fecal shield\nprotection may have helped the beetles move into more open habitats, Chaboo\nsays.\n\nWhether they eat plants or dine on other fare such as carrion, beetles from\nall groups have evolved an impressive array of tools to solve many different\nproblems. In that sense, beetles are a microcosm of the tree of life, McKenna\nsays.\n\nResilient as beetles are, however, we can\u2019t take their survival for granted.\nInsect populations are in decline in many places \u2014 \u201cand, yes, beetles are part\nof that,\u201d says Beza-Beza. How they\u2019ll survive the impacts of humans is \u201cone of\nthe core questions right now,\u201d he adds, though he\u2019s betting there will be\nbeetles on Earth \u201clonger than there will be humans.\u201d\n\nBeetling away on scientific puzzles in the Central American cloud forest sky\nislands where he works, Beza-Beza has a special affinity for Ogyges politus, a\nbeetle species that lives and feeds on rotting logs. \u201cIt only occurs in the\nmountains next to my hometown,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it reminds me where I\u2019m from ...\nand that there are these jewels everywhere.\u201d\n\nCREDIT: NEWS AT ILLINOIS\n\n## Beetle tricks\n\nBeetle species have evolved an impressive array of physical talents. \u201cThey\nhave found solutions for problems that we might want to try to solve,\u201d says\nentomologist Marianne Alleyne. Her laboratory of Bioinspired Design at the\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign collaborates with engineers and\nroboticists in a quest to unravel beetle party tricks, like the impressive\nleaps of click beetles, which can propel themselves more than 20 body lengths\nstraight up into the air, without using their legs.\n\nRevealing the forces behind this explosive energy release with high-speed\nsynchrotron X-ray imaging, the scientists saw how click beetles use a hinge in\ntheir midsection to jump. A peg keeps the hinge braced until the latch is\nreleased. Then, with a click, the beetle unbends and springs up, \u201c100 times\nfaster than a blink of an eye,\u201d says Princeton University aerospace engineer\nAimy Wissa.\n\nTo jump, the click beetle uses the same engineering principle found in jumping\npopper toys, called snap buckling, says Carnegie Mellon mechanical engineer\nOphelia Bolmin, who led the study. In this way, click beetles create a maximum\nacceleration more than 300 times Earth\u2019s gravity. Alleyne hopes that the\nbeetle\u2019s biomechanics can inspire a legless jumping robot.\n\n\u2014 Lesley Evans Ogden\n\n10.1146/knowable-040324-1\n\nLesley Evans Ogden is a multimedia science journalist based in Vancouver,\nCanada.
