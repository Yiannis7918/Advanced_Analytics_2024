We lost one staff member due to\nCovid who passed away in the middle of it,\" Bonds said. \"So it was a pretty\ntough time, but to be able to give some financial bonuses back to them was\nalso a huge thing.\"\n\nThat $1 million came from President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue\nPlan, which was passed in 2021 to revitalize the economy and replenish\nAmericans' wallets. ARP's best-known initiatives included a fresh round of\nstimulus checks, expanded unemployment benefits, and monthly checks to\nparents. It also kept local governments afloat, allocating billions for areas\nto spend on wherever money was needed.\n\nYears later, that funding is still bolstering a whole slew of initiatives from\nsmall-town fire equipment to paying off medical debt to building new community\ngrocery stores. It's quintessential Bidenomics, to use the president's own\nwords: It's about \"building an economy from the middle out the bottom up, not\nthe top down.\"\n\nBut the problem is that sometimes everyday changes happening quietly in Middle\nAmerica are not flashy enough to rise to the top and capture the nation's\nhearts and minds. One thing is clear: Despite some tangible accomplishments,\nBidenomics is still not enough to tip the balance in how Americans view the\neconomy \u2014 or Biden.\n\nThat could also be because Biden has so far failed to pass most of the marquee\npolicies he pledged during during his campaign, like paid leave, minimum wage,\nor broad student-debt relief.\n\nInstead, the parts of his agenda that he was able to successfully execute\nbefore Congressional gridlock are being more acutely felt in places like that\nSouth Carolina fire house, a Phoenix semiconductor factory, and new pipes full\nof clean water in Pennsylvania. For all the Americans in between, who are\nfacing high prices and wages that can't keep up, it's not feeling like a\nbooming economy.\n\n\"Just because President Biden and the administration says things are good,\nthat doesn't mean that's how people feel,\" Alice Stewart, a veteran Republican\nstrategist for several presidential campaigns and a CNN political commentator,\ntold Insider.\n\nBut for the target groups seeing their everyday lives changed by Bidenomics\nfunding, it can make a world of difference.\n\n## The hidden wins from Bidenomics\n\nWith 2024 looming, and Americans dreary on the economy, Bidenomics is still an\nelusive beast.\n\n\"It's not just a messaging problem, it's a real problem,\" Stewart said. \"This\nis how people perceive the economy.\"\n\nAnd people really, really don't seem to like it. An August Gallup poll of\n1,014 Americans found that just 37% approve of Biden's handling of the\neconomy, a far cry from 57% back in February 2021.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSome of that disconnect might be because the bigger impacts of Bidenomics are\nhidden away in the nooks and crannies of the country.\n\nTake Rose Carter, the executive director of Alliance for Congregational\nTransformation Influencing Our Neighborhoods, an Ohio-based nonprofit. Through\na $150,000 American Rescue Plan grant, Carter was able to buy a truck and\nstart a mobile food market that helps serve populations, like senior citizens,\nwho might not otherwise have access to fresh food.\n\n\"It gives them more dignity,\" she said.\n\nLook at the Biden administration's bipartisan infrastructure law. That\ntrillion-dollar legislation will create millions of jobs per year, and help\nrebuild roads, bridges, and public transit, but it's a quieter build than,\nsay, free childcare, and it plays out in less-sexy sectors of the economy like\nmanufacturing and construction.\n\nFor Jodi Cutaiar, that legislation meant access to clean drinking water for\nthe first time in nearly seven years. Cutaiar, a 45-year-old mother in\nPennsylvania, has had to use bottled water for everything from cooking to\ncoffee makers since tests found her area's water was contaminated with PFAS \u2014\nwhat's known as \"forever chemicals.\"\n\nJodi Cutaiar and family Courtesy of Jodi Cutaiar\n\nNow, through a $3.68 million grant from the infrastructure law, the community\nwill get access to clean drinking water. The pipes are being laid, and houses\nare slowly getting hooked up.\n\nWhen her house is hooked up, the first thing that Cutaiar wants to do is fill\nup a pot with water from the faucet and make dinner.\n\n\"I want to cook from the faucet,\" she said. \"I know that sounds so simple and\nplain, but that's what I want to do.\"\n\n## But people really don't like Bidenomics \u2014 and it's hard to bridge that\ndivide\n\nThe economy right now is full of disconnects. By most measures, it's a booming\nlabor market. At the same time, gargantuan investments \u2014 like those in the\nAmerican Rescue Plan \u2014 led to an economic recovery from the pandemic far\nfaster than many anticipated. Companies have continued to add jobs and raise\nwages. GDP is growing. Bidenomics seems to be working.\n\n\"It's hard for most normal people to understand what the impact of Bidenomics\nis, because as president there's just so much that's out of your control and\nonly a few things that are actually in your control,\" Max Berger, a political\norganizer and consultant who previously worked for Elizabeth Warren's campaign\nand the Justice Democrats, told Insider. \"The parts of the economy that people\ndon't like, like inflation, are largely out of the president's control.\"\n\nIndeed, inflation seems to be the public's sticking point, especially housing,\nutility bills, and food. So it's understandable that people feel bad if they\nand their neighbors are all struggling to buy gas or afford a home.\n\nBidenomics, on the other hand, is not as visible as Biden intended thanks to\nCongressional inaction, Berger said. His now-defunct Build Back Better package\nwould have meant highly visible dramatic spending on big priorities like paid\nleave or affordable childcare. Instead, the things that did pass are mediated\nnot on a grand and public scale, but rather through things like the tax code\nor targeted grants.\n\nBerger said that while many feared Biden would be too weak on things like\nstudent loan debt, the administration has actually gone further than expected\n\u2014 something they deserve credit for. Even as broad student loan forgiveness\nfaces its own challenges, the Biden administration has already quietly\nforgiven $117 billion in loans for targeted groups.\n\n\"I think that would be felt by normal people much more directly if something\nlike Build Back Better had passed instead of the IRA,\" he said, referring to\nthe Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 another piece of smaller legislation that\nincluded some aspects of Build Back Better, but was more aimed at the tax\ncode, healthcare prices, and green energy investments.\n\nAmericans who are not part of targeted populations receiving these grants are\nleft to contend with sky-high prices on their own. Inflation, powered in part\nby firms hiding behind the guise of rising costs to hike up their prices, is\ndragging down Americans' wallets \u2014 and their views on the economy.\n\nThat all comes as Congress let child tax credit checks and other direct\npandemic stimulus lapse. All of those measures had tangible effects, and their\nabsence \u2014 which has led to child poverty doubling last year \u2014 is most likely\nweighing negatively on sentiment too.\n\nAnd then there are those who actually think Biden has spent too much money,\nblaming gargantuan legislation for the current state of affairs.\n\n\"Going out and touting massive spending packages and still trying to promise\nto relieve college loan debt for people doesn't fit well with hardworking\nAmericans who paid off their bills,\" Stewart, the Republican strategist, said.\n\nBerger said that the \"biggest thing\" Biden needs to do to get Americans to\nunderstand the importance of Bidenomics is \"to more clearly talk about how\nrebalancing the economy to benefit workers means taking on corporate power \u2014\nand that his program is about shifting power from the concentrated wealth of\ncorporations and billionaires to working people.\"\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: Highlights from the final presidential debate between Trump and Joe\nBiden\n\nEconomy Biden administration Jobs\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
