The light from far-flung objects in space is just\nnow reaching the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), enabling us to\nmap our cosmos as it was in its youth and trace its growth to what we see\ntoday. Understanding how our universe has evolved is tied to how it ends, and\nto one of the biggest mysteries in physics: dark energy, the unknown\ningredient causing our universe to expand faster and faster.\n\nTo study dark energy\u2019s effects over the past 11 billion years, DESI has\ncreated the largest 3D map of our cosmos ever constructed, with the most\nprecise measurements to date. This is the first time scientists have measured\nthe expansion history of the young universe with a precision better than 1%,\ngiving us our best view yet of how the universe evolved. Researchers shared\nthe analysis of their first year of collected data in multiple papers that\nwill be posted today on the arXiv and in talks at the American Physical\nSociety meeting in the United States and the Rencontres de Moriond in Italy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly proud of the data, which have produced world-leading\ncosmology results and are the first to come out of the new generation of dark\nenergy experiments,\u201d said Michael Levi, DESI director and a scientist at the\nDepartment of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab),\nwhich manages the project. \u201cSo far, we\u2019re seeing basic agreement with our best\nmodel of the universe, but we\u2019re also seeing some potentially interesting\ndifferences that could indicate that dark energy is evolving with time. Those\nmay or may not go away with more data, so we\u2019re excited to start analyzing our\nthree-year dataset soon.\u201d\n\nOur leading model of the universe is known as Lambda CDM. It includes both a\nweakly interacting type of matter (cold dark matter, or CDM) and dark energy\n(Lambda). Both matter and dark energy shape how the universe expands \u2013 but in\nopposing ways. Matter and dark matter slow the expansion down, while dark\nenergy speeds it up. The amount of each influences how our universe evolves.\nThis model does a good job of describing results from previous experiments and\nhow the universe looks throughout time.\n\nHowever, when DESI\u2019s first-year results are combined with data from other\nstudies, there are some subtle differences with what Lambda CDM would predict.\nAs DESI gathers more information during its five-year survey, these early\nresults will become more precise, shedding light on whether the data are\npointing to different explanations for the results we observe or the need to\nupdate our model. More data will also improve DESI\u2019s other early results,\nwhich weigh in on the Hubble constant (a measure of how fast the universe is\nexpanding today) and the mass of particles called neutrinos.\n\n\u201cNo spectroscopic experiment has had this much data before, and we\u2019re\ncontinuing to gather data from more than a million galaxies every month,\u201d said\nNathalie Palanque-Delabrouille, a Berkeley Lab scientist and co-spokesperson\nfor the experiment. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing that with only our first year of data,\nwe can already measure the expansion history of our universe at seven\ndifferent slices of cosmic time, each with a precision of 1 to 3%. The team\nput in a tremendous amount of work to account for instrumental and theoretical\nmodeling intricacies, which gives us confidence in the robustness of our first\nresults.\u201d\n\nDESI\u2019s overall precision on the expansion history across all 11 billion years\nis 0.5%, and the most distant epoch, covering 8-11 billion years in the past,\nhas a record-setting precision of 0.82%. That measurement of our young\nuniverse is incredibly difficult to make. Yet within one year, DESI has become\ntwice as powerful at measuring the expansion history at these early times as\nits predecessor (the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\u2019s BOSS/eBOSS), which took more\nthan a decade.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to see cosmology results from DESI\u2019s first year of\noperations,\u201d said Gina Rameika, associate director for High Energy Physics at\nDOE. \u201cDESI continues to amaze us with its stellar performance and is already\nshaping our understanding of the universe.\u201d\n\n## Traveling back in time\n\nDESI is an international collaboration of more than 900 researchers from over\n70 institutions around the world. The instrument was constructed and is\noperated with funding from the DOE Office of Science, and sits atop the U.S.\nNational Science Foundation\u2019s Nicholas U. Mayall 4-meter Telescope at Kitt\nPeak National Observatory, a program of NSF\u2019s NOIRLab.\n\nLooking at DESI\u2019s map, it\u2019s easy to see the underlying structure of the\nuniverse: strands of galaxies clustered together, separated by voids with\nfewer objects. Our very early universe, well beyond DESI\u2019s view, was quite\ndifferent: a hot, dense soup of subatomic particles moving too fast to form\nstable matter like the atoms we know today. Among those particles were\nhydrogen and helium nuclei, collectively called baryons.\n\nTiny fluctuations in this early ionized plasma caused pressure waves, moving\nthe baryons into a pattern of ripples that is similar to what you\u2019d see if you\ntossed a handful of gravel into a pond. As the universe expanded and cooled,\nneutral atoms formed and the pressure waves stopped, freezing the ripples in\nthree dimensions and increasing clustering of future galaxies in the dense\nareas. Billions of years later, we can still see this faint pattern of 3D\nripples, or bubbles, in the characteristic separation of galaxies \u2013 a feature\ncalled Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs).\n\nResearchers use the BAO measurements as a cosmic ruler. By measuring the\napparent size of these bubbles, they can determine distances to the matter\nresponsible for this extremely faint pattern on the sky. Mapping the BAO\nbubbles both near and far lets researchers slice the data into chunks,\nmeasuring how fast the universe was expanding at each time in its past and\nmodeling how dark energy affects that expansion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve measured the expansion history over this huge range of cosmic time with\na precision that surpasses all of the previous BAO surveys combined,\u201d said\nHee-Jong Seo, a professor at Ohio University and the co-leader of DESI\u2019s BAO\nanalysis. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited to learn how these new measurements will improve\nand alter our understanding of the cosmos. Humans have a timeless fascination\nwith our universe, wanting to know both what it is made of and what will\nhappen to it.\u201d\n\nUsing galaxies to measure the expansion history and better understand dark\nenergy is one technique, but it can only reach so far. At a certain point,\nlight from typical galaxies is too faint, so researchers turn to quasars,\nextremely distant, bright galactic cores with black holes at their centers.\nLight from quasars is absorbed as it passes through intergalactic clouds of\ngas, enabling researchers to map the pockets of dense matter and use them the\nsame way they use galaxies \u2013 a technique known as using the \u201cLyman-alpha\nforest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe use quasars as a backlight to basically see the shadow of the intervening\ngas between the quasars and us,\u201d said Andreu Font-Ribera, a scientist at the\nInstitute for High Energy Physics (IFAE) in Spain who co-leads DESI\u2019s Lyman-\nalpha forest analysis. \u201cIt lets us look out further to when the universe was\nvery young. It\u2019s a really hard measurement to do, and very cool to see it\nsucceed.\u201d\n\n(Credit: NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/P. Marenfeld and DESI collaboration)\n\nThis artist\u2019s rendering shows light from quasars passing through intergalactic\nclouds of hydrogen gas. Researchers can analyze the light to learn about\ndistant cosmic structure. (Click on the hotspot to see the Lyman-alpha\nforest).\n\nResearchers used 450,000 quasars, the largest set ever collected for these\nLyman-alpha forest measurements, to extend their BAO measurements all the way\nout to 11 billion years in the past. By the end of the survey, DESI plans to\nmap 3 million quasars and 37 million galaxies.\n\n## State-of-the-art science\n\nDESI is the first spectroscopic experiment to perform a fully \u201cblinded\nanalysis,\u201d which conceals the true result from the scientists to avoid any\nsubconscious confirmation bias. Researchers work in the dark with modified\ndata, writing the code to analyze their findings. Once everything is\nfinalized, they apply their analysis to the original data to reveal the actual\nanswer.\n\n\u201cThe way we did the analysis gives us confidence in our results, and\nparticularly in showing that the Lyman-alpha forest is a powerful tool for\nmeasuring the universe\u2019s expansion,\u201d said Julien Guy, a scientist at Berkeley\nLab and the co-lead for processing information from DESI\u2019s spectrographs. \u201cThe\ndataset we are collecting is exceptional, as is the rate at which we are\ngathering it. This is the most precise measurement I have ever done in my\nlife.\u201d\n\nDESI\u2019s data will be used to complement future sky surveys such as the Vera C.\nRubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and to prepare for a\npotential upgrade to DESI (DESI-II) that was recommended in a recent report by\nthe U.S. Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel.\n\n\u201cWe are in the golden era of cosmology, with large-scale surveys ongoing and\nabout to be started, and new techniques being developed to make the best use\nof these datasets,\u201d said Arnaud de Mattia, a researcher with the French\nAlternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and co-leader of\nDESI\u2019s group interpreting the cosmological data. \u201cWe\u2019re all really motivated\nto see whether new data will confirm the features we saw in our first-year\nsample and build a better understanding of the dynamics of our universe.\u201d\n\nDESI is supported by the DOE Office of Science and by the National Energy\nResearch Scientific Computing Center, a DOE Office of Science user facility.\nAdditional support for DESI is provided by the U.S. National Science\nFoundation; the Science and Technology Facilities Council of the United\nKingdom; the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; the Heising-Simons Foundation;\nthe French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA); the\nNational Council of Humanities, Sciences, and Technologies of Mexico; the\nMinistry of Science and Innovation of Spain; and by the DESI member\ninstitutions.\n\nThe DESI collaboration is honored to be permitted to conduct scientific\nresearch on Iolkam Du\u2019ag (Kitt Peak), a mountain with particular significance\nto the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation.\n\n###\n\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) is committed to\ndelivering solutions for humankind through research in clean energy, a healthy\nplanet, and discovery science.
