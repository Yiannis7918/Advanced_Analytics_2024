Read preview\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nAccess your favorite topics in a personalized feed while you're on the go.\n\nAngus Deaton is doing some rethinking.\n\nSpecifically, the 78-year-old Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist is re-\nexamining his views on major topics like unions, immigration, and global\ntrade.\n\nIt's a big statement from someone who's spent over 50 years studying\ninequality, welfare, poverty, and \"deaths of despair,\" and it comes as he sees\neconomics in disarray. His most recent book, \"Economics in America: An\nImmigrant Economist Explores the Land of Inequality,\" came out in 2023 \u2014 it\ncatalogs, among other topics, the role of economists in the US and tackles\nsome of the problems he's identified.\n\nWhen I asked Deaton what prompted his rethinking, which he detailed in a\nrecent article for the International Monetary Fund, he said there wasn't just\none moment that led to his evolving views \u2014 it's been a process, and one that\nhe's not alone in. He thinks there's a broader reevaluation going on.\n\n\"I don't think I've stopped being an economist, nor have I stopped thinking a\nlot of the things I thought about before,\" he said. \"It's just that around the\nedges, there are sort of assumptions that probably weren't true \u2014 and that\nsometimes we have to take a broader view of things.\"\n\nHe's fond of the phrase \"sandbagged by reality,\" which can perhaps explain why\nhe says historians tend to be critical of economists: The most efficient\nanswer to a problem doesn't always promote optimal well-being for the humans\ninvolved.\n\n\"When your views don't seem to help very much with reality, then maybe it's\ntime to think through what might be wrong with those views,\" he said.\n\nIt all comes down to the importance economists have placed on efficiency in\nrecent decades, as Deaton writes in his IMF piece. That's a shift away from\nnorms established by the likes of Adam Smith, which take into consideration\nethics and the ultimate well-being of the humans involved. Deaton attributes\nit to a decline in focus on \"welfare economics,\" which considers how money\ntranslates into well-being.\n\nInstead, Deaton said, economists are relying on outdated ideas around welfare\neconomics or, even worse, not learning it at all. Simultaneously, Deaton says,\nthe US is seeing societal qualms like rising suicide and alcoholism rates and\nthe opioid crisis.\n\n\"I think the country is in sort of a bad way, in spite of all this hoopla\nthat's going on about how well we're doing economically. And so I'm an\neconomist now sort of thinking, 'well, how should I change my practice of\neconomics a little bit?'\" Deaton said. \"And there were some things that I knew\nall along. I mean, one was just that well-being is a lot more than just\nmoney.\"\n\n## Unions: From a 'nuisance' to a lever of power\n\nIn Deaton's IMF piece, he writes that he \"long regarded unions as a nuisance\nthat interfered with economic (and often personal) efficiency and welcomed\ntheir slow demise.\"\n\nThat's not the case anymore.\n\nHe told me that, growing up in Britain, he saw public sector unions causing\ndisruption in the 1970s, such as during the winter of discontent when a\ngarbage collector strike left trash piled up on the streets and bodies went\nunburied \u2014 and not garnering much sympathy for their cause. In his view, the\nconsensus at the time had become that unions' work wasn't really needed;\nthey'd already created the necessary worker protections.\n\nHowever, as Deaton saw private union power decline in the US over the last few\ndecades \u2014 especially with the rise of union-weakening laws \u2014 in relation to\nlobbying power held by the corporate and wealthy world, working people were\nleft without a lever. He also sees a mismatch between government\nrepresentatives and the workers they're meant to speak for \u2014 Deaton points to\nhow, while most Americans don't have a bachelor's degree, that's not reflected\nin the halls of Congress.\n\n\"There's not much room for power in economics,\" Deaton said. \"We don't talk\nabout it very much, but historians talk about it all the time. And I think we\nought to be thinking about it more. And I think one of the problems with being\na working-class person in America today is just not having very much political\npower.\"\n\nUnions were also an important social force in the past, Deaton points out. As\nthe share of workers in a union has declined, the loss of camaraderie has\ncontributed to the current loneliness crisis in the US, especially for men.\n\nDeaton also noted unions' ability to secure wage increases for not just the\nworkers in unionized roles but for others in the same type of job.\n\nHe points to the recent United Auto Workers' strike. Economists might say the\nlogical move in the face of demands for higher worker wages would be for\nmanufacturers to make cars in China where it's cheaper. But that's not what\nhappened.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"It turns out that the manufacturers actually had quite a bit of profit\nmargin, which this strike forced them to share with the workers. That's an old\nidea in economics, too, but not one that's much currently practiced \u2014 that\nthere's actually a gap which is available for either profits or wages. And\nthere's a sort of class struggle over who gets that,\" Deaton said.\n\n## Free trade: From driving wealth to exacerbating inequality\n\nFree trade has earned Deaton's skepticism, especially for what it means when\nit comes to the workers at home.\n\nAs he writes for the IMF: \"I am much more skeptical of the benefits of free\ntrade to American workers and am even skeptical of the claim, which I and\nothers have made in the past, that globalization was responsible for the vast\nreduction in global poverty over the past 30 years.\"\n\nDeaton told me he'd been very influenced by economist Dani Rodrik, who wrote\n\"Has Globalization Gone Too Far?\" a book about how globalization might\nexacerbate inequities and social fissures.\n\nFor example, Deaton points to what's called the \"China shock,\" when China\nfirst emerged as a global trade and industrialization hub in the 1980s. The\nargument there was that, on average, that new flow of low-cost products was\ngood for America \u2014 even though many lost their domestic manufacturing jobs.\n\n\"The point is the people who lost their jobs lose money to the China shock,\nbut the rest of us get cheap goods at Walmart and Target or whatever, and the\ntheorem says the value of what we gain is more than the value of what they\nlose. The trouble is it's different people,\" Deaton said.\n\nCheaper TVs, for example, may not make up for a household breadwinner losing\ntheir livelihood. Meanwhile, company executives may benefit from both higher\nprofits and cheaper goods.\n\nHe said Rodrik made the important point that economists are right: Those who\nstand something to gain in trade gain more than the losers lose. But that gain\ncomes at the expense of redistribution, which may not be what one hopes for.\n\n\"Now the standard recipe, which the trade people in the textbooks say is, 'OK,\nyou can tax the gainers and give it back to losers,' to which I say, 'Oh, yes,\nwhen did you last do that?'\" Deaton said. \"And the gainers don't want to give\nit up because they think, 'Oh, we've done really well here. Why is the\ngovernment trying to take it away from us?'\"\n\n## Immigration: From benefits all around to a reason for lower wages\n\nDeaton makes a blunt point on immigration in his IMF piece: \"I used to\nsubscribe to the near consensus among economists that immigration to the US\nwas a good thing, with great benefits to the migrants and little or no cost to\ndomestic low-skilled workers. I no longer think so.\"\n\nHe told me that he's not referring to the current US border crisis \u2014 which is\n\"sort of a mess\" \u2014 but instead to the longer-term impacts on inequality.\n\n\"The increase in inequality has something to do with immigration,\" he said.\n\nIn his IMF piece, Deaton writes that \"inequality was high when America was\nopen, was much lower when the borders were closed, and rose again post Hart-\nCeller (the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965) as the fraction of\nforeign-born people rose back to its levels in the Gilded Age.\"\n\nWhile employers \"love it\" for the cheap labor, historically, working people\nand unions have opposed it, according to Deaton. And, more broadly, Deaton\nsays that the Great Migration \u2014 when a wave of Black Americans moved from\nsouthern states to northern ones in search of jobs \u2014 hypothetically might not\nhave happened were there an open immigration policy at the time. As Deaton\nnotes, factory workers in Chicago and elsewhere would've been happy to hire\ncheap European immigrants if it were an option \u2014 but that wasn't possible\nanymore, leading instead to Black Americans getting hired.\n\n\"That really changed the world in a way, and that may not have happened had we\nhad a much more permissive immigration policy,\" Deaton said.\n\nOne modern argument for immigration also irks Deaton. Many employers have\nblamed the lack of immigration for their staffing shortages, saying that they\ncan't staff up enough without an influx of new labor. Deaton said \"you\nshouldn't listen to people saying that unless they say something about wages.\n\"\n\n\"They say 'no Americans want to do this, and so we need immigrants,'\" he said,\nadding: \"What they mean is no Americans will do it at the wages that we'll pay\nimmigrants.\"\n\nAll told, while Deaton's shifting views might reflect the disconnect Americans\nhave been feeling over the past few years between rosy economic numbers and\ntheir well-being, there is a bright spot: He thinks what the Biden\nadministration's been up to is pretty good, even as \"a lot of economists are\nup in arms and saying, this is a disaster.\"\n\nAnd while Deaton said it's been a little scary to reevaluate his views\npublicly, he's been pretty insulated from the response. He doesn't use social\nmedia, for one.\n\n\"I just keep myself sane, and so I don't really care,\" he said. \"If by the\ntime you have a Nobel Prize, you're frightened of what people say about you,\nthen maybe there's something wrong.\"\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: Biden and Trump bet on Michigan for 2024, vying for union support\n\nEconomy Tariffs Immigration\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
