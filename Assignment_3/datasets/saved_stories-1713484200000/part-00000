But are these anecdotes truly\nreflective of reality?\n\nIs there a feasible route to mastering coding and securing a high-paying job\nin a fraction of the time it typically takes to complete a conventional\ncomputer science degree?\n\nWhile coding boot camps offer a promising avenue, they alone may not suffice\nto mold someone into a proficient developer. Continuous learning and hands-on\nexperience across diverse programming facets are imperative for evolving into\na proficient software engineering professional. The landscape for entry-level\ndevelopers can be fiercely competitive due to the influx of boot camp\ngraduates, underscoring the significance of distinguishing oneself with robust\nskills and practical experience.\n\nCoding boot camps cater to a wide spectrum of participants, ranging from\nnovices embarking on their coding journey to seasoned professionals seeking a\ncareer shift. These programs prioritize imparting practical tech skills\ndirectly applicable to real-world scenarios, as opposed to conventional\ncollege education, which often emphasizes theoretical concepts with limited\npractical utility beyond academia.\n\n### Are coding bootcamps shutting down?\n\nThere are several bootcamps shutting down for several reasons. One of them is\nthat placement rates have fallen well under 10%. Here is a list of coding\nbootcamps closed the curtains since 2022.\n\nTelegraph Academy started out as a Hack Reactor partner school coding\nbootcamp, then it shut down and got converted to Telegraph Track\n\n  * Orange Code School shut down.\n  * Viking Code School was acquired by Thinkful, then Viking Code School closed down.\n  * Alchemy Code Lab closed down.\n  * Juno bootcamp shut down.\n\nTo us, coding bootcamps are struggling to become a solution to the ever\ninflating IT jobs. Rectruiters ask for different kinds of recognition, one\nbeing past experience, be internship or co-op programs. However there are only\n2000 open intern jobs in Canada, and 1000 paid coop jobs overall.\n\nHowever, according to Workforce Canada, it\u2019s estimated that 1.4 million\nCanadian employees are tech workers and about 60 per cent of these employees\nwork for technology companies..\n\n### Do bootcamps offer a guaranteed placement?\n\nWe would be extremely extremely skeptical of this. No education provider can\nguarantee you a job and it\u2019s incredibly immoral to get people\u2019s hopes up like\nthat, bordering on being an outright scam. Bootcamps are there to teach you\ncoding not to get you a job.\n\nWhether or not you judge the teaching of a bootcamp to be worth the cost over\nall the thousands of free resources online is up to you. But do not be under\nany illusions that you are paying to get a job as a software developer.\n\nYou are not. We\u2019re seeing a lot of people coming out of CS programs with no\nmarketable skills and no real experience. The CS degree might get you past an\nautomated screening, but if you aren\u2019t especially good at web development \u2013\nit\u2019s not going to matter.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a different combination of backstory, education, and\nexperience \u2013 so, however that needs to happen. But just because a boot camp is\n\u201cfree\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be good or the right part of that equation.\n\n### When the economic conditions kick in\n\nWhen economic conditions become a factor, the viability of boot camps becomes\nnoticeably affected. Generally, it appears that boot camps perform relatively\nwell during prosperous times but present a riskier option during economic\ndownturns.\n\nConsequently, when considering both options, I still advocate for pursuing a\ndegree for better long-term return on investment (ROI) and greater resilience\nin the face of economic challenges, although not entirely immune to\nrecessions.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to pursue a degree at minimal cost, ensuring it is regionally\naccredited, to avoid excessive financial burden and maximize long-term ROI.\n\n### Bootcamps promising a job have rules you have to follow\n\nBootcamps that promise you a job often have rules you need to follow. You\nmight have to apply for a certain number of jobs every week or take the first\njob you\u2019re offered. Plus, there\u2019s usually a deadline, which can make you feel\nrushed to accept any job, even if it\u2019s not ideal.\n\nSome bootcamps might hide the fact that only a few out of a group of students\nactually land jobs quickly after graduating. They\u2019ll still advertise that\ntheir students can get IT jobs. Job guarantees usually come with deadlines,\npushing graduates to find work within a set time. This can lead to them\naccepting jobs that aren\u2019t the best fit and might not help their long-term\ncareer goals.\n\nAlso, some bootcamps with job guarantees charge a lot more for tuition. It\u2019s\nimportant to think about whether paying extra is worth it and if it actually\nhelps you find a better job. Another thing to watch out for is bootcamps that\nlet you pay later once you\u2019ve got a job. They might add extra charges during\nthis time, so you end up paying more than you expected.\n\n### Better ways to find a permanent IT job\n\nWe need a better way to provide permanent jobs to our IT workers in Canada,\nand BlueWave Labs is the answer to this solution.
