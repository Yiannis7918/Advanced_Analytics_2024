I didn\u2019t know there was anything especially miserable\nabout her marriage, although I\u2019d always thought she was way more fun,\ninteresting, smart etc than her, frankly, quite boring husband. (Having been\nstuck with him for several hours at a friend\u2019s wedding, I\u2019d often wondered how\nshe put up with him. But, who knows, he probably felt the same about me.)\n\nAnyway, even though I couldn\u2019t say I saw it coming, I wasn\u2019t honestly that\nsurprised. After all, she\u2019s not the first. She\u2019s not even the second or the\nthird. She is, in fact, about the fifteenth woman I know in their mid-40s to\nlate-50s who has turned around in the last few years and gone... Is this it?\nReally? For the next thirty-odd years? No ta.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear, these are not, on the whole, women in so-called bad marriages.\nAlthough I\u2019m inclined to think that bad is in the eye of the person who has to\nlie next to it in bed every night. They are not, on the whole, having affairs,\nalthough \u201cpeople\u201d often find that hard to believe (and are vocal about it).\nAnd they have not, again on the whole, been cheated on (although some have).\nThey are not even all suddenly \u201cfreed up\u201d by the kids leaving home (although,\nagain, some are). They have \u201cjust\u201d tired of the daily grind of \u201cacting the\nwife\u201d as my aforementioned friend put it. And all that that, even in 2024,\nseems to entail.\n\nLike so many other heterosexual women in traditional marriages (even if you\nthink it\u2019s not going to be traditional when you enter it, that you\u2019re\ndifferent, that you will never put up with that patriarchal nonsense) the\neffort was almost all hers.\n\nThe first of my friends to leave her husband turned out to be the advanced\nguard, not that we knew it at the time. She and her partner had been together\nmore than twenty years, had four kids, and despite them both having\nexcessively full-time jobs, albeit hers freelance, she had divided herself\nbetween the professional and the domestic for the bulk of those years.\nEverything else \u2013 a social life, an inner life, her health, friendships,\neverything \u2013 went by the wayside. Like so many other heterosexual women in\ntraditional marriages (even if you think it\u2019s not going to be traditional when\nyou enter it, that you\u2019re different, that you will never put up with that\npatriarchal nonsense) the effort was almost all hers. Well over 90% at least.\nIf she wasn\u2019t doing it, she was arranging for someone else to do it. If a ball\ndropped, no-one else was going to pick it up. (I\u2019ll never forget interviewing\nBBC news broadcaster Mishal Husain for The Pool a few years ago and her\ntalking about ordering nappies in bulk before going away for work so her\nhusband wouldn\u2019t run out...) And my friend\u2019s partner \u2013 charming, funny, a\n\u201cgood dad\u201d, definitely \u201cone of the good guys\u201d \u2013 just carried on regardless.\nDoubtless he absolutely would have collected the kids from school if one of\nthem got sick but, y\u2019know, he was at work. I guess it just didn\u2019t occur to\neither of them that so was she.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing remotely standout about this story. Just as there\u2019s nothing\nstandout about his genuine shock when she told him she wanted a divorce, nor\nabout the familial recriminations at her for \u201cgiving up on their marriage so\neasily\u201d(although interestingly none of these came from the kids who were like,\n\u2018well, yeah, of course\u2019), nor about the assumption that she must have found\nsomeone else because why else would she leave...? (For the record, she\nhadn\u2019t.) Why would anyone pull the plug if they didn\u2019t have another bed to\njump straight into?\n\nHow long have you got?
