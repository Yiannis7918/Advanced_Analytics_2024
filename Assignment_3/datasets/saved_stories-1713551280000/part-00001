It might last billions of years.\n\nFrom 'Dune' to Dogecoin, the first true backup of human civilization contains\na few surprises.\n\nBy Chris Taylor on April 13, 2024\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard\n\nThe moon's forever library and its landing site. Credit: NASA / Goddard /\nArizona State University\n\nUntil 2024, our lunar neighbor didn't offer much in the way of reading\nmaterial.\n\nJust four sentences were etched on old NASA landers, two on Apollo 11 and two\non Apollo 17, both with Richard Nixon's signature. Other visible words include\na memorial to fallen astronauts and logos on equipment (including Alan\nSheperd's golf balls). One visitor donated a book \u2014 astronaut David Scott says\nhe left his Bible atop a lunar rover in the Sea of Showers \u2014 but 53 years'\nworth of sunlight and gamma rays (which bombard the moon and break down paper)\nwill not have left it in readable condition.\n\nThen in late February, the moon received a massive donation of books \u2014 some 30\nmillion pages' worth, to be precise. Also in the collection: 25,000 songs and\na whole bunch of art.\n\nHow? Well, that groundbreaking lander Odysseus didn't merely deliver money\nshots from the moon's south pole, and it won't just be remembered for tipping\nover during landing. Something that landed right-side up is the first ever\nrepository of human culture on a world beyond Earth. The Galactic Legacy\nArchive is its official name \u2014 but informally, we're more likely to think of\nit as the moon library.\n\nNo books can be checked out of this library. The pages are etched in nickel,\non thin layers so tiny that you need a microscope to read them. (Forget\nmicrofiche, this is nanofiche). A good chunk of the archive, the digital part\nwith music and images, requires that you read the nickel-etched primer on\ndigital encoding.\n\nBut it's on one small disk that can fit in your hand, and that's one giant\nleap for library-kind. \"Nickel never decays and never corrodes,\" explains Nova\nSpivack, head of the nonprofit Arch Foundation that was making its third\nattempt to deliver the first off-Earth library. (This time it partnered with a\ncompany called Space Blue, which added more than 70,000 digital artifacts from\n222 Earth artists.)\n\n\" \"We can now say for the first time in history that civilization will not be\nlost.\" \"\n\nNow that it's in place, providing the tiny disks don't suffer a highly\nunlikely direct hit from a meteorite, the library \"will last for as long as\nthe moon,\" Spivack says. (Scientists' current best guess: the moon will stay\nin Earth orbit until the sun turns into a red giant, in 5 billion years'\ntime). \"Even if our planet is destroyed in a nuclear war, it'll still be\nthere. We can now say for the first time in history that civilization will not\nbe lost.\"\n\nSEE ALSO: Why landing a spaceship on the moon is still so challenging\n\nThe Arch Foundation's multi-year mission: place Galactic Legacy Archives all\nover Earth and around the solar system. It's good to have multiple backups.\nBut what are we humans choosing to preserve, and what does it say about us?\nSpivak gave Mashable an exclusive look. Here are six highlights that future\ngenerations, or alien civilizations, might find in the moon library. Some of\nit is sublime, some of it ridiculous \u2014 a bit like the thing it aims to\nrepresent.\n\n## 1\\. The earliest art.\n\nA cave painting with images of hands. Credit: The Arch Foundation\n\nCave paintings go back at least some 45,000 years. This early form of art was\noften a collaboration between generations centuries apart (such as the hands\nin the Cueva de las Manos in Argentina, above, painted in waves between 7,300\nBC and 400 AD). Thanks to this new wave of collaboration, copies of hundreds\nof cave paintings exist on the moon \u2013 the same moon those hunter-gatherers\nwould have seen most nights of their lives.\n\nMashable Light Speed\n\nWant more space and science stories in your inbox?\n\nSign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter.\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nIt's fair to say they never imagined their digits would be compressed into\ndigital files and blasted on a rocket to that mysterious orb.\n\n## 2\\. A version of Wikipedia ... that makes Elon Musk look good?\n\nThe moon library contains what you might call an extremely offline version of\nWikipedia, out of date long before it was sent. This English version's 6\nmillion articles were downloaded by the Arch Foundation in 2021, though the\n10,000 most-read entries were updated in 2022.\n\nWhat does that mean? Well, for one thing it means the version of Elon Musk on\nthe moon \u2013 his Wikipedia entry \u2013 is forever frozen in time before his\ndisastrous takeover of Twitter. Any aliens finding this archive will think of\nMusk as the richest person in the world (instead of, as he currently is, the\nthird) and will wonder what he's doing as an encore after the rockets and the\nEVs. Let that sink in.\n\n## 3\\. Dogecoin.\n\nBack in 2021, Dogecoin fans put together a tune about sending their favorite\ncurrency \"to the moon.\" Houston, we regret to inform you that the crypto has\nlanded.\n\nNot in the way the crypto bros intended, of course. Dogecoin's price hasn't\ngotten close to its 2021 high, let alone rocket higher. But now, along with\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the specs and design for this meme-based coin are\nliterally on the lunar surface. Billions of years from now, the human race may\nhave perished \u2013 but that side-eye shiba will live on.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n  * The U.S. is exploring a railroad for the moon.

They're not just rock legends, they're rock legends who made it to\nthe moon, man. Space Blue formed a partnership with Melody Trust, a company\nthat owns the rights to the masters for some 25,000 classic rock tunes in the\nlibrary; there's a special focus on 1969 recordings to commemorate the first\nmoon landing.\n\nRock fans can also rejoice at the fact that among the many images in the\ndigital archive is Pink Floyd's iconic Dark Side of the Moon album cover. \"See\nyou at the south pole of the moon\" doesn't quite have the same ring to it, but\nthat's where you'll find 'em.\n\n## 5\\. David Copperfield's magic secrets.\n\nYou may not be able to see the Great Wall of China from the moon, but you will\nbe able to see how David Copperfield \"walked through\" the wall in 1986.\nCredit: CBS\n\n\"If you want to know how I'm going to make the moon disappear, go up there and\ncheck it out.\" So said magician David Copperfield to Space.com about a\nsupposed upcoming performance that has yet to be announced. Perhaps\nCopperfield is waiting a while after the moon made its own spectacular\nperformance by totally blocking the sun across a swathe of the U.S. \u2013 who'd\nwant to follow that?\n\nRegardless, Copperfield's archive is contained in the library: all the details\nof his famous illusions, including the ones he performed at the Statue of\nLiberty and the Great Wall of China. Whether those artifacts last as long as\nthe moon library remains to be seen.\n\n## 6\\. Materials for worship ... including Dune\n\nEvery kind of civilization-rebuilding text you can imagine is part of the\narchive, courtesy of the Long Now Foundation, an institute creating long-term\ncultural libraries. So is every language known to the Rosetta Project, an\narchive of all known languages. Religions are well represented: the Bible, the\nTorah, the Koran, the Hindu Vedas and Upanishads, and Buddhist scriptures all\nlive on the moon now. There are images and stories from indigenous traditions\non six continents.\n\nPlus thousands of beloved novels, Spivak says: \"If it's an important book,\nit's there ... Harry Potter, the Foundation Trilogy, Lord of the Rings, Dune.\"\nWait, Dune? The story of a young aristocrat who becomes a God Emperor\nconquering billions of worlds? Let's hope we don't accidentally give the\naliens any ideas.\n\nTopics Books NASA\n\nChris Taylor\n\nChris is a veteran tech, entertainment and culture journalist, author of 'How\nStar Wars Conquered the Universe,' and co-host of the Doctor Who podcast 'Pull\nto Open.'
