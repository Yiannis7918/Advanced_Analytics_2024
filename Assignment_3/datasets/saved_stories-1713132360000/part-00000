I don\u2019t\n\nSome companies operate a draconian policy on drugs and other intoxicants.\nFine. But for me it\u2019s performance that counts\n\nGene Marks\n\nShare\n\nCannabis. Caffeine. Adderall. Xanax. Ritalin. Vicodin. Tito\u2019s and Jameson.\nThese are all legal substances in most states. Some can only be used when\nmedically prescribed. The others are used \u201crecreationally\u201d and more people are\nusing them than ever before. I know this because I know many of these people.\nThey\u2019re friends, workmates and even family. I\u2019m one of those people. Do I\ncare? Not one bit. We\u2019re all grownups, right?\n\nAs an employer, though, maybe I should care when my employees are doing this\non the job. It\u2019s no surprise that the use of substances while at work is on\nthe rise. A recent piece by Ella Glover in Dazed cites a survey from the\nAmerican addiction site DrugAbuse.com which found that 22.5% of people admit\nto consuming drugs or alcohol at work, with one in five using cannabis while\non the job. Glover points to the rise of remote work as the culprit.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t doing anything new with his recent Truth Social windfall | Gene Marks\n\nRead more\n\n\u201cIn a remote work environment, there is less risk (of being caught) and way\nmore temptation,\u201d she writes. This shift in the workplace \u201cmay enable someone\nto continue to use drugs problematically with little to no immediate\nconsequences\u201d.\n\nMy company is totally virtual. For all I know they\u2019re micro-dosing, toking,\nsnorting, injecting and doing shots all day. I can\u2019t be responsible for their\nbehavior, nor should I be. They\u2019re grownups and \u2013 as long as it\u2019s legal \u2013 they\nhave every right to do whatever they need to do to deal with life on earth in\nthese stressful times.\n\nBut what about on the job? I\u2019m betting that more people than I care to admit\nare on some type of intoxicating or behavior-altering substance while serving\nmy food, cleaning my hotel room or ringing up my groceries. Good for them. If\nI worked these jobs I\u2019d probably be doing the same. I had friends in college\nwho smoked weed before class and graduated with honors. I think a few of them\nstill do the same today as lawyers and accountants. Whatever.\n\nI have this attitude because that\u2019s the nature of many businesses like mine.\nMy people aren\u2019t driving trucks loaded with toxic chemicals, supervising\nchildren, flying airplanes or providing medical care. I don\u2019t have an office\nor production environment where the risk of an employee \u2013 like at a client of\nmine just a few weeks ago \u2013 needing a Narcan shot after collapsing in front of\na slitting machine can pose a danger to others and themselves. My people are\ndoing technical services and \u2013 like the cashier, the server, the hotel cleaner\n\u2013 if they make a mistake no one gets hurt or killed.\n\nWhich is why we don\u2019t have a drug policy. I do, however, have a performance\npolicy.\n\nIf there\u2019s a performance problem, then I\u2019m involved. And I really don\u2019t care\nabout the reason. Be it drugs, mental health, or just a bad attitude I can\nwork with the employee to get them help but at some point we\u2019re going to have\nto part ways. No harm, no foul. My main concern is that my clients are happy.\nI have a business to run.\n\nIf you want to have a draconian drug policy, go for it. Some of my clients do\nso because of the nature of their business, the culture of their workplace, or\ntheir moral position on substances. Fine. They oversee regular testing and are\nstrict about warnings, suspensions and terminations when certain drugs are\nevident. Also fine. They spend the extra time and money on doing this because\nthey feel that it\u2019s important to their business, their mission, their\ncorporate ideals. The federal government and most states allow this, as long\nas it\u2019s not overly discriminatory and there\u2019s a written policy along with\nreporting mechanisms and procedures.\n\nGood for them. But this model is not necessary for my company or for many\nother companies like mine. I run a small business and I have other things to\nworry about. I do not have the time \u2013 nor the interest \u2013 in monitoring the use\nof substances by my people. I\u2019m not their mommy and the risk is not big\nenough. I don\u2019t have an ethical problem with people that take substances. I\njust have a business problem when that use affects their performance ... and\nmy clients.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * US small business\n  * Drugs\n  * Cannabis\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Business\n  * Economics\n  * Diversity & equality in business\n  * Small business\n  * Retail\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
