Note that sales are still up on last year, but the\ngrowth rate has certainly slowed.\n\nI wanted to understand how Americans think about electric cars, and why they\nmight be reluctant to make the switch.\n\nBelow I\u2019ll take a look at data published by the Potential Energy Coalition.\nThis is based on a range of national surveys and messaging tests, with inputs\nfrom nearly 60,000 people.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Americans are some of the most reluctant EV adopters\nacross the world. In 2022, just 8% of new cars sold were electric.1 That\u2019s far\nlower than the global average (14%) and way lower than in the EU (21%), UK\n(23%), China (29%), and enthusiasts such as Norway.\n\nYou can see these comparisons \u2013 based on data from the International Energy\nAgency \u2013 in the chart below. We\u2019re still waiting for new IEA figures to come\nin for 2023, but I expect the overall differences between countries will be\nsimilar.\n\nAs we\u2019ll soon see, there is a large partisan divide in attitudes to EVs. But,\ninterestingly, in a poll conducted by the University of Maryland and the\nWashington Post, the same share of Republicans and Democrats owned one.\n\nThis is all to say that the US is one of the toughest markets to crack. If\nthings really get moving there, we can be much more confident about uptake in\nother countries.\n\n##\n\nMost Americans think they will buy an electric car in the next 10 to 15 years\n\nThe survey asked Americans if they expect to lease or buy an electric vehicle\nin the future and when they think this will happen. They had the option of\nchoosing \u201cNever\u201d.\n\nOver a third (37%) expected to lease or own one in the next five years. 60% in\nthe next 10 years. And around one-fifth said they would never have one.\n\nThe results are shown \u2013 broken down by Democrats and Republicans \u2013 in the\nchart below. Three-quarters of Democrats thought they would have an EV in the\nnext 10 years. Republicans were much less enthusiastic, which will be a\nrecurring theme for the rest of this article.\n\nStill, more than 40% said they would lease or own an EV in the next decade.\nThe same share said they would never have one.\n\nThe one downside to this question is that it asked whether Americans expected\nto own one, not whether they wanted to. Some might have said they would own an\nEV in the next 15 years because they would have no other option. Maybe they\nanticipate that new gasoline cars will be banned (which looks likely in some\nstates) or carmakers will stop producing them.\n\nIn that sense, it\u2019s not fully reflecting their attitude to EVs, but their\nexpectations for where the car industry is heading.\n\n##\n\nWhat do Americans think about the benefits of electric cars?\n\nElectric cars are becoming more popular, but there is still a lot of\nresistance among Americans. What are they skeptical about?\n\nPotential Energy Lab asked the public whether they agreed \u2013 on a 5-point scale\n\u2013 with a range of statements. A score of \u201c4\u201d or \u201c5\u201d was counted as\n\u201cagreement\u201d. Note that this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that everyone else\ndisagreed. Many people could have voted \u201c3\u201d \u2013 I\u2019d frame this as a \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d\nor \u201cneutral\u201d response.\n\nThe results are shown in the chart below (apologies for the density of\ninformation \u2013 if you want to explore the chart in more detail I\u2019ve put it\nonline via Datawrapper here). Again, it\u2019s split by Democrat and Republican\nresponses.2\n\nThere\u2019s a lot going on there, so I\u2019m going to zoom in on a few points.\n\nCost\n\nThis was the one question where Republicans and Democrats were in complete\nagreement. Up-front cost of EVs has been the biggest barrier to adoption. This\nmatches with other polls, where the purchase price has been the main concern.\nTwo-thirds said that the purchase price of an EV was higher, in a poll\nconducted by the University of Maryland and the Washington Post.\n\nThis is changing quickly though. The cost of new EVs is tumbling, and will\nlikely reach price parity in the next few years. With the US tax credit from\nthe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), EVs will soon be just as cheap. This is\nparticularly true for car leasing, where large up-front costs are not an\nissue.\n\nRange\n\n60% have range anxiety, and think EVs are not ready for widespread use for\nthis reason. The range of an average electric car is now more than 220 miles.\nMany high-end EVs are pushing over 400 miles. The average US driver travels\naround 30 miles per day. So a single charge should cover Monday to Friday\ndriving for most people.\n\nThe anxiety, then, is for more rare and longer journeys. A large build-out of\nimproved charging infrastructure will be needed to address those fears. Even\nthen, it will probably take some time before drivers get the confidence that\nchargers will be there when they need them.\n\nClimate\n\nLess than half think electric cars are better for the climate. Pretty damning,\nconsidering there is strong consensus that EVs have a lower carbon footprint\n(even when the electricity mix is pretty heavy in coal).3 Electric cars are\ncertainly better for the climate in the United States. We are clearly not\ndoing a good job of explaining this to the public.\n\nRepublicans scored particularly low on this, with less than 25% agreeing.\nDemocrats were also surprisingly low: less than two-thirds agreed that \u201cEVs\nhelp tackle climate change\u201d.\n\nClean air and environmental impact\n\nThe results were similar-ish for EVs cleaning the air, reducing pollution from\ntransport, and being better for the environment. Around half said this was\ntrue. Again, the evidence is very clear for the first two: clean air, and\nreducing pollution. I wrote about the pollution benefits of electric cars in a\nprevious article.\n\n\u201cBetter for the environment\u201d always seems like a fuzzy question to me. Does it\nneed to be better for the environment on every metric? If it reduces carbon\nemissions and air pollution, but uses more water, is it better or worse for\nthe environment?\n\nStill, I expect many respondents \u2013 in addition to not believing it is better\nfor the climate and pollution \u2013 picture the mining of critical minerals, and\nassume it\u2019s worse than gasoline.\n\nI\u2019ve written a lot about mineral demand, looking at the mining requirements,\nand human rights abuses. The amount of materials we\u2019ll need to mine will\nprobably go down in a low-carbon transition, even when we account for ore\nconcentration and waste rock. But, requirements for transport on its own\n(without electricity) actually go up a little when we include waste rock. On\nthis one metric, then, you might argue that EVs are not \u201cbetter for the\nenvironment\u201d. But it seems odd that this would completely outweigh the other\nenvironmental benefits they bring. Again, it\u2019s not a very clear question.\n\nLocal jobs and independence from foreign oil\n\nAmericans were pretty unsure on these questions. I would guess that many see\nthe transition to EVs as moving from \u201chomegrown gasoline car manufacturing in\nthe US\u201d to a \u201creliance on Chinese manufacturing and supply chains\u201d.\n\nIn the survey by Potential Energy, over half of Americans thought that\npurchasing an EV primarily benefits China.\n\nIt\u2019s true that China dominates global battery and mineral supply chains. The\nUS is trying to push back with a drive for domestic production, high import\ntariffs, and the exclusion of Chinese imports from tax credits. Still, I\u2019m\nsure many see this as clear evidence that EVs are a risk to US jobs, the\neconomy, and its independence.\n\n##\n\nHaving the freedom to choose is important\n\nOne of the main takeaways from the Potential Energy Coalition report is that\nchoice really matters. No one wants their options to be limited. No one wants\nto be told what to buy, or what car to drive.\n\nThe winning narrative from that report (shown in the figure below) is that\n\u201cEveryone, everywhere should have the choice to make their next car a clean\ncar\u201d. The focus is on clean, affordable, and practical. No surprise really:\nmake EVs affordable and easy for people to switch, and they\u2019ll do it.\n\nBut giving people the active choice to make the switch seems to be important.\nThat pushes us towards carrots, not sticks. People don\u2019t like bans or\nmandates. They do like tax breaks and incentives for clean energy.\n\nSource: Potential Energy Coalition. The Road to Clean.\n\nThis is a dilemma I might write about in a future post, as it extends well\nbeyond EVs. My general mentality around these technologies is that if you\nbuild good, affordable products \u2013 and give them adequate support \u2013 people will\nmake their switch on their own. This approach is more popular among the public\ntoo. The problem is speed. Will these changes happen fast enough without also\nimplementing sticks \u2013 bans, mandates, and restrictions? I\u2019m not sure. Probably\nnot.\n\nThe ideal approach is probably some combination of the two. But how to achieve\nthis while maintaining public support on both sides of the political aisle is\ngoing to be a struggle.\n\nSubscribe to get new posts in your inbox.\n\n1\n\nThis includes fully-electric and plug-in hybrids.\n\n2\n\nNote that Independents are not shown for clarity.

Charging for an hour a week\nat a public charger is going to be inconvenient. I expect as more locals buy\nEVs, there will be long waits for chargers, basically ruining one day a\nweek.Doing the math, paying for a charge up in public will actually cost me\nmore money than refilling my 2004 Prius. So I am not getting the savings\nalways extolled about with regards to EVs.Supposedly there will be less to\nbreak inside and require maintenance, but when I have spoken to EV owners they\nhave told me how expensive damages cost to repair, I guess because they are\nnot yet ubiquitous enough.I have been wanting an EV for several years, but I\ndon\u2019t make a lot of money. And I don\u2019t have a 220V outlet where I rent where I\ncould plug one in. Newer apartment buildings have parking spots for EV\ncharging. My unit is $2600 a month. Ones with chargers tend to cost more like\n$4K here. More costs.Here\u2019s my solution: mandate landlords install 220V\noutlets in renter parking spots by 2030.Start with buildings with over 100\nunits. Give them till 2026.Then those with over 50 have till 2027.Those over\n25 till 2028Those over 10 till 2029And all by 2030.The IRA gives tax rebates\nfor some of this. States should add more to reduce pushback from\nlandlords.Expand full commentLike (5)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n3 replies\n\nWilliam HuletHulet's Backgrounder4 hrs agoI understand why you didn't mention\nthe 300 kilo gorilla in the living room, but it needs to be mentioned and no\none else has mentioned this in comments, so I guess I'll have to do\nit.Electric cars are the wrong answer to the wrong question. We need a massive\ninvestment in public transit. We need more dense cities with a better mix of\ncommercial, residential, and, commercial properties---so people can walk,\nbike, and, take transit to shop and get to work. The only value I can see from\nelectric cars is that they have built up the technology that is making\nelectric bicycles affordable to the masses.Reliance on personally-owned\nautomobiles is an absolute blight on human society. It has led to grotesquely\ninefficient suburban sprawl.I don't expect you to never talk about EVs---\nsimply because a huge swathe of the population has been brainwashed into\nbelieving that they are in some sense 'a good thing' for them. But you should\nadd a boiler-plate disclaimer to the effect of \"the personal automobile is a\nblight on society and in a well-run society we would be moving heaven and\nearth to build better transit in more dense cities\" before you write any\narticle about EVs. Otherwise, you are just perpetuating more of the stupid\nnonsense that is screwing up the planet.Expand full commentLike (3)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n4 replies\n\n29 more comments...\n\nMy book is out in the US today!\n\nA data-driven look at our environmental problems and how to solve them.\n\nJan 9 \u2022\n\nHannah Ritchie\n\n226\n\nShare this post\n\n#### My book is out in the US today!\n\nwww.sustainabilitybynumbers.com\n\n37\n\nWhy we need to highlight stories of progress to build a better future\n\nFive reasons to highlight markers of progress, without falling into\ncomplacency.\n\nJan 23 \u2022\n\nHannah Ritchie\n\n193\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why we need to highlight stories of progress to build a better future\n\nwww.sustainabilitybynumbers.com\n\n32\n\nRepublican states are going strong on solar and wind, but not for the climate\n\nPeople are building clean energy for economic and energy security reasons, and\nthat's fine.\n\nJan 1 \u2022\n\nHannah Ritchie\n\n180\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Republican states are going strong on solar and wind, but not for the\nclimate\n\nwww.sustainabilitybynumbers.com\n\n49\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Hannah Ritchie\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
