But that fine line gets much, much messier\nwhen you throw generative AI into the mix.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nFamily Requests 'Mamma Mia\" Star Be Replaced With AI in BBC Documentary\n\nStudios Advertise $1 Million AI Jobs While Hollywood Writers Remain on Strike\n\n#### Related Products\n\nShop All Movies on Amazon\n\nWhat Could the Future of Medical AI Look Like?\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nWhat Could the Future of Medical AI Look Like?\n\nA24 learned that the hard way last night when it released a series of\npromotional images for Alex Garland\u2019s new alt-future dystopia movie Civil\nWar\u2014depicting intentionally hypothetical images of the reach of the film\u2019s\nfictional contemporary American civil war. None of the scenes, which includes\nsoldiers riding an armed boat outside a battle damaged Los Angeles, and the\nLas Vegas sphere turned into a blackened husk, and more, are actually based on\nthe events of the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nFamily Requests 'Mamma Mia\" Star Be Replaced With AI in BBC Documentary\n\nStudios Advertise $1 Million AI Jobs While Hollywood Writers Remain on Strike\n\n#### Related Products\n\nShop All Movies on Amazon\n\nWhat Could the Future of Medical AI Look Like?\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nWhat Could the Future of Medical AI Look Like?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that the images are not based on actual moments from Civil War is\nless of the problem\u2014more so is that commenters immediately started accusing\nA24 of using generative AI to create the images. There\u2019s definitely some\nelements that look weird, and indicative of the kind of things people point to\nidentity an image as having been AI-generated. The second soldier at the back\nof the patrol boat in the LA image (the second image in the slideshow above)\nhas his legs seemingly just blend and vanish into the boat itself, and the\nsame picture includes a massive swan, presumably meant to be a pedal boat, but\nit has an awkward mix of looking both like a real swan and having the\nartificial elements of a swan-shaped pedal boat, except not only does it\nactually lack a space for occupants to sit, it also towers over the two\nsoldiers and their boat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother image (the fourth in the slideshow) shows bombed out cars in a Miami\nstreet, but a prominently displayed car wreck on the left of the image appears\nto have three doors on one side. The fifth image depicts one of the Marina\nTower buildings in Chicago ablaze, while also putting it across the river from\nthe other tower: in reality, they stand right next to each other on the same\nside of the Chicago river. Even if these images were intended to be\nhypothetical scenarios, there\u2019s enough that\u2019s off about them that the\nInstagram post\u2019s comments are filled with people accusing A24 of using\nartificially generated images instead of paying an artist to render them for\nthem.\n\nio9 reached out to A24 to ask the studio to confirm whether or not generative\nAI was used in the creation of the promo assets, but did not yet receive\ncomment at the time of publication. However, an unnamed sourced described as\nbeing \u201cclose\u201d to the movie told The Hollywood Reporter that the images were\nindeed AI generated, and that A24 saw them as a continuation of Civil War\u2019s\nsurreal setting. \u201cThe entire movie is a big \u2018what if\u2019 and so we wanted to\ncontinue that thought on social,\u201d the source told THR. \u201cPowerful imagery of\niconic landmarks with that dystopian realism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the images are made with generative AI, then Civil War becomes only the\nlatest controversial step in the technology\u2019s encroaching presence in\nHollywood. Just recently the David Dastmalchian-starring indie horror Late\nNight With the Devil came under fire for briefly using a handful of images\nmade with generative AI, while before that Marvel Studios drew considerable\ncriticism for making the opening title sequence of its Disney+ spy series\nSecret Invasion with similar technology. In the wake of the 2023 Hollywood\nstrikes seeking formal protection for writers and actors from the use of\nartificial intelligence, from generated scripts to digital background extras,\nstudios wading further into the quagmire of the controversial practice by\nusing it to replace other artists in the pipeline\u2014especially ones involved\nwith such public-facing elements of the film like marketing is fraught\nterritory.\n\nAnd in the end, the question remains: did A24 really need to do this? In Civil\nWar, it has one if its biggest hits yet on its hands, earing it its highest\nbox office opening weekend so far to the tune of $25.7 million\u2014almost doubling\nprevious record holder Hereditary. Do AI-generated posters get even more\npeople in seats? And if they did, is it worth the ongoing backlash?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWant more io9 news?
