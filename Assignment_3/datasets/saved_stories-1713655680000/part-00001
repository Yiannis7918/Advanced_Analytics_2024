Earlier versions of the\nlegislation gave ByteDance just six months to find a new owner.\n\nTo fast-track the bipartisan legislation, House Speaker Mike Johnson combined\nit with a bill to allow the US to confiscate Russian assets, then bundled it\ninto a package containing aid bills for Taiwain, Israel, and Ukraine, which\nhave all been delayed for months amid congressional infighting.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThat package of legislation will head to the Senate in a matter of days, where\nit's likely to pass. In February, the Senate approved a similar $95.3 billion\npackage that did not include the TikTok bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican politicians have for years expressed security concerns over TikTok\nbecause ByteDance is obligated to share data with the Chinese government.\nTikTok has an estimated 170 million users in the United States alone.\n\nToward the end of his presidency, former President Donald Trump sought to ban\nthe app. He has since flipped on the issue, arguing that TikTok's demise could\nbolster Meta, Facebook's parent company, which he referred to as \"an enemy of\nthe people.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden has signaled his intent to sign the legislation next week\nif it passes the Senate. Even though the legislation could result in a forced\nsale instead of a full-on ban, TikTok's company leadership is fearing the\nworst and is expected to challenge it in court. Legal challenges could also\ncome from TikTok's users and creators.\n\n\"This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the\nUnited States,\" a ByteDance spokesperson said last month.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch:\n\nTikTok Congress\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
