The electric vehicle that looks like it was designed by a child already\nhas rust issues, doesn\u2019t do well with puddles, and some can\u2019t even survive a\ncar wash, but an issue that causes the accelerator pedal to stick finally\nprompted a recall.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nElon Musk's Tesla Trial Defense: Funding Was Secured...in His Mind\n\nElon Musk's Tesla 'Master Plan 3' Presentation Was a Chaotic, Boring,\nConfusing Mess\n\nTesla Investors Not Happy With Mr. Tweet's Tweets\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nTesla Investors Not Happy With Mr. Tweet's Tweets\n\nTesla will recall 3,878 Cybertrucks on Friday, according to a report from the\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Those vehicles have a\ndefect in which the pad on top of the pedal can slip off and get wedged into\nthe interior trim causing unintended acceleration. This defect is due to a\nlubricant that was used during the assembly process in order to make it easier\nto attach the pad to the pedal. Unfortunately, it appears that this workaround\nalso makes it easier for the pad to become detached from the pedal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nElon Musk's Tesla Trial Defense: Funding Was Secured...in His Mind\n\nElon Musk's Tesla 'Master Plan 3' Presentation Was a Chaotic, Boring,\nConfusing Mess\n\nTesla Investors Not Happy With Mr. Tweet's Tweets\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nTesla Investors Not Happy With Mr. Tweet's Tweets\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTelsa didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment about the recall.\n\nCybertruck owners affected by the issue will get their pedals replaced or\nreworked for free. Tesla has already begun addressing the defect in production\nand will apply the fix to trucks already at delivery centers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe issue of the stuck pedal started popping up at the end of March with some\nowners posting about it on social media. Last week, Tesla put a hold on sales\nof the Cybertruck as it investigated the problem. According to the NHTSA,\nthere have been no reports of death or injuries due to the defect.\n\nIt took years for the Cybertruck to make its way from an embarrassing stage\nreveal to people\u2019s driveways last December. Its \u201cunique\u201d design with a sticker\nprice starting at just over $80,000 has resulted in one embarrassing moment\nafter another. Musk, on the other hand, seems to be more focused on getting a\n$55 billion compensation package from shareholders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
