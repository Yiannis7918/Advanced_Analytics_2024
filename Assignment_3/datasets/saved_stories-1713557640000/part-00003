the Changes process. Change announcements (like the one you are\nreading right now) will still be sent to the devel-announce mailing list, but\nthe conversation about each change will take place on Fedora Discussion at\nhttps://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f40-change-request-privacy-preserv...\nThis will follow the same process as before, just with discussion in a\ndifferent format https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-\nUS/program_management/changes_policy/ You can subscribe to and interact with\nthese conversations by email. See\nhttps://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/guide-to-interacting-with-this-sit...\nfor detailed instructions. To make sure you do not miss anything, make sure\nthat you have the Change Proposal category set to \u201cWatching\u201d \u2014 or, if you just\nwant to get notified about new changes but not every reply in the\nconversation, to \u201cWatching First Post\u201d. (Click on the little bell icon at the\ntop right of the category page.) The below document represents a proposed\nChange. As part of the Changes process, proposals are publicly announced in\norder to receive community feedback. This proposal will only be implemented if\napproved by the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee. == Summary == The Red\nHat Display Systems Team (which develops the desktop) proposes to enable\nlimited data collection of anonymous Fedora Workstation usage metrics. Fedora\nis an open source community project, and nobody is interested in violating\nuser privacy. We do not want to collect data about individual users. We want\nto collect only aggregate usage metrics that are actually needed to achieve\nspecific Fedora improvement objectives, and no more. We understand that if we\nviolate our users' trust, then we won't have many users left, so if metrics\ncollection is approved, we will need to be very careful to roll this out in a\nway that respects our users at all times. (For example, we should not collect\nusers' search queries, because that would be creepy.) We believe an open\nsource community can ethically collect limited aggregate data on how its\nsoftware is used without involving big data companies or building creepy\ntracking profiles that are not in the best interests of users. Users will have\nthe option to disable data upload before any data is sent for the first time.\nOur service will be operated by Fedora on Fedora infrastructure, and will not\ndepend on Google Analytics or any other controversial third-party services.\nAnd in contrast to proprietary software operating systems, you can redirect\nthe data collection to your own private metrics server instead of Fedora's to\nsee precisely what data is being collected from you, because the server\ncomponents are open source too. Keep in mind this Fedora change proposal is\njust that: a proposal. It must undergo community review and must be approved\nby the community-elected Fedora Engineering Steering Committee (FESCo) before\nit can be implemented, just like any other Fedora change proposal. We welcome\ncommunity participation and fully expect this proposal may need to be modified\nsignificantly depending on Fedora community feedback. == Owner == * Name:\n[[User:catanzaro|Michael Catanzaro]] * Email: <mcatanzaro(a)redhat.com&gt; ==\nDetailed Description == We intend to deploy the Endless OS metrics system.\n[https://blogs.gnome.org/wjjt/2023/07/05/endless-oss-privacy-preserving-me...\nThis blog post] contains a description of how the system works. We do not plan\nto deploy the eos-phone-home component in Fedora. === How will data collection\nbe approved? === The proposal owners feel it is essential to ensure the Fedora\ncommunity has ultimate oversight over metrics collection. Community control is\nrequired to maintain user trust. If this change proposal is approved, then\nwe'll need new policies and procedures to ensure community oversight over\nmetrics collection and ensure Fedora users can be confident that our metrics\ncollection does not violate their privacy. We can say \"we would never collect\npersonally-identifiable data\" and write software that really doesn't collect\nany such data, but this alone will never be enough to ensure user confidence.\nWe will need a metrics collection policy that describes what sort of data may\nbe collected by Fedora (anonymous, non-invasive), and what sort of data may\nnot be collected. Such a policy does not exist currently. We will also want to\nensure the Fedora community has ultimate control over which particular metrics\nare collected. One option is that each metric to be collected should be\nseparately approved by FESCo. Collection of particular metrics in a particular\ndata format is ultimately an engineering decision, and therefore FESCo seems\nlike an appropriate approval point. Because FESCo members are elected\nregularly by the Fedora community, this also provides the community with\nultimate control over metrics collection via the election process. But other\noversight and approval structures would work too. === What data might we\ncollect? === We are not proposing to collect any of these particular metrics\njust yet, because a process for Fedora community approval of metrics to be\ncollected does not yet exist. That said, in the interests of maximum\ntransparency, we wish to give you an idea of what sorts of metrics we might\npropose to collect in the future. One of the main goals of metrics collection\nis to analyze whether Red Hat is achieving its goal to make Fedora Workstation\nthe premier developer platform for cloud software development. Accordingly, we\nwant to know things like which IDEs are most popular among our users, and\nwhich runtimes are used to create containers using Toolbx. Metrics can also be\nused to inform user interface design decisions. For example, we want to\ncollect the clickthrough rate of the recommended software banners in GNOME\nSoftware to assess which banners are actually useful to users. We also want to\nknow how frequently panels in gnome-control-center are visited to determine\nwhich panels could be consolidated or removed, because there are other\nsettings we want to add, but our usability research indicates that the current\nhigh quantity of settings panels already makes it difficult for users to find\ncommonly-used settings. Metrics can help us understand the hardware we should\nbe optimizing Fedora for. For example, our boot performance on hard drives\ndropped drastically when systemd-readahead was removed. Ubuntu has maintained\nits own readahead implementation, but Fedora does not because we assume that\nnot many users use Fedora on hard drives. It would be nice to collect a metric\nthat indicates whether primary storage is a solid state drive or a hard disk,\nso we can see actual hard drive usage instead of guessing. We would also want\nto collect hardware information that would be useful for collaboration with\nhardware vendors (such as Lenovo), such as laptop model ID. Other Fedora teams\nmay have other metrics they wish to collect. For example, Fedora localization\nwishes to count users of particular locales to evaluate which locales are in\npoorer shape relative to their usage. This is only a small sample of what we\nmight want to know; no doubt other community members can think of many more\ninteresting data points to collect. But note the purpose of all of the above\nmetrics is to inform specific design decisions, not to build tracking\nprofiles. We only need to collect data in aggregate, and have no need to\nassociate the data we collect with particular users. === Metrics transparency\n=== Transparency is required to provide confidence that Fedora metrics\ncollection is not creepy or invasive. Since Fedora is open source, a developer\ncan review the source code to verify exactly what it is doing and what data is\nbeing collected. But most Fedora users are not software developers, and few\nsoftware developers have time or inclination to review the source code of the\noperating system to see what it is doing. To retain user trust, we need an\neasy way for users to understand exactly what data we are collecting. We\npropose to maintain a documentation page showing the current metrics database\nschema, so users can see exactly which fields are in the database and what\nexample data looks like. Experienced users may gain additional confidence by\nbuilding and running their own metrics collection server; all of the\ncomponents of the server (discussed below) are open source, and we will\nprovide instructions for how to run a simple server yourself and view its\nmetrics database. You can redirect metrics from Fedora's server to your own by\nchanging a URL in a configuration file. === User control === A new metrics\ncollection setting will be added to the privacy page in gnome-initial-setup\nand also to the privacy page in gnome-control-center. This setting will be a\ntoggle that will enable or disable metrics collection for the entire system.\nWe want to ensure that metrics are never submitted to Fedora without the\nuser's knowledge and consent, so the underlying setting will be off by default\nin order to ensure metrics upload is not unexpectedly turned on when upgrading\nfrom an older version of Fedora. However, we also want to ensure that the data\nwe collect is meaningful, so gnome-initial-setup will default to displaying\nthe toggle as enabled, even though the underlying setting will initially be\ndisabled. (The underlying setting will not actually be enabled until the user\nfinishes the privacy page, to ensure users have the opportunity to disable the\nsetting before any data is uploaded.) This is to ensure the system is opt-out,\nnot opt-in. This is essential because we know that opt-in metrics are not very\nuseful. Few users would opt in, and these users would not be representative of\nFedora users as a whole. We are not interested in opt-in metrics. To make this\na little more confusing, metrics collection is actually separate from\nuploading. Collection is always initially enabled, while uploading is always\ninitially disabled. The graphical toggle enables or disables both at the same\ntime. That is, a newly-installed Fedora system will always collect metrics\nlocally at first, but the collected metrics will be deleted and never\nsubmitted to Fedora if the user disables the metrics collection toggle on the\nprivacy page. If the user leaves the toggle enabled, then the collected\nmetrics may be submitted only after finishing the privacy page. Metrics\nuploading will be opt-in for users who upgrade from previous versions of\nFedora Workstation, because we don't yet have a mechanism to ask the user to\nconsent to data collection after a system upgrade like we do for new\ninstallations, but metrics collection will be opt-out. That is, your upgraded\nsystem will collect metrics locally but will never submit them to Fedora. If\nyou visit the privacy page in gnome-control-center, then both collection and\nuploading will be either enabled or disabled depending on the user's\nselection. Unlike gnome-initial-setup, the switch in gnome-control-center will\ndefault to off if the user has not seen the switch in gnome-initial-setup and\nhas not previously selected a value for the setting. This might sound\ncomplicated, but it is consistent. If the user has not yet made a decision\nwhether to allow telemetry, we collect it locally so that it's ready to submit\nif the user approves telemetry in the future, but we never upload it. Once the\nuser makes a decision, then we either upload it or delete it and stop\ncollecting. === GDPR === It is Fedora Legal's obligation to ensure our data\ncollection complies with legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which Red\nHat operates. This is not an obligation of the Fedora community, so there is\nno need to discuss GDPR rules on our mailing lists. The proposal owners will\nnot respond to mailing list posts that discuss GDPR or similar legal\nobligations during this change proposal discussion. In short, let's keep\ndiscussion focused on what Fedora SHOULD or SHOULD NOT do, rather than what we\nMUST or MUST NOT do. That said, Fedora Legal has determined that if we collect\nany personally-identifiable data, the entire metrics system must be opt-in.\nSince we are only interested in opt-out metrics due to the low value of opt-in\nmetrics, we must accordingly never collect any personally-identifiable data.\nWe must also not collect any data that could become personally-identifiable if\ncombined with other data, which notably means IP addresses must not be stored.\nWe only want to collect anonymous data anyway, but we need to be especially\nmindful of the possibility that combining two \"anonymous\" data points could\nresult in the data no longer being anonymous. === Fedora data collection\npolicy === Fedora Legal requires that we publish a Fedora data collection\npolicy separate from the existing\n[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:PrivacyPolicy Fedora Privacy Policy],\nwhich is designed to address usage of Fedora websites. This is currently a\nwork in progress that we're not quite ready to share yet. You can expect it to\nbe very short and very generic. === Metrics server infrastructure === We\npropose to deploy Azafea, the open source metrics collection server used by\nEndless OS. An Azafea deployment consists of five components: an nginx proxy\nserver, [https://github.com/endlessm/azafea-metrics-proxy azafea-metrics-\nproxy], redis, [https://github.com/endlessm/azafea azafea itself], and a\nPostgres database. nginx proxies HTTP requests to azafea-metrics-proxy, which\nis itself a simple HTTP server that adds metrics into the redis database,\nwhere they will be fetched by Azafea and stored into Postgres. We will provide\ninstructions on how to set up your own server and see for yourself what data\ngets collected. === Metrics client infrastructure === The client side consists\nof [https://github.com/endlessm/eos-metrics eos-metrics],\n[https://github.com/endlessm/eos-event-recorder-daemon eos-event-recorder-\ndaemon], and [https://github.com/endlessm/eos-metrics-instrumentation eos-\nmetrics-instrumentation]. eos-metrics is a D-Bus interface that applications\nand services may use to record events, plus a GObject library that provides a\nsimple API around the D-Bus interface. eos-event-recorder-daemon is the\nservice that actually implements this interface: it collects incoming metrics,\nbatches them together, and sends them to the metrics server at predefined\nintervals. eos-metrics-instrumentation is the component that actually collects\nspecific metrics. Originally, we had planned to not use this component and\ninstead write our own fedora-metrics-instrumentation that would collect only a\nfew particular metrics that are approved via Fedora community process.\nHowever, currently we are planning to ship eos-metrics-instrumentation and\ninstead ensure that it is not collecting more metrics than would be acceptable\nto the Fedora community. A review process to decide which metrics to collect\nand which metrics to disable will be required. === Data set considerations ===\nAlthough we assume the metrics server administrator is not malicious and will\nnot actively attempt to deanonymize users, we will still take reasonable\nprecautions to make it difficult to correlate metrics to a particular user,\nstarting by not storing any IP address information in the metrics database.\nAdditionally, each metric that we collect will be considered individual, non-\ncorrelatable data by default, unless approved to be correlated with particular\nother metrics via future Fedora community process. That is, if a user submits\ntwo data points, we usually don't want the ability to know that these data\npoints were both submitted by the same user. Each metric is stored in the\ndatabase with a Unix timestamp indicating when it was generated on the client.\nIf abused, this timestamp could allow correlation of data points that are\ncollected at the same time as each other, or at a fixed time offset to other\nevents. For example, if the system were designed to collect two metrics\nexactly 300 seconds after the system were booted, then just looking at the\ntimestamps would be enough to determine that both metrics recorded at the same\ntime were submitted by the same user. Accordingly, we should consider\nmodifying the metrics server to reduce timestamp granularity at least\nsomewhat. === History === Currently Fedora's only form of metrics collection\nis [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/DNF_Better_Counting DNF Better\nCounting], but this only counts Fedora installations. That is useful, but we\nwant to count more than just how many users we have. Fedora's first metrics\ncollection attempt was [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smolt_(Linux) Smolt], a\nprecursor to hw-probe which collected data on user hardware. The current\nproposal is different from Smolt because it will collect more than just\nhardware data, and also because Smolt collected only opt-in data. The current\nproposal would be opt-out, not opt-in. This change proposal will likely be\ncompared to the Ubuntu spyware complaints from a decade ago, when Ubuntu\ndesktop users' search queries were sent to Amazon by default. Let's not do\nthat. == Feedback == We will endeavor to update this section of the change\nproposal to include a summary of Fedora community discussion of this proposal.\n== Benefit to Fedora == The main benefit to Fedora is that we will be able to\nuse collected metrics to inform design decisions. It is very common for\ndevelopers to wish to know something about how Fedora software is used, and we\nwill finally have a way to answer such questions. Occasionally, Red Hat might\nneed to collect specific metrics to justify additional time spent on\ncontributing to Fedora or additional investment in Fedora. == Scope == *\nProposal owners: This change requires substantial technical and nontechnical\nwork from the change owners. Most notably, we will need to package eos-\nmetrics, eos-event-recorder-daemon, and eos-metrics-instrumentation properly\nfor Fedora; they are currently packaged in a copr. We also still need to\nmodify eos-metrics-instrumentation so that it does not send events not\napproved for use in Fedora, as we expect to collect less data than Endless OS.\n* Other developers: This proposal will require substantial effort by Community\nPlatform Engineering (CPE) to host the metrics server infrastructure. *\nRelease engineering: [https://pagure.io/releng/issues/11514 #11514] * Policies\nand guidelines: New processes and guidelines are proposed above under the\nsection \"How will data collection be approved?\" * Trademark approval: N/A (not\nneeded for this Change) * Alignment with Objectives: This change does not\nalign with any current [https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-\nUS/project/initiatives/ Fedora Initiatives], which are very limited in scope.\nThat said, one of the main purposes of metrics collection is to determine\nwhether we are achieving other objectives not listed on the wiki page. For\nexample, we want Fedora Workstation to become the premier developer\nworkstation operating system. To that end, we want to know how many of our\nusers are using particular IDEs. == Upgrade/compatibility impact == We would\nlike to enable metrics upload for upgraded systems, but this isn't trivial\nbecause we want to obtain user consent before enabling metrics upload. This\nwould require us to design a user interface that would run on upgraded systems\nand present the setting to users. We have not yet created such a user\ninterface, so for now metrics upload will need to default to disabled for\nsystems upgraded from older versions of Fedora. Since the underlying setting\nwill be off by default, we don't need to do anything special to achieve this.\n== How To Test == The ultimate goal is to see metrics appear in the Postgres\ndatabase of a metrics server, but configuring and running the server is not\ntrivial. Accordingly, we propose to publish a separate document detailing how\nto set up and configure a metrics server for testing purposes, how to redirect\nmetrics to the custom server, and how to force the client to immediately\nsubmit metrics to ease testing. Although we don't actually expect many\ncommunity members to seriously run their own metrics servers, we still want to\ndocument the steps involved so that interested developers can see exactly how\nit works. == User Experience == A new metrics collection setting will be added\nto the privacy page in gnome-initial-setup and also to the privacy page in\ngnome-control-center. This setting will be a simple toggle that will enable or\ndisable all metrics upload for the entire system. Users who do not want any\nmetrics upload should feel confident that uploading can be disabled with a\nsimple toggle. Fedora users should be confident that Fedora metrics collection\nrespects their privacy and collects only limited, anonymous usage data. ==\nDependencies == Any package that wishes to collect a metric would need to\ndepend on eos-metrics. For example, if we were to collect statistics on which\nsystem settings panels are used most frequently, then the gnome-control-center\npackage would need to depend on eos-metrics in order to send a metric to eos-\nevent-recorder-daemon. == Contingency Plan == * Contingency mechanism: We\nwould need to remove the eos-metrics, eos-event-recorder-daemon, and eos-\nmetrics-instrumentation packages from the workstation-product comps group, and\nrebuild any packages that gained a dependency on eos-metrics. * Contingency\ndeadline: Beta freeze * Blocks release? Yes, if the change is incomplete, it\nwill need to be reverted before release. == Documentation == This feature will\ndepend on several different upstream projects with varying amounts of\ndocumentation. The client side consists of eos-metrics, eos-event-recorder-\ndaemon, and eos-metrics-instrumentation. The best documentation of eos-metrics\navailable online is its [https://github.com/endlessm/eos-\nmetrics/blob/master/data/com.endlessm.Met... D-Bus interface XML]. eos-metrics\nalso contains normal API documentation that will be built and installed in a\ndocs subpackage, but this is not currently available online. The eos-event-\nrecorder-daemon and eos-metrics-instrumentation components do not appear to\nhave any online documentation. On the server end, the metrics server consists\nof azafea-metrics-proxy feeding metrics into redis, where they will be pulled\nby azafea and then added to a Postgres database. Documentation for\n[https://github.com/endlessm/azafea-metrics-proxy/tree/master/docs/source\nazafea-metrics-proxy] and\n[https://github.com/endlessm/azafea/tree/master/docs/source azafea] can be\nreviewed online. [https://azafea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/events.html Events\nrecognized by the server are documented here.] Note that this documentation is\ncurrently focused on use by Endless OS rather than by Fedora, and includes\ndocumentation of many events that are no longer sent by Endless OS. This\nchange proposal does not propose to enable sending any particular events in\nFedora. == Release Notes == Release Notes are not required for initial\nproposal. We need to write the release notes before change freeze. -- Aoife\nMoloney Product Owner Community Platform Engineering Team Red Hat EMEA\nCommunications House Cork Road Waterford\n_______________________________________________ devel-announce mailing list --\ndevel-announce(a)lists.fedoraproject.org To unsubscribe send an email to\ndevel-announce-leave(a)lists.fedoraproject.org Fedora Code of Conduct:\nhttps://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/code-of-conduct/ List Guidelines:\nhttps://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Mailing_list_guidelines List Archives:\nhttps://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce@lists.fedora...\nDo not reply to spam, report it: https://pagure.io/fedora-\ninfrastructure/new_issue\n\nReply\n\nShow replies by date\n\nVitaly Zaitsev\n\nThursday, 6 July Thu, 6 Jul\n\n1:19 p.m.\n\nNew subject: F40 Change: Privacy-preserving Telemetry for Fedora Workstation\n(System-Wide)\n\nOn 06/07/2023 18:10, Aoife Moloney wrote:\n\n...\n\nThe Red Hat Display Systems Team (which develops the desktop) proposes to\nenable limited data collection of anonymous Fedora Workstation usage metrics.\n\nAll telemetry collection MUST be an opt-in feature (disabled by default).

I believe that Fedora has been hampered in the past by lack of\nreliable usage stats: we had difficult discussions about support for\ni686/python2/Qt3/etc where we just didn't know where the Fedora users were.\nTherefore, I personally think it is a good idea to allow collecting such\nstats, because I trust Fedora organization to keep such information to itself.\nFirst of all, I just don't see that large data brokers would be interested in\nPython3 adoption data, and secondly I hope that Fedora organization would have\nthe integrity (and the whistleblowers:) to protect that info even if there was\na temptation to let it out. Regarding the opt-in vs opt-out, someone made a\nclaim that opt-out is not compliant with GDPR, which doesn't sound right.\nEvery GDPR widget I have seen so far essentially asks if I agree with data\ncollection, and offers me an opportunity to opt out of everything but\nessential cookies, which seems equivalent to the 'opt-out' mechanism that\nMichael proposes.

(No, I don\u2019t quite know how that could be worded sensibly as a\npolicy.... but it\u2019s where I think I\u2019d prefer to start from). Even well\nintentioned things can be problematic. Did you know that \u201clshw\" does a DNS\nquery? Not only that, it\u2019s a DNS query not to where the distro points to, but\nsomewhere out on the internet. By running \u201clshw\u201d you\u2019ve now told a DNS server\nhow many machines / people you have running \u201clshw\u201d within some amount of time.\nYou\u2019ve also now complicated the ability to go \u201cI allow access to the packaging\nrepositories for security updates, the one two or three endpoints my\napplication needs to talk to, and if any of these machines EVER tries to do\nany other network activity, page people immediately as that can only mean\nsomething is wrong\u201d. This *really* isn\u2019t an unreasonable thing for people to\ndo, in fact I really, really, REALLY want to make it easy for people to do\nthis (and not start paging people just because someone diagnosing a problem\ntyped \u201clshw\u201d or something) For lshw specifically, this is fixed in c9s,\nFedora, and upstream now has an option to build with this feature disabled: -\nhttps://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/rpms/lshw/-/merge_requests/3 -\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098463 -\nhttps://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/lshw/pull-request/1 -\nhttps://github.com/lyonel/lshw/pull/86 Now, this example is obviously not that\nextreme or anything. It\u2019s arguably less information than what\u2019s in your\naverage `curl http://foo` <http://foo`/> request. But the burden we put on our\nusers is to evaluate each of these is to evaluate for them, in their\ndeployment and security context, if they are okay with a third party having\nthat information, and that they understand exactly what is being done, and\nwhat *could* be done with it. It sounds like a lot of work. An example of\nthis, the countme feature https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-\ncoreos/counting/ / https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-\nUS/infra/sysadmin_guide/dnf-counting/ / https://lwn.net/Articles/776327/ that\nlives as default on in Fedora (on my at-home personal Fedora machines too). I\nmade a personal decision for my own machines, but when looking at it in the\ncontext of building the next (now current) version of Amazon Linux, I was\nfaced with a choice: do we go through a process of independently working out\nwhat our customer thoughts would be on this feature, be prepared to set up our\nown infrastructure around it, how we\u2019d communicate about it, as well as ensure\nall of that meets the security and privacy bars we want to uphold..... or do\nwe just not enable it and spend that time on other things? We chose to spend\nthe time on other things, as setting this up was not critical for us. But what\nwas fantastic about this was that Fedora was very very very clear about the\nchange, how it worked, the efforts gone to etc, and it was so easy to flip\non/off and was really just in one place, and a place we would *have* to modify\nwhen we started building our own distro.\n\nReply\n\nMichael Catanzaro\n\nSaturday, 22 July Sat, 22 Jul\n\n7:42 a.m.\n\nNew subject: F40 Change: Privacy-preserving Telemetry for Fedora Workstation\n(System-Wide)\n\nOn Sat, Jul 22 2023 at 02:44:30 AM +0000, \"Smith, Stewart via devel\"\n<devel(a)lists.fedoraproject.org&gt; wrote:\n\n...\n\nI\u2019d almost prefer we work out a policy where anything of the sort is disabled\nby default, and with a distro-wide standard bcond to not even compile it in as\nan option.

Without that, no metrics. And nothing should have\na hard dependency on it, so no bconds should be needed. If you have some\ndenylist somewhere that throws an error if an unwanted package exists, that\nshould robustly ensure it's never enabled. For everything else, the test for\nwhether to send metrics is \"is the event recorder bus name owned?\" so no\nconditional compilation or bconds is needed.\n\nReply\n\nBj\u00f6rn Persson\n\nThursday, 6 July Thu, 6 Jul\n\n4:08 p.m.\n\nNew subject: F40 Change: Privacy-preserving Telemetry for Fedora Workstation\n(System-Wide)\n\nAs a non-user of Gnome 3 who normally never runs any Gnome 3 settings\nprograms, I get the impression that Fedora 40 will begin accumulating unused\nmetrics somewhere in the filesystem. To prevent a constantly growing waste of\nstorage space, I'll have to run one of two Gnome 3 settings programs \u2013 which\nmay or may not require starting a Gnome 3 desktop session \u2013 and find the right\nswitch to either turn on uploading or turn off collection. I'll have to\nremember to do that after upgrading around a year from now, and also on any\nnew installations in the distant future. If my impression is wrong, then the\nchange proposal needs to be amended.
