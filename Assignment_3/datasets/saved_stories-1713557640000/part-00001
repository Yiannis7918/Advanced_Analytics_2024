Read it here.\n\nGoogle employee protesters in New York on Tuesday (via No Tech For Apartheid)\n\nIn an internal memo Wednesday, Google announced the firing of 28 employees in\nconnection to a protest of Project Nimbus. The previous day inside Google\noffices in New York and California, a couple dozen employees staged a sit-in\nto bring awareness to the $1.2 billion Israeli government contract. It began\nin 2021 and provides cloud computing services to Israel\u2014specifically, we\u2019ve\nrecently learned, to the Israeli Ministry of Defense\u2014and though it has faced\ninternal criticism since its inception, efforts against it have naturally\nintensified since October 7th.\n\nThe memo from Google\u2019s global head of security Chris Rackow was ominous. \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re one of the few who are tempted to think we\u2019re going to overlook conduct\nthat violates our policies,\u201d he wrote to the company\u2019s thousands of employees,\n\u201cthink again.\u201d\n\nI was fortunate to speak with Hasan Ibraheem, one of the employees fired as\npart of the protest and an organizer with No Tech For Apartheid, Thursday\nafternoon by phone. It was shortly after news broke that more than 100\nColumbia students had been arrested by police in riot gear for a pro-Palestine\nprotest.\n\nIbraheem is a Syria-born, West Virginia-raised 23-year-old who worked at\nGoogle for one year and eight months. It was his very first job out of\ncollege. I asked him about getting arrested, how he found out he got fired,\nand his personal connection to this cause.\n\nOur conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMARISA KABAS, The Handbasket: How did you decide a sit-in was the best\napproach for this protest? And why now?\n\nHASAN IBRAHEEM, Former Google employee and No Tech For Apartheid organizer:\nThat's a great question. This campaign has been going on for about three years\nnow, ever since Project Nimbus was created. And throughout those three years,\nwe had tried basically every avenue possible to try and get the executives to\ntalk to us, at least have some sort of conversation with us, sent petitions.\nWe've exhausted every avenue that we could think of possible. And during that\ntime, we've been building up our supporters in Google\u2014everyone who's become\npart of No Tech For Apartheid. And then we wanted to do the strongest action\nwe could possibly do because we have been ignored for three years. They\nwouldn't even give a statement or a conversation with us. So we wanted to make\nit impossible for them to ignore us.\n\nKABAS: It's more than six months into the current war in Gaza and Israel. But\nyou said this effort precedes it. Do you think the current war accelerated or\nintensified your efforts?\n\nIBRAHEEM: Definitely. With the current genocide that's happening in Gaza right\nnow, more people were made aware. I joined No Tech For Apartheid only a few\nmonths ago. I wasn't even aware about Project Nimbus, and most of the people I\ntalked to in Google weren't aware of it until a couple days ago. So, people\nare receptive to this once they're aware of the contract, want to make change.\nBut yeah, it's unfortunate that it took a genocide for people to realize that\nGoogle is complicit in this.\n\nKABAS: Did you have any hesitation about organizing within your workplace?\n\nIBRAHEEM: At first I wasn't sure if organizing within the workspace was\nactually something that could lead to any real change. But I realized that it\nwould be better for me to participate and make my voice heard, even if I\ndidn't believe that the execs would drop the contract immediately. Some people\nneed to take the first step in organizing, and whether that means risking\ntheir jobs or doing whatever, I wanted to be a part of that first group of\npeople.\n\nKABAS: Can you tell me a little bit about what it was like being in the sit-in\nyesterday? What was that experience like?\n\nIBRAHEEM: We started at 12 p.m. and it was very quickly evident that the\nsecurity did not want us there. They tried to get us to leave as soon as\npossible. They removed our banner that was hanging off the side that was\nvisible from the stairs. And then an hour and a half in, the head of security\nwas very visibly upset and told us \u201cyou need to leave right now.\u201d And, as I'm\nsure you're aware, we were there for almost 10 hours. So an hour and a half\nin, him telling us that we needed to leave didn't result in anything until\nmuch later.\n\nIt was a lot of waiting but we, the people who were there in New York, me and\nthree other folks who were going to stay until arrest, we had each other and\nwe were making speeches, we were doing chants, we were making our voices\nheard, making our voices as loud as possible so that we could reach as many\npeople as possible. And lots of people came by and asked us what was going on.\nPeople were given flyers. And a lot of people were just concerned about the\nthings that we were talking about. They expressed solidarity with us. There\nwas a lot of support from Google employees.\n\nKABAS: And it was just you and three other people?\n\nIBRAHEEM: So in the very beginning, there were more. I think there were over\n10 people sitting down. But at an hour and a half in when security told us\nthat we needed to leave, we had different tiers of people who were willing to\ntake risks\u2014like risk of arrest or retaliation, which at this point seems like\nit wasn\u2019t at all necessary since we all got retaliated against in the same\nexact way. But for the people who were doing the sit-in and didn't want to be\narrested, they left as soon as security told them that they were going to\nescalate this issue and then it was just the four of us remaining until\narrest.\n\nKABAS: So when you were finally arrested, what did security say to you?\n\nIBRAHEEM: Security said, \u201cAlright, we've asked you to leave dozens of times\nnow. And you can leave now, it won't be an issue, or we can have you arrested\nfor trespassing.\u201d And a couple of hours before we actually were arrested, they\nhad put us\u2014the people who were sitting down\u2014they put us on administrative\nleave so that they could confiscate our badges. Because once you are put on\nadministrative leave, you don't have any access to your corporate devices. You\ndon't have any access to the building, and they just take your badges. So it\nwas only at that point that they could really charge us with trespassing.\nBecause before then, we were Google employees with active badges who had every\nright to be in that workplace. It took them until putting us on administrative\nleave that they could actually get the cops to come in.\n\nKABAS: That\u2019s actually helpful context because I was wondering how they said\nyou were on private property if you work there. So that was the way that they\ndid it.\n\nIBRAHEEM: It looked like they were genuinely, the entire time, just trying to\nfigure out what to do. I don't think that they had people do this ever\u2014Google\nemployees just refusing to leave as an act of protest. So they were struggling\nto figure out what the next steps would be to get us to leave.\n\nKABAS: When did you find out that you had been fired, and how did you find\nout?\n\nIBRAHEEM: We were arrested around 9:30 PM [Tuesday], then finally got released\nfrom the prison at like 2 AM that following day. So we were just there for\nfour hours. And then 7 PM that day\u2014so almost 24 hours after our arrest\u2014I was\nhaving dinner with one of the people I was arrested with and they just look up\nfrom their phone and say \u201cwe\u2019ve been fired.\u201d And then I checked my email and\nsure enough, we both had received emails just saying \u201ceffective immediately\ntermination,\u201d or something along those lines. And then we very quickly found\nout that more people were fired, and then Google sent out that email saying,\n\u201chey guys, we fired 28 of you.\u201d\n\nKABAS: If I understand correctly, some of the 28 people fired were not\nactually involved in the sit in. Is that right?\n\nIBRAHEEM: Yeah, this was retaliation, like completely indiscriminate\u2014people\nwho had just walked by just to say hello and maybe talk to us for a little\nbit. They were fired. People who aren't affiliated with No Tech For Apartheid\nat all, who just showed up and were interested in what was going on. And then\nsecurity asked to see their badge and they were among the 28 fired.\n\nThey had to reach out after the fact to tell us, hey, I was impacted by this.\nLike we had no reason to suspect that someone who wasn't affiliated with us or\nwasn't even wearing a shirt or anything related to our sit-in\u2014we had no reason\nto think that they would be retaliated against.\n\nKABAS: That's baffling.\n\nBack to the memo sent out to everyone from Chris Rackow, one line really\njumped out which is, \u201cIf you're one of the few who are tempted to think we're\ngoing to overlook conduct that violates our policies, think again.\u201d How did\nyou interpret that? Did you see that as a threat?\n\nIBRAHEEM: That's a threat. That is without a doubt a threat. They're just\nsaying, \u201cHey, don't even dare to think that you can do what these people did.\u201d\n\nKABAS: I think people define the effectiveness or the success of a protest in\ndifferent ways. How would you define whether or not this protest is\nsuccessful?\n\nIBRAHEEM: I believe it is successful right now, like just by the response that\nwe've seen. We did not believe that this one protest was going to get Project\nNimbus dropped. It was more that we believed that we wanted to encourage more\npeople to stand up against this contract. We wanted to activate more tech\nworkers, to let them know that there are people who are willing to stand up\nagainst their company's complicity in this genocide. So I think from the\nresponse we've seen, internally at Google, people supporting us and the people\nreaching out to join No Tech For Apartheid, I'd say this is a huge success.\n\nKABAS: Now that you're not able to protest from the inside because you're not\nworking there anymore, what do you hope that people who remain at Google will\ndo next?\n\nIBRAHEEM: I hope they organize\u2014maybe not the same action, but I hope they do\ntheir best to make their voices heard, because a lot of these people are just\nhearing about this protest for the first time. And we've seen so much support\nfor the people who have been arrested, for the people who have been fired, and\nwe've seen a lot of pushback against the email that got sent out. And I think\nall of these things together are making people realize, what's going on at\nGoogle? And I truly believe people are gonna make their voices heard\nregardless of the threat that was made.\n\nKABAS: What was some of the internal pushback about the memo?\n\nIBRAHEEM: I mean, very, very reasonably, we were seeing just responses from\npeople saying that like, it seemed threatening. That it seemed a bit much in\nresponse to Google employees just sitting-in, in their workspace peacefully,\nsaying, \u201cHey, drop Project Nimbus or come talk to us about it. Have some sort\nof conversation with us.\u201d It was a complete overreaction on Google's part to\nnot only fire everyone who was and wasn't involved, but then also threaten\neveryone else in the company who would dare think to stand up against this.\nAnd people are taking notice that it feels like a very fascist environment.\n\nBanner in New York office (via No Tech For Apartheid)\n\nKABAS: I was looking back, and in the past, Google employees have resigned as\na result of company retaliation against their activism and some, like you,\nhave been fired. Why in this specific case do you think they took the more\nextreme action of going straight to firing you?\n\nIBRAHEEM: I think they're scared. I think Google is genuinely afraid of their\nworkers standing up against this project. We know that we [No Tech For\nApartheid] are a worker-led organization, even though many times they have\ntried to paint us as an external group that doesn't represent actual\nemployees. But no, we are Google employees. That's why we all were fired. And\nGoogle understands the power that we have, and they are afraid that by more of\nus speaking up, that they will actually have to do something about it.\n\nKABAS: How can other tech workers support your efforts?\n\nIBRAHEEM: Share the story. Share as far as it can reach. Tell more people\nabout what we're doing. Speak out against your own company if it is complicit\nin this genocide. A lot of tech companies are\u2014Amazon is also in this [Project\nNimbus] contract with Google and Israel. And we have Intel who is also\ncomplicit in this genocide. So if you're at one of these tech companies, stand\nup against them, and if you're not, share the story. And I think we'll have\nmore ways to support our cause going forward.\n\nKABAS: What comes next for you?\n\nIBRAHEEM: That's a great question. I think 28 people right now are all trying\nto figure out what comes next. For me personally, I'm gonna continue to speak\nup against this as long as I can make my voice heard. Even if I'm not\ninternally at Google, I've been going to Palestinian protests. I will continue\nto go to more protests. I'll go to protest against Google. I'll go to protest\nagainst anyone who's complicit in genocide\u2014that's first and foremost. And then\nwe can figure out about getting a new job later.\n\nKABAS: And I'm just curious, do you have a personal connection to Palestine?\nWhat got you really clued into this particular issue?\n\nI'm Syrian. I'm Muslim. But I'm human, and that should be enough for anyone to\nhave a connection to Palestine.\n\nKABAS: What would be your message to the world right now?\n\nIBRAHEEM: Stand up and make your voices heard, even if it might be scary. Even\nif you might face retaliation. Even if you're alone\u2014because people need it\nright now.\n\n#### Join the conversation\n\nor to participate.\n\nThe Handbasket\n\n100% independent journalism by Marisa Kabas\n\nHome\n\nPosts\n\nAccount\n\nUpgrade\n\nAbout\n\nAbout\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Handbasket.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nPowered by beehiiv\n\n", "frontpage": true}
