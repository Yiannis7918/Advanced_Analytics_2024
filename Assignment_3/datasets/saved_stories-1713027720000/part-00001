During that time, we\u2019ve seen the\nincredible rise of remote work, followed by a decline as companies began\nforcing (or threatening) their workers to return to the office.\n\nBut what has happened in the past year? Is remote work on a gradual decline?\nOr is it here to stay? I decided to analyze 1M remote job openings in the past\n2 years to find out.\n\nHere\u2019s what I analyzed:\n\n  * How the % of remote job postings is trending in the past year\n  * What types of jobs are most likely to be remote\n  * Whether leadership jobs are more/less likely to be remote vs individual contributors\n  * How salaries for remote jobs compare to non-remote jobs\n  * Which countries are the most popular for remote work, and which has had the highest growth?\n  * Are remote jobs moving to other countries outside the US?\n  * Do companies with a remote work culture have a higher work satisfaction?\n\nNote: The job postings were provided by Revealera.com, a company that provides\njob postings and hiring trends data to financial institutions. These jobs were\na mix of jobs from huge public companies as well as small startups from all\ntypes of industries, and countries globally.\n\n### The share of remote job postings is up 10% from a year ago, and up 31%\nfrom 6 months ago, after a steady decline since mid-2022\n\nAfter a steady decline since early 2022, the % share of remote jobs is\nstarting to rise again. The % of global job postings listed as remote is up\n10% from a year ago and 31% from 6 months ago. Interestingly, the share of\nremote jobs has increased even more in public companies than in startups.\n\nThe share of remote job postings for public companies rose 45% from a year\nago, and is almost at its all-time high in early 2022. In contrast, for\nstartups, the share rose just 9.8% from a year ago.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that I\u2019m looking at % of jobs that are remote, *not*\nraw numbers. The raw # of remote job openings have decreased from a year ago\nbut that isn\u2019t because companies are moving away from remote work, but because\nof tech layoffs that are happening across the board.\n\nBut still, why the recent increase percentage-wise? I don\u2019t have definitive\nreasons, but for starters, I think a lot of return to office initiatives are\nfinally over.\n\nSecond, companies are focused on cutting costs as much as possible. They\u2019re\nlooking for ways to save costs on real estate, and labor. And remote work\nhelps with that. It opens up the talent pool by allowing companies to find\ntalent in places with a lower cost of labor. After all, why hire that\ndeveloper in SF who demands $250K, when you can hire someone just as capable\nin Michigan for $200K?\n\nUnless there is another pandemic, we probably won\u2019t be seeing a huge steep\nrise in remote jobs. But it seems most of the RTO initiatives has passed, and\nwe may be seeing a \u201cnew normal\u201d and the start of a slow secular increase in\nremote work.\n\n### Account executives, software engineers and digital marketers are the top 3\nmost popular remote jobs\n\nWhich job titles have the most popular remote jobs?\n\nIf we look at just pure volume, account executives/managers, software\nengineers and digital marketers make up the vast majority of remote job\nopenings.\n\nHowever, I think a more interesting analysis would be which jobs are *more\nlikely* to be more remote-based. For this exercise, I took the total # of jobs\nlisted for each job title, and calculated the % that were remote.\n\nIf we calculated this way, technical writers, customer success specialists and\nproduct designers are the most likely jobs to be remote.\n\n### Director, VP and Management job openings are more likely to be remote than\nIndividual Contributors\n\nThis was the most surprising finding. 5.4% of all white collar job postings in\nthe VP and Director level from public companies were remote, while only 3% of\nindividual contributor (non-management) job postings were remote.\n\nThis was a bit counterintuitive to me because I always thought specialized\nroles were more conducive to being remote, while senior leadership roles\ntypically involve a significant amount of communication, which usually benefit\nfrom in-person interactions.\n\nRemote jobs also require a bit more experience than non-remote jobs. The\naverage # of years of experienced required in remote jobs was 5.3, a bit more\nthan the 4.3 years of experience required for non-remote jobs (with the same\njob title).\n\nAmong all the different levels, entry-level jobs were the least likely to be\nremote at 2.48%, while senior-level jobs were the most likely at 5.35%.\n\nPutting all this data together, I think the story here is that companies\nsimply require an enormous amount of trust in hiring someone to work remotely,\nand as a result, they\u2019re more likely to give a remote job to senior leaders\nand people with lots of experience.\n\nI think there\u2019s also something to be said here for preferences based on what\ngeneration you\u2019re in as well. Gen Z prefer working in the office, and the\nbenefits it brings such as networking, mentorship and a structured\nenvironment. While older workers may have families and kids to take care and\nprefer working remotely.\n\n### Preferences for remote work depends on the profession and industry\n\nPreferences for remote work also differ, depending on what profession and\nindustry you\u2019re in. I conducted a poll on Blind, a tech community mostly\nfrequented by software engineers, and 66% of them told me they would prefer to\nwork remotely 5 days a week.\n\nI conducted the same poll to my Twitter audience (the vast majority of whom\nare in the financial/investment industry), and only 36% of them chose 5 days a\nweek. 27% of them even would prefer working remotely just 1-2 days a week. A\nhuge difference.\n\nI think these poll results underscore the cultural differences between the\ntech and financial sectors, and the importance of culture fit when recruiting.\n\nSomeone who has all the credentials and experience, but has mostly worked in\ntech companies might not fit in a company like JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs,\nwhere employees not only are expected to work most days in the office, but\n*want* to be in the office.\n\n### Salaries for remote job openings are essentially the same as average\nsalaries for non-remote job openings\n\nDo remote workers earn less than their non-remote counterparts? According to\nthe data, the answer is no. Salaries for remote jobs are essentially the same\nas salaries for non-remote jobs, when controlling for years of experience and\njob titles.\n\nHere\u2019s what I did to find the answer: I took the 50 most popular job titles in\nremote job postings, and for each job title, calculated the average midpoint\nin salary ranges of all remote jobs with that job title since Jan 1, 2023 ,\nand compared it to the average midpoint in salary ranges of all non-remote\njobs with the same criteria.\n\nOn average, among all 50 job titles, the average salary for non-remote job\npostings was 0.6% higher than remote job postings (which is essentially 0, if\nwe account for a margin of error).\n\nHow does this reconcile with conflicting studies that say remote workers get\npaid less than in-office workers? I think there\u2019s several things to point out.\nOne is that those other studies don\u2019t control for job titles. They\u2019re\ncomparing apples to oranges. They\u2019re comparing all jobs that are remote with\nall jobs that are hybrid/in-office, even though the mix for both of them are\nnot the same. Whereas I tried to compare apples and apples, by comparing\nsalary ranges in remote jobs vs non-remote jobs with the same job title and\nyears of experience.\n\nHowever, I will caveat by saying that there might be a bias in play here. For\ninstance, it might be that companies that have a remote-work culture might\nsimply pay more in general than companies that don\u2019t have a friendly remote\nwork culture. This could be because they\u2019re more likely to be tech or upscale\ncompanies. So it might make more sense that remote jobs pay more than non-\nremote jobs, even for the same job title.\n\n### Ukraine, Brazil and Poland have the highest % of white-collar jobs that\nare remote. France, Germany and India had the lowest\n\nWhich countries lead the way when it comes to remote work? Among countries\nwith at least 1000 remote job openings last year, Ukraine, Brazil and Poland\nled the way. On the other hand, Australia, India and France were among the\ncountries with the lowest % of remote job openings. I thought it would be\ninteresting to compare this with the best countries for remote work published\nby Remote.com. The 2 countries that made it to the top 5 in both lists were\nSpain and Portugal.\n\nCompared to 2022, there really wasn\u2019t much of a difference. But the countries\nwith the largest growth in % of remote job openings were New Zealand, Portugal\nand Spain. Countries with the largest decline in % remote jobs were Poland,\nCanada and Italy.\n\n### Remote Jobs from US Companies have mostly stayed inside the US\n\nAre US companies hiring more remote workers from overseas? I measured the % of\nremote jobs from US-based companies that are based inside the US, and the %\nhas remained steady at 75% since 2020.\n\nWhile globalization is a significant force, for remote work, there\u2019s still a\nstrong inclination towards hiring within the national borders, potentially for\nreasons of legal compliance, logistical simplicity, and workforce management.\n\nThis trend is pretty consistent, no matter what type of jobs I looked at,\nwhether it was software engineering or customer service.\n\n### Companies with a mostly remote work culture had an average Glassdoor\nrating of 3.8 vs 3.4 for the average company\n\nDoes remote work correlate strongly with work satisfaction? I analyzed 100\ncompanies with the highest % of remote jobs overall, and their average\nGlassdoor rating was 3.8, which is higher than the average Glassdoor rating of\n3.4 for all companies.\n\nCorrelation isn\u2019t causation, and of course compensation, benefits and work-\nlife balance all matters, but this does suggest a strong relationship between\nhaving a remote work culture and work satisfaction.\n\nUnfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to pick out companies that had a hybrid work\npolicy easily, but it would\u2019ve been interesting to see if fully remote\ncompanies had higher satisfaction ratings than companies with hybrid work\npolicies.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\n\nI think it\u2019s safe to say from that data that remote work is far from dead. In\nfact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the share of remote jobs increase even\nmore in the next year or so, as the job market slowly reverses from being just\nan employer\u2019s market.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of my findings:\n\n  * % of remote jobs have started increasing since mid-2022, and is up 10% year over year.\n  * Senior leadership jobs are more likely to be remote than individual contributors\n  * Remote jobs require more experience than non-remote jobs\n  * Entry-level jobs have the lowest % of remote jobs compared to mid-level and senior-level jobs\n  * Average salaries for remote jobs are essentially the same as salaries for non-remote jobs\n  * US-based companies have continued hiring remote workers within the US rather than abroad\n  * Companies with a remote work culture have a higher Glassdoor rating than the average company\n\n## Subscribe to get more data-driven research on hiring, labor and AI trends\n\nFuture articles will include: outsourcing trends, our best attempt to use data\nto find out which careers are least likely to be replaced by AI, and more! No\nfluff, no armchair predictions, just refreshing research backed by DATA\n\n### Methodology (the boring stuff)\n\nI analyzed job openings from a mix of ~3500 public companies and 1800 startups\nfor this study. To determine if a job was remote, I simply looked for the work\n\u2018remote\u2019 (and it\u2019s foreign equivalents) in the location field. I also tried to\nexclude jobs that mentioned Hybrid anywhere in the location field, or\nmentioned \u2018hybrid\u2019 in the job description to try and exclude hybrid jobs.\nCountries were also determined from the location field, so a job that listed\nas \u201cUK-Remote\u201d or \u201cLondon Remote\u201d was determined to be a job that was targeted\nto workers to that country.\n\nJob titles were normalized using a machine learning algorithm I developed to\nconvert a job title/description into its normalized form (ie. UX Developer =>\nSoftware Engineer).\n\nAverage salaries was determined by taking the average min + max of all job\npostings and taking the midpoint.\n\nByHenley Wing Chiu\n\nUpdated on April 13, 2024\n\n  * Labor Trends\n\n## Read Next\n\nByHenley Wing Chiu\n\nFebruary 16, 2024\n\n### The jobs being replaced by AI \u2013 an analysis of 5M freelancing jobs\n\nThere\u2019s no question that AI will impact jobs.
