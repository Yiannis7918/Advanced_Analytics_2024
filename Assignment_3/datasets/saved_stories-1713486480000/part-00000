On the datacenter CPU front, Intel is using the\nshow to unveil their newest branding for their venerable family of Xeon\nprocessors. Beginning with this year's sixth generation of processors, Intel\nis \"evolving\" the Xeon brand by retiring the \"Xeon Scalable\" branding in favor\nof Intel's new and simplified \"Xeon 6\" brand.\n\nThe Xeon 6 family is set to launch later this year with two primary variants:\nan all-performance (P) core chip codenamed Granite Rapids, and an all-\nefficiency (E) core chip codenamed Sierra Forest. Both of these chips will be\nsold under the Xeon 6 brand and sit on top of the same motherboard platform,\nwith the Xeon 6 branding intended in part to underscore this shared platform.\nThough speaking of the chips themselves, at this time Intel isn't illustrating\nhow the two sub-series of chips will be differentiated in terms of product\nnumbers.\n\nOver the last year, we've extensively covered Intel's Granite Rapids and\nSierra Forest. For more information about Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest,\nhere are some of our key pieces:\n\n  * Hot Chips 2023: Intel Details More on Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest Xeons\n  * Intel Previews Sierra Forest with 288 E-Cores, Announces Granite Rapids-D for 2025 Launch at MWC 2024\n  * IFS Reborn as Intel Foundry: Expanded Foundry Business Adds 14A Process To Roadmap\n\nIntel debuted their Xeon Scalable branding in 2017 with the launch of the Xeon\nPlatinum 8100 series, which was built using their Skylake microarchitecture.\nAt the time Xeon Scalable replaced Intel's older Xeon E/EP/EX vX branding,\nresetting the generation count in the process.\n\nMoving forward to 2024, Intel is looking to build an ecosystem befitting the\ncurrent demands of technologies within key areas such as data centers, Edge,\nand the PC. Intel is laying the foundations for what it calls 'Intel\nEnterprise AI.' Using a vast array of frameworks and accelerators and working\nclosely with partners, ISVs, and GSIs to create a large and open ecosystem,\nthe newly branded Intel Xeon 6 platforms will be key in the enterprise market\nas we advance.\n\nIntel has adopted a newer and simpler nomenclature for Granite Rapids and\nSierra Forest, starting with the Intel Xeon 6 processors. Sierra Forest Xeon 6\nprocessors are set to launch in Q2 of 2024, which include a chip featuring 288\nE-cores. It will be the first product to adopt this new branding, which is\ndesigned to ease customer navigation between models. Meanwhile the Xeon 6\nP-core Granite Rapids processors will come later.\n\nUltimately, the Xeon brand itself and what it entails (enterprise,\nworkstation, server, and data center) isn't going anywhere. Instead, Intel is\nputting an increased focus on the generation number of the platform by moving\nit front and center, to more clearly highlight what generation of technology a\npart belongs to.\n\nAs mentioned, Intel's Xeon 6 processors, based on their Sierra Forest\narchitecture, are set to launch in Q2 2024, while the Granite Rapids Xeon 6\nplatform is expected to come sometime in the second half of 2024.\n\nGallery: Intel Vision 2024 Press Deck\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n  * ### Post Your Comment\n\nPlease log in or sign up to comment.\n\nPOST A COMMENT\n\n## 6 Comments\n\n### View All Comments\n\n  * #### bubblyboo - Tuesday, April 9, 2024 - link\n\n\"It is set to launch in the future with two primary variants, including a\nPerformance (P) core family based on Intel's Sierra Forest architecture and an\nEfficiency (E) core-flavored variant based on Granite Rapids.\"\n\nYou swapped these Reply\n\n  * #### NextGen_Gamer - Tuesday, April 9, 2024 - link\n\nYup Reply\n\n  * #### trivik12 - Tuesday, April 9, 2024 - link\n\nDid Intel say anything about number of cores on Granite Rapids. Keeping it\nquite this late is bad news for sure. With Google launching ARM CPU, x86 is at\ncrossroads for sure. Reply\n\n  * #### m53 - Tuesday, April 9, 2024 - link\n\nARM is mainly a Sierra Forest competitor. Sierra Forest is launching soon.\nReply\n\n  * #### edzieba - Tuesday, April 9, 2024 - link\n\nHearkens back to the old Xeon 1234 vX generational nomenclature. Reply\n\n  * #### RU482 - Friday, April 12, 2024 - link\n\nam I correct in thinking that they are splitting Xeon Scalable into 4 swim\nlanes? 1. Sierra Forest-SP (all E-cores, LGA4710) 2. Granite Rapids-SP (all\nP-cores, LGA4710) 3. Sierra Forest-AP (all E-cores, LGA7529) 4. Granite\nRapids-AP (all P-cores, LGA7529) Reply\n\n## PIPELINE STORIES\n\n\\+ Submit News\n\nASML Patterns First Wafer Using High-NA EUV Tool, Ships Second High-NA Scanner\nIntel and Sandia National Labs Roll Out 1.15B Neuron \u201cHala Point\u201d Neuromorphic\nResearch System Samsung Unveils 10.7Gbps LPDDR5X Memory - The Fastest Yet\n\n  * Samsung To Receive $6.4 Billion Under CHIPS Act to Build $40 Billion Fab in Texas\n  * NVIDIA Intros RTX A1000 and A400: Entry-Level ProViz Cards Get Ray Tracing\n  * Corsair Enters Workstation Memory Market with WS Series XMP/EXPO DDR5 RDIMMs\n  * Western Digital Previews 4 TB SD Card: World's Highest-Capacity\n  * AMD Quietly Launches Ryzen 7 8700F and Ryzen 5 8400F Processors\n  * Intel Teases Lunar Lake At Intel Vision 2024: 100+ TOPS Overall, 45 TOPS From NPU Alone\n  * Intel To Discontinue Boxed 13th Gen Core CPUs for Enthusiasts\n  * Report: Impact of Taiwanese Earthquake on DRAM Output to be Negligible in Q2\n  * Google Develops In-House Arm 'Axion' CPU for Datacenters\n\n## LINKS\n\n  * Home\n  * About\n  * Forums\n  * RSS\n  * Pipeline News\n  * Bench\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Contact Us\n  * Accessibility Statement\n\n## TOPICS\n\n  * CPUs\n  * Motherboards\n  * SSD/HDD\n  * GPUs\n  * Mobile\n  * Enterprise & IT\n  * Smartphones\n  * Memory\n  * Cases/Cooling/PSU(s)\n\n  * Displays\n  * Mac\n  * Systems\n  * Cloud\n  * Trade Shows\n  * Guides\n\n## FOLLOW\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * RSS\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n  * About\n  * Advertising\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024.
