If \"there were\nno bodies available for consumption, lots were drawn to determine who would be\nsacrificed to provide food for the others\". As long as the lottery was fair,\ngiving everyone an equal risk of dying to become food for the others, this was\nconsidered \"entirely legal\" and justified by the circumstances. \"On the whole,\nsailors and the general public knew and accepted [this] protocol of\ncannibalism to survive ship disasters.\"^[3]\n\nThe historian A. W. Brian Simpson observed:\n\n> If properly conducted, cannibalism was legitimated by a custom of the sea;\n> and the popular literature, augmented by the unrecorded tales seamen told\n> each other, ensured that there was general understanding of what had to be\n> done on these occasions and that survivors who had followed the custom could\n> have a certain professional pride in a job well done; there was nothing to\n> hide.^[4]\n\nReferring to William Arens' widely-read book The Man-Eating Myth, he added\nthat, since \"maritime survival cannibalism, preceded by the drawing of lots\nand killing, was a socially accepted practice among seamen until the end of\nthe days of sail ... it is ... not an exception but a counterexample\" to\nArens' thesis \"that cannibalism, as a socially accepted practice, is a\nmyth\".^[5]\n\nThe only cases when cannibalism in maritime disasters sometimes led to legal\nprosecution was \"when the lotteries were fixed or absent altogether\", in\nviolation of the accepted custom.^[3] Such violations were nevertheless common\nenough. Captains and other crew members were often unwilling to put their own\nlives at risk, as the rules of the custom demanded, instead choosing to\nsacrifice those they considered \"more expendable ... (such as slaves, young\nboys, and passengers)\" to serve as food for the other survivors.^[6]\n\n## End of the cannibal custom[edit]\n\nMain article: R v Dudley and Stephens\n\nThe case of R v Dudley and Stephens (1884 14 QBD 273 DC) is an English case\nwhich developed a crucial ruling on necessity in modern common law, at the\nsame time ending the custom of lot drawing and cannibalism. Accused were two\ncrew members of an English yacht, the Mignonette, who in 1884 were shipwrecked\nin a storm some 1,600 miles from the Cape of Good Hope. After a few weeks\nadrift in a lifeboat, 17-year-old Richard Parker fell unconscious due to a\ncombination of hunger and drinking seawater. Two of the three others on the\nboat decided to kill and eat him (the third man abstained). They were picked\nup four days later. The case held that necessity was not a defense for a\ncharge of murder, and the two defendants were convicted, though their death\nsentence was commuted to six months' imprisonment.^[7]\n\nIn this case, the rules of the traditional custom had not been adhered to\nsince no lots had been drawn. However, the judges made it clear that they did\nnot consider necessity a possible justification for murder regardless of the\ncircumstances; they did not consider killing anyone acceptable, even if this\nwas the sole way to ensure the survival of the others, instead \"pompous[ly]\"\ndeclaring that the right course of action, under the circumstances, would have\nbeen for everybody to starve to death.^[8]\n\nAfter this judgment, there were no more cases of openly admitted cannibal\nkillings on board British or American ships. This does not necessarily mean\nthat they no longer occurred \u2014 but the sailors had certainly learned that more\ndiscretion was now required, since the custom had effectively been declared\nunlawful in the Mignonette case. In the 1890s, there were two more highly\nsuspect cases of maritime hunger cannibalism, but the survivors asserted that\nthe eaten had died a natural death. Nobody seemed strongly inclined to try to\nprove otherwise, and no juridical proceedings followed.^[9]\n\nIn other countries, the defense of necessity to prevent starvation in the case\nof shipwrecks proved somewhat more durable. In the 1890s, two such incidents\noccurred on Norwegian vessels. In one case, lots were drawn to select a\nvictim, while in the other case, two sailors were stabbed to death and eaten\nbecause the other sailors considered them close to death anyway. In both\ncases, the authorities investigated but decided not to press charges,\nconsidering the acts as justified by necessity.^[10]\n\n## Historical examples of lot drawing prior to survival cannibalism[edit]\n\n### Saint Christopher case[edit]\n\nSome time between 1629 and 1640, seven Englishmen in the Caribbean embarked on\nan overnight voyage from Saint Christopher Island, but were blown out to sea\nand lost for 17 days. During this time, starving, they cast lots to see who\nwould sacrifice his own life for the others. The lot fell to the man who had\nsuggested the scheme, and he consented to his subsequent killing. His body\nsustained the rest until they made their way to Saint Martin. They were\nreturned to Saint Christopher where they were put on trial for homicide. The\nlocal English judge supposedly pardoned them, declaring that the crime was\n\"'washed away' by 'inevitable necessity'\".^[11]\n\nThe case cannot be found in the island's legal records, which start only in\n1644, but was described, supposedly based on eyewitness accounts, by the Dutch\nsurgeon Nicolaes Tulp in his Observationes Medicae (1641). Simpson considers\nhis account as credible, noting that he likely received his information from\nthe Dutch authorities in Saint Martin which had decided to send the sailors\nback to Saint Christopher for trial.^[11]\n\n### Essex[edit]\n\nAfter a whale rammed and sank the whaling ship Essex of Nantucket on 20\nNovember 1820, the survivors were left floating in three small whaleboats.\nThey eventually resorted, by common consent, to cannibalism to allow some to\nsurvive.^[12] Of the seven crew members eaten, six died of starvation and\nexposure; one, Owen Coffin, lost a lottery, and was shot. The captain\nvolunteered to take Coffin's place but Coffin refused, instead accepting his\nlot stoically.^[13]\n\n### Doubtful cases[edit]\n\nIn the case of the Mary, which sank in 1736, and the Euxine, which shipwrecked\nin 1874, lots were ostensibly drawn to determine a victim for killing and\ncannibalism. However, in both cases there are doubts whether the lot drawing\nwas fair (and whether it even happened), since the lot fell, conveniently from\nthe viewpoint of the core crew, on an \"obvious victim\". In the case of the\nMary, a passenger was singled out; in the case of the Euxine, the deadly lot\nfell on an Italian \"boy\" of about 20 years, who was both a foreigner (speaking\nlittle English) and the youngest surviving crew member.^[14]\n\n## Cases where no fair lottery was held[edit]\n\nIn other cases it is known that somebody was killed for survival cannibalism\nwithout a fair lottery taking place. In such cases, the victim was almost\nalways a person of low status, such as a black slave or a teenage boy.^[6]\n\nIn the winter of 1765/66, the American ship Peggy drifted for months after a\nsevere storm had destroyed all its means of navigation. Having eaten all their\nprovisions, as well as any remaining \"tobacco, lamp oil, candles, and ...\nleather\", the crew told the captain they would hold a lottery to decide who\nshould be slaughtered to feed the others. But among themselves they had\nalready decided to kill the one black slave on board, and after a sham lottery\nthey \"shot him through the head. One of the crew ate the victim's raw liver;\nsome of the rest of the body was cooked, and the remainder was pickled.\"^[15]\n\nAt nearly the same time, in 1766, a vessel named Tiger was shipwrecked. After\nprovisions had run out, the sailors decided to kill the one \"negro youth\" on\nboard (probably a slave) rather than drawing lots, as one of them freely\nreported afterwards. The dead body was then smoked to last longer.^[16]\n\nThe Irish sailing barque Francis Spaight capsized and almost sunk in December\n1836, near the coast of Canada. All provisions were lost or spoiled. Four of\nthe fifteen survivors were teenage apprentices. Two weeks after the accident,\nthe captain decided that \"lots should be drawn between the four boys, as they\nhad no families, and could not be considered so great a loss to their friends,\nas those who had wives and children depending upon them.\" The boys protested\nagainst this unfair decision, but in vain. The lot fell on fourteen-year-old\nPatrick O'Brien, who was then killed by the ship's cook. During the next days,\nthe sailors survived by drinking his blood and eating his flesh.^[17]\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, a British resident magistrate met a captain\nnamed Anson whose crew \"had run short of provisions\" while \"bring[ing] a yacht\nfrom England to Australia\". Accordingly, they had killed and \"eaten the cabin\nboy\". No lot drawing is mentioned but they had somehow escaped legal\nconsequences, \"probably upon some plea of self-preservation\".^[18]\n\n## Fictional references in literature[edit]\n\nEdgar Allan Poe's only novel, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket\n(1838), has a minor character, Richard Parker, who is cannibalised by the\nshipwreck's survivors. In an eerie parallel to the actual case of the\nMignonette, which happened more than 50 years later, both cannibalised people\nshared the exact same name.\n\nIn 1866, W.S. Gilbert wrote a song, \"The Yarn of the Nancy Bell\", in which the\nlast survivor of shipwreck sings that he is the entire crew after drawing lots\nand eating his other shipmates.\n\nThe stories of Richard Parker (real and fictional) inspired the name of the\ntiger in Yann Martel's novel Life of Pi, in which cannibalism is discussed in\nrelation to a shipwreck.\n\nThe 2019 movie Harpoon, in which three friends are stranded aboard their yacht\nat sea, references both the incident aboard the Mignonette and the Edgar Allan\nPoe story. One of the characters is also named Richard Parker.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Oceans portal\n\n  * Barratry (admiralty law)\n  * Man overboard\n  * Mutiny\n  * The captain goes down with the ship\n  * Women and children first\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Walker, Andrew (2011).
