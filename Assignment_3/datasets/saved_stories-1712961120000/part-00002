A\nKyiv intelligence source said it struck a site used to produce Russian long-\nrange drones that have been used in the thousands to pound Ukraine during the\n25-month war.\n\nRussian media reported that two drones struck the dormitory at Russia's\nAlabuga Special Economic Zone, which is located more than 1,200 kilometers\nfrom Ukraine's northeastern city of Kharkiv near the Russian border. It is\nunclear what the second drone was.\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
