In a nutshell it allows apps to tell the compositor when to\ndisplay frames on the screen, reducing latency and graphical glitches. The\neffect should be particularly noticeable with NVIDIA GPUs, which only support\nthis rendering style, and not having support for it on Wayland was the most\ncommon source of random graphical glitches and slowdowns.\n\nThis work was done by Xaver Hugl, and lands in Plasma 6.1. You can read more\nabout it in a recent blog post he wrote on the topic!\n\nIn addition to that impactful but technical change, this was a week of many UI\nimprovements and bug fixes as well:\n\n## UI Improvements\n\nImproved the visual quality of cross-screen screenshots that Spectacle takes\nwhen using multi-screen setups where the screens have different scale factors\n(Noah Davis, Spectacle 24.05. Link)\n\nImproved quality of blurs, pixelations, and shadows in Spectacle\u2019s annotations\n(Noah Davis, Spectacle 24.05. Link)\n\nKWrite now shows a hamburger menu by default instead of a traditional menu\nbar, and the hamburger menu has gained an assortment of curated actions on the\ntop to speed up access to them (Nathan Garside and Christoph Cullmann, KWrite\n24.05. Link 1, link 2, and link 3):\n\nJust KWrite! Nothing has changed for Kate.\n\nFilelight now throws fewer annoying modal dialog windows in your face: it now\nshows directory access errors using inline placeholder messages, and failures\nto add duplicate exclusion paths using small toasts/passive notifications (Han\nYoung, Filelight 24.05. Link 1 and link 2)\n\nIn the \u201cGet New [Thing]\u201d dialogs, the warning shown at the top is now\ndifferent and more warningy if the available content has the potential to run\nexecutable code on your system (David Edmundson and me: Nate Graham, Plasma\n6.1 and Gear apps 24.05. Link 1 and link 2):\n\nIn Plasma\u2019s traditional Task Manager widget, the threshold for showing any\ntext is now smaller, so you\u2019ll see text more often even at relatively narrow\ntask widths. This is based on the idea that if you\u2019re using this widget, it\u2019s\nbecause you want to see text! (me: Nate Graham, Plasma 6.0.4. Link)\n\nOn Wayland, the Dialog Parent effect that dims parent windows when dialogs are\nactive now temporarily disables the dimming when the dialog window is a color\npicker that\u2019s currently picking a screen color (Ivan Tkachenko, Plasma 6.1.\nLink)\n\nSystem Settings\u2019 Virtual Desktops page has now adopted the common \u201ccontrols on\nthe header row\u201d paradigm to increase the apace available for content (Jakob\nPetsovits, Plasma 6.1. Link):\n\nIn Plasma\u2019s Power and Battery widget, the controls and UI for blocking sleep\nand screen locking have moved from the header into the view, matching the\nlocation of other interactive controls and preventing the header from becoming\nsuper chunky when multiple apps are inhibiting sleep and screen locking\n(Natalie Clarius, Plasma 6.1. Link):\n\nSystem Monitor now shows a tooltip with the full text when you hover over an\nelided piece of text in one of the table views (Joshua Goins, Plasma 6.1.\nLink)\n\nMade the header message on System Settings\u2019 File Search page frameless and\nborder-touching, making use of new API created to enable this purpose. This\nAPI was also used for the message in the \u201cGet new [thing]\u201d dialog shown\nearlier. So expect to see more of this kind of thing in the coming weeks! (me:\nNate Graham, Plasma 6.1. Link 1 and link 2):\n\nFolder popups invoked from a Plasma panel can now be resized if you\u2019d like\nmore space to see everything in them (Ivan Tkachenko, Plasma 6.1. Link)\n\nIf you preferred the old style of app launching in Plasma\u2019s traditional Task\nManager widget whereby an app\u2019s pinned launcher would disappear when launched,\nyou can now get that back (Niccol\u00f2 Venerandi, Plasma 6.1. Link)\n\nMiddle-clicking a desktop in KWin\u2019s Overview effect no longer instantly\nremoves it, because this made it too easy to accidentally destroy your layout\n(me: Nate Graham, Plasma 6.1. Link)\n\nThe radius of rounded corners throughout Breeze-themed UI elements has now\nbeen standardized at 5px, much better than the previous random assortment of\ncorner radii that ranged generally from 2-5px, with some being as high as 8 or\n16px! This is an easily bikeshedded topic, so please try to restrain\nyourselves; check out all the other screenshots in this post, which feature\nthe change\u2014I bet you thought they looked pretty good before I explicitly\nmentioned that the corner radius had increased, right!? (Akseli Lahtinen,\nPlasma 6.1 and Frameworks 6.2. Link)\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\nIn Dolphin\u2019s Details view, navigating to a subdirectory no longer resets the\ncurrent sort mode (Felix Ernst, Dolphin 24.02.2. Link)\n\nGwenview no longer inappropriately blocks sleep and screen locking when simply\nviewing an image (Daniel Strnad, Gwenview 24.02.2. Link)\n\nFixed a nasty bug in Spectacle that could cause the rectangular region overlay\nto get stuck on screen when taking a rectangular region screenshot right after\na screen recording without quitting and re-launching Spectacle first (Noah\nDavis, Spectacle 24.05. Link)\n\nPlasma\u2019s Night Light feature no longer unintentionally connects to Mozilla\nLocation Services to geolocate you for the purpose of figuring out the Night\nLight transition time when you don\u2019t have that setting turned on (Natalie\nClarius, Plasma 5.27.12. Link)\n\nPlasma no longer crashes when you close the notification that gives you an\nopportunity to undo removing an Icon widget (Nicolas Fella, Plasma 6.0.4.\nLink)\n\nModal font dialogs in Plasma 6 are now ugly, but at least they work again; our\nprevious styling approach caused them to end up non-interactive and has been\nreverted for now pending a better solution (Nicolas Fella, Plasma 6.0.4. Link)\n\nDiscover once again shows you everything you have installed on its \u201cInstalled\u201d\npage\u2014not just an assortment of packages that depended on what distro you were\nusing (Harald Sitter, Plasma 6.0.4. Link)\n\nWhen scrolling down in one app category on Kickoff and then switching\ncategories, random items from the former category no longer sometimes appear\ninappropriately on the new page (David Redondo, Plasma 6.0.4. Link)\n\nOn Wayland, the color picker dialog no longer returns incorrect colors when an\nICC profile is applied to the display (Xaver Hugl, Plasma 6.0.4. Link)\n\nFixed a strange issue whereby items in Plasma\u2019s list view mode Folder View\npopups on a panel could only be highlighted when moving the cursor downwards,\nrather than upwards (Akseli Lahtinen, Plasma 6.0.4. Link)\n\nFixed a bug that made it possible, under certain circumstances, to drag a\nwindow completely off the screen (Yifan Zhu, Plasma 6.0.4. Link)\n\nOn Wayland, the clipboard menu that appears when you hit Meta+V no longer goes\nunderneath windows set to always be on top (Tino Lorenz, Plasma 6.0.4. Link)\n\nIn KWin\u2019s Overview effect, the thumbnails for inactive virtual desktops are\nnow live, not static (David Redondo, Plasma 6.0.4. Link)\n\nFixed a problem creating new Wireguard VPNs (Stephen Robinson, Plasma 6.1.\nLink)\n\nKeyboards are no longer sometimes shown as mice on System Settings\u2019 Mouse page\n(me: Nate Graham, Plasma 6.1. Link)\n\nRapidly toggling the \u201cFloating\u201d setting for a Plasma panel on and off no\nlonger sometimes causes the panel to get stuck in a position where it\u2019s not\nfloating, but also detached from the screen edge (Vlad Zahorodnii, Plasma 6.1.\nLink)\n\nDiscover no longer mislabels apps that get removed from a Flatpak repo as\nbeing not installed when they are in fact still installed (Aleix Pol and Ivan\nTkachenko, Plasma 6.1. Link)\n\nFixed a case where KDE apps could run out of memory when told to open certain\ntypes of malformed image files (Mirco Miranda, Frameworks 6.1. Link)\n\nFixed the most common crash in the Baloo file indexing service, with 113\nduplicates as of the time of writing (Christoph Cullmann, Frameworks 6.2.\nLink)\n\nFixed a rare case where KIO could exhaust all memory while trying and failing\nto process HTTP requests under certain unusual circumstances (Harald Sitter,\nFrameworks 6.2. Link)\n\nWebDAV files accessed through Dolphin or other KDE apps once again show the\ncorrect modification times (Fabian Vogt, Frameworks 6.2. Link)\n\nOther bug information of note:\n\n  * 3 Very high priority Plasma bugs (up from 2 last week). Current list of bugs\n  * 36 15-minute Plasma bugs (up from 34 last week). Current list of bugs\n  * Again 145 KDE bugs of all kinds fixed over the last week! Full list of bugs\n\n## Performance & Technical\n\nAfter Qt changes regressed this, changing color schemes is once again nearly\ninstant, giving the \u201cblend changes\u201d KWin effect enough time to provide a\nsmooth transition between the colors (Kai Uwe Broulik, Frameworks 6.2 Link)\n\nFiles and folders on the desktop that are copied or dragged are now made\navailable via the Portals system, so dropping them into sandboxed apps now\nworks as expected (Karol Kosek, Plasma 6.0.4. Link)\n\n## ...And Everything Else\n\nThis blog only covers the tip of the iceberg! If you\u2019re hungry for more, check\nout https://planet.kde.org, where you can find more news from other KDE\ncontributors.\n\n## How You Can Help\n\nKDE has become important in the world, and your time and labor have helped to\nbring it there! But as we grow, it\u2019s going to be equally important that this\nstream of labor be made sustainable, which primarily means paying for it.\nRight now the vast majority of KDE runs on labor not paid for by KDE e.V. (the\nnonprofit foundation behind KDE, which I am a board member for), and that\u2019s a\nproblem. We\u2019ve taken steps to change this with paid technical contractors\u2014but\nthose steps are small due to limited financial resources. If you\u2019d like to\nhelp change that, consider donating today!\n\nOtherwise, visit https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved to discover other ways\nto be part of a project that really matters. Each contributor makes a huge\ndifference in KDE; you are not a number or a cog in a machine! You don\u2019t have\nto already be a programmer, either. I wasn\u2019t when I got started. Try it,\nyou\u2019ll like it! We don\u2019t bite!\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nThis week in KDE: Primarily Centered HamburgersNovember 12, 2021In \"This Week\nin KDE\"\n\nThis week in KDE: window thumbnails on WaylandAugust 7, 2020In \"This Week in\nKDE\"\n\nThis week in KDE: Distro upgrades for Fedora KDE in DiscoverMarch 25, 2023In\n\"Automation & Systematization\"\n\n## Published by Nate\n\nView all posts by Nate\n\nPublished April 12, 2024April 12, 2024\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nJoin 927 other subscribers\n\n# Follow via RSS\n\n  * RSS - Posts\n\n# Tip jar\n\nLiberaPay:\n\nPayPal:\n\n# Popular posts\n\n  * This week in KDE: Explicit Sync\n\n  * This week in KDE: real modifier-only shortcuts and cropping in Spectacle\n\n  * This week in KDE: looking forward towards Plasma 6.1\n\n  * So let's talk about this Wayland thing\n\n  * Tips & tricks: handwritten signatures in Okular\n\n# Categories\n\n  * Automation & Systematization\n  * Call to Action\n  * Discover\n  * FOSS culture\n  * Fundraising\n  * High DPI\n  * Inside KDE\n  * Linux Hardware\n  * New Contributor Friendliness\n  * Planning\n  * Plasma Mobile\n  * Presentations & Interviews\n  * The KDE Community\n  * This Week in KDE\n  * Tips & Tricks\n  * Uncategorized\n  * Usability & Productivity\n  * User Interface Design\n  * World Domination\n\n# Archives\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * Adventures in Linux and KDE\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
