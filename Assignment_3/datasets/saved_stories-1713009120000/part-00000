And yet, after millennia of human\nhabitation, Athenian history isn\u2019t confined to a few famous spots. Over the\nlast two centuries, as the city has grown from a sleepy village to a sprawling\ncapital, new ruins have been continually discovered. Greek national law\nrequires so-called rescue excavations before the construction of new houses,\nbuildings, subway lines, sewer systems, or almost anything else; although\nthese are faster and less comprehensive than the research excavations\nconducted for purely archeological reasons, they can still reveal the\nlocations of shrines, wells, walls, roads, and cemeteries, as well as smaller\nartifacts, such as oil lamps, toys, and loom weights. Collectively, all of\nthis material constitutes a kind of secret history of the city.\n\n### Daily\n\nOur flagship newsletter highlights the best of The New Yorker, including top\nstories, fiction, humor, and podcasts.\n\nUntil recently, information from rescue excavations was sequestered in a vast\ngray literature of reports published in Greek by the state archeological\nservice. But, in 2014, a group of Greek archeologists and a cartographer\nlaunched an organization called the Dipylon Society, which aims to share these\ndiscoveries more widely. Dipylon has undertaken a series of fascinating, high-\ntech projects, including digital maps, searchable databases, and free mobile\napps with guided walking tours. Its first app, Walk the Wall Athens, appeared\nin 2018. It leads users through a twisting six-kilometre course, past thirty-\nfive locations where parts of the ancient city\u2019s walls survive. The route\nsnakes through the basements of hotels and apartment buildings, beneath shops\nand through parking garages, connecting points where the twenty-five-hundred-\nyear-old monumental walls are still accessible. At these hidden spots, the app\nallows you to see historical photos, read key findings from the rescue\nexcavations, and hear an audio narration in Greek or English.\n\nDipylon\u2019s projects reflect years spent gathering, digitizing, and synthesizing\ndata from almost fifteen hundred rescue excavations conducted in Athens over\nthe past hundred and sixty years; it has changed our understanding of the\narcheology of the city. But, by recovering one sort of lost history, Dipylon\nhas revealed another. During Athens\u2019s most explosive decades of growth, the\narcheologists who ran excavations for the state archeological service were\npredominantly female; their work was often unheralded and unacknowledged. Now,\nin digital form, it\u2019s coming to light.\n\nOn a sunny morning last fall, I joined a wall walk led by Annita Theocharaki,\na founding member of Dipylon. A tall, curly-haired woman in her early sixties,\nTheocharaki runs a family business by day; Dipylon, which now has a full-time\nstaff of six, is a lasting passion project that she helps run on nights and\nweekends. We met at Kotzia Square, a pedestrian plaza fringed with leafy trees\nand charming neoclassical buildings. A dozen students had gathered outside a\ngated enclosure, inside which stone embankments lined a stretch of old road\nthat was barely the width of a bike path. \u201cImagine a road continuing directly\nbeneath us toward the walls,\u201d she said, sweeping her arms in a diagonal from\nwhere we stood to the edge of Kotzia Square. The students shifted their gaze\nto follow her hands.\n\n\u201cYou can see the burials on either side of the road,\u201d she continued, gesturing\nto bits of pale stone beside the path\u2014actually parts of weathered burial\nshafts and stone sarcophagi from a cemetery dating back to the eighth century\nB.C. \u201cIt\u2019s common to find cemeteries just outside the city walls, but placing\ngraves right beside the road was also about display,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone\nwalking in or out of the city would see all of the funerary monuments.\u201d As she\nspoke, the sun moved across the site, bathing the pale stone and red dirt in\nearly morning light.\n\nWe followed Theocharaki across the square, tracing the path of the old road\nthat ran invisibly beneath us. At the corner, tucked underneath the looming\nfa\u00e7ade of the National Bank of Greece, an open-air site plunged some twenty\nfeet below the modern city; inside this pit was a huge section of the ancient\nwall from the fourth century B.C. More of the wall was visible under glass\npanels in the sidewalk. Although it is now far below the level of the modern\ncity, it was likely around ten metres high in the fourth century B.C. and\nstill stands to half that height. \u201cFortification was just as important as the\nacropolis or the agora,\u201d Theocharaki said as we looked down. \u201cIt was not only\na matter of protection\u2014the walls were also beautiful, monumental structures.\nSomething citizens could admire.\u201d\n\nFrom there, our path grew stranger. In the underground parking lot of a bank,\na massive section of wall rose beside us in the shadows as we walked down a\nsloping concrete ramp. (According to one of Plato\u2019s dialogues, Socrates once\nwalked past this spot on an ancient ring road.) A few blocks away, we\ndescended into a subterranean warren of busy printers\u2019 shops. Theocharaki told\nsome workmen that we wanted to see the wall, and one began to clear aside\npiles of posters and paint-splattered buckets cluttering the corridor. Once he\nfinished, we peered through a steel grate and saw the pale chiselled blocks\nwinding away into the darkness. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s here,\u201d a student said.\n\nDipylon originated in the early two-thousands, when Theocharaki met another\narcheologist, Leda Costaki, in the stacks of a research library in Athens.\nBoth women had recently finished their dissertations: Theocharaki\u2019s on\nAthens\u2019s ancient walls, Costaki\u2019s on the city\u2019s ancient roads. \u201cDipylon\u201d was\nthe name of the main gate in classical Athens\u2014a place where walls and roads\nmeet. They thought that they\u2019d combine their interests by creating a map of\nthe roads and walls of the city. But they gradually began to imagine something\nmore ambitious: gathering information from rescue excavations in one place. As\nthey set to work, the true scope of the project soon became clear. Not only\ndid they have to analyze and digitize a huge amount of material; they also\nwanted attractive digital interfaces, a complex database structure, and free\nmobile apps. They organized the Dipylon Society as a nonprofit to help secure\ngrant funding and support a small full-time staff of designers, coders,\narcheologists, and a philologist.\n\nBy pulling together the rescue-excavation data, Dipylon was also exploring the\nsocial history of archeology in Greece. In the first half of the twentieth\ncentury, archeologists often prized artifacts more for their aesthetic\nqualities than for the social and historical information they might supply;\neven human skeletal remains were sometimes disregarded. Certain periods were\nvalued more than others: in some early excavation reports, state archeologists\ncalled the classical period \u201cthe beautiful years\u201d while the Roman era was\nconsidered of lesser worth. The Byzantine and Ottoman periods\u2014during which\nGreece was part of the Eastern Roman and Ottoman Empires\u2014lacked the cultural\ncachet of classical Athens and were often ignored. The emphasis was on\nmonumental architecture, or on painted pottery, jewelry, or sculpture that\nmight be displayed in a museum\u2014not on roads, walls, and simple objects of\ndaily use.\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nSuch objects were still unearthed, however, often by female archeologists, who\nwere less likely to have the option of an academic career. In the nineties,\njobs in Greece\u2019s state archeological service were often offered on a contract\nbasis, and women tended to fill these nonpermanent positions, which came\nwithout benefits. Understaffed, poorly compensated, and facing ferocious\npressure from landowners eager to start building, state archeologists usually\nwent unrecognized, their reports often signed only by their supervisors.\n\nIn the courtyard caf\u00e9 of the Numismatic Museum of Athens\u2014a beautiful three-\nstory neoclassical mansion that was once the residence of Heinrich Schliemann,\na German businessman and amateur archeologist\u2014I had coffee with Olga\nVoyatzoglou, who worked on rescue excavations for the state service in Athens\nin the nineteen-seventies and again in the nineties. Now in her seventies,\nVoyatzoglou is a petite woman with a soft voice and quick smile. As she told\nme about her years in the archeological service, it became clear that she and\nSchliemann were opposites in many ways. Schliemann, who excavated at Troy and\nMycenae, was internationally famous and bankrolled by a vast private fortune;\nhe was more treasure hunter than archeologist. Voyatzoglou was relatively\nobscure, interested in systematic research, and supported by meagre public\nfunds.\n\nIn the seventies, Voyatzoglou said, she supervised rescue excavations near the\nsite of Plato\u2019s Academy. Athens was in the midst of a construction boom, and\nlandowners had to pay the costs of labor for the teams of excavators that she\nsupervised. \u201cThis was a very big problem,\u201d she recalled with a sigh. \u201cBecause\nthe owner is paying, they don\u2019t want to lose money, so they are always saying,\nGo faster.\u201d Some landowners would begin construction illegally, digging the\nfoundations of buildings themselves and destroying the archeology; others\npressured her team to excavate only to a certain depth, fearing that they\nmight find something. On a typical day, she was directing workers at three to\nfour sites simultaneously while trying to protect and document the material\nbeing unearthed. She worked six days a week, with only Sundays off. When\nartifacts were discovered that might attract looters\u2014such as a burial with\nexpensive grave goods\u2014police were posted to guard the sites overnight.\n\n\u201cSomebody else could go and have a coffee,\u201d she said. \u201cNot me\u2014I was always\nthere.\u201d Still, despite the difficulties, she loved the work. \u201cEvery day you go\nin expecting to find something new.\u201d She oversaw excavations at well over a\nhundred sites during her time in the service\u2014and yet only a small fraction of\nthe material recovered is likely to appear in a museum. The rest languishes in\nlong-term storage, its significance buried in excavation reports that, before\nDipylon, were accessible only to specialists.\n\nIn 2021, Dipylon launched a project called Mapping Ancient Athens. An\ninteractive tool, it layers data from the Neolithic through the modern period\non a searchable map. You can explore houses in the Byzantine period, religious\nand cult locations in the Roman period, or water systems in the Ottoman\nperiod, browsing relevant information from the original rescue excavations.\nClick on the location of the Greek parliament building downtown, and you learn\nthat, in the Hellenistic period (323-31 B.C.), the site was likely a fullery\u2014a\nplace where sheep\u2019s wool was processed and dyed red and blue. Nearby, under a\npopular vegan restaurant, a three-aisled Byzantine church is buried, with a\ngray marble floor dating to the tenth century A.D.\n\nMuseums are usually discrete sites within a city. But Mapping Ancient Athens\nturns the whole city into a kind of exploded museum, with every shop and\ncorner harboring relics from a vanished world. This city-as-museum model\nhighlights the precise, often forgotten work of archeologists like\nVoyatzoglou.\n\nDipylon\u2019s newest project is a guided walking tour through some of the\nneighborhoods where Voyatzoglou once worked. Launched in May, the free Walk to\nPlato\u2019s Academy app starts on a busy street near the original Dipylon gate and\ntraces the route of an ancient road, which winds through the modern city to\nthe site of the Academy, today a sprawling park. Before the launch, I joined a\nsmall team for a test-walk. The first person to arrive was Pavlos Habidis, a\nwell-known Greek artist. In consultation with Dipylon\u2019s archeologists, Habidis\nhad painted a series of watercolors imagining historical landscapes and\nbuildings, and Dipylon had incorporated them into the app. Theocharaki and\nCostaki soon arrived, along with Maria Karagiannopoulou, an archeologist, and\nSpyros Mousouris, a Web developer.\n\nWhen we reached the first of fifteen points along the walk, we stopped beside\na noisy intersection. Holding up our phones, we began slowly turning in\ncircles. On our screens, a panoramic watercolor by Habidis rotated three\nhundred and sixty degrees. The painting let us gaze into the area as it might\nhave looked in the nineteenth century. There was a green meadow, a cluster of\norangish clay buildings, and a pale road leading to a grove of trees. Inky\nhills faded into a distant blue sky. For a moment, the roar of motorcycles and\nthe concrete, graffiti-covered buildings seemed to fade away.\n\n\u201cYou know, that\u2019s not bad!\u201d Habidis said, looking up and smiling. It was the\nfirst time he\u2019d seen his artwork digitized inside the app.\n\nWe walked a few blocks to the next stop. Across the street, a construction\ncrew was working with a bulldozer behind a blue steel fence. The archeologists\nall began speaking at once: What was being built? Had they gotten the proper\nauthorization? It is believed that the area used to have a sanctuary dedicated\nto the goddess Artemis, and earlier excavations had uncovered an inscribed\nstone recording a fourth-century-B.C. mortgage on a house and a tavern. If\nsomething new was being built, this required a new rescue excavation.\n\nWe crossed the street to take a closer look. A tall man in work boots and a\npuffy green jacket walked over.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re archeologists,\u201d Karagiannopoulou said. \u201cNot from the service, but we\u2019re\nmaking this app based on rescue archeology.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, looking slightly confused.\n\n\u201cWhen were there excavations here?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cSeptember of 2022,\u201d he said. \u201cThe owner didn\u2019t want a basement; they didn\u2019t\ngo very deep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will the new building be?\u201d Karagiannopoulou asked.\n\n\u201cA restaurant,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere was a tavern here in antiquity!\u201d she said, before explaining more about\nDipylon.\n\nHe nodded, still seeming unsure why a group of archeologists was so interested\nin the site.\n\n\u201cWe have to check the new excavation reports,\u201d Costaki said as we left.\n\nWe passed modern apartment blocks with laundry fluttering from their\nbalconies, butcher shops and trendy caf\u00e9s, and crumbling neoclassical\nbuildings from the nineteenth century, many abandoned and covered in scrawls\nof graffiti. Though close to downtown, we didn\u2019t see a single tourist. \u201cPeople\nwere telling us, Oh, you can\u2019t take tourists to that part of Athens,\u201d Costaki\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s run-down. It\u2019s dirty.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut that\u2019s life. I mean,\nthat\u2019s Athens. It\u2019s not only the Acropolis and the glorious monuments.\u201d\n\nIn the shadow of a looming highway overpass, as the roar of engines and the\nstench of exhaust drifted down, we gazed at Habidis\u2019s mellow rendering of a\nnineteenth-century olive mill which had once stood there. For most of the past\ntwo and half millennia, modern buildings hadn\u2019t obstructed the view; the\nAcropolis would have been visible from every point on the walk. Turning my\nphone, I saw a small Parthenon atop a white-and-mauve rock in Habidis\u2019s\npainting. By sliding a finger across the screen, it was possible to choose\nbetween contemporary and historical views. There was an intermediate zone\nwhere the two blurred into palimpsest, the rich specificity of the past\nhovering, faintly visible, beneath the modern street. By the end of the walk,\nthis visual effect had become a state of consciousness. Beneath the seductive\nsurface of the present, there is always something older\u2014the cool of a vanished\nstream, the clay of a potter\u2019s workshop, the stones of a country villa, the\ngrave of a young man buried with a flute and a lyre. Even archeology itself\nhas a past, which can flicker back to life. \u2666\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * Why facts don\u2019t change our minds.\n\n  * The tricks rich people use to avoid taxes.\n\n  * The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.\n\n  * How did polyamory get so popular?\n\n  * The ghostwriter who regrets working for Donald Trump.\n\n  * Snoozers are, in fact, losers.\n\n  * Fiction by Jamaica Kincaid: \u201cGirl\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nNick Romeo teaches in the Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley and is\nthe author of \u201cThe Alternative: How to Build a Just Economy.\u201d\n\nMore:ArcheologyAthensAncient GreeceHistoryExcavationsArcheologistsGreece\n\n### Daily\n\nOur flagship newsletter highlights the best of The New Yorker, including top\nstories, fiction, humor, and podcasts.\n\nRead More\n\nAnnals of Design\n\nA Dutch Architect\u2019s Vision of Cities That Float on Water\n\nWhat if building on the water could be safer and sturdier than building on\nflood-prone land?\n\nBy Kyle Chayka\n\nOur Local Correspondents\n\nCanoeing in a Superfund Site\n\nPaddling in the Gowanus Canal, in Brooklyn, has inspired one recovering lawyer\nto write poetry about toxic sludge, floating condoms, and gentrification.\n\nBy Eric Lach\n\nLetter from Montgomery\n\nBryan Stevenson Reclaims the Monument, in the Heart of the Deep South\n\nThe civil-rights attorney has created a museum, a memorial, and, now, a\nsculpture park, indicting the city of Montgomery\u2014a former capital of the\ndomestic slave trade and the cradle of the Confederacy.\n\nBy Doreen St. F\u00e9lix\n\nLetter from Roraima\n\nThe Brazilian Special-Forces Unit Fighting to Save the Amazon\n\nAs miners ravage Yanomami lands, combat-trained environmentalists work to root\nthem out.\n\nBy Jon Lee Anderson\n\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
