For example, the AI\ncompany Palantir, which is now public, has had contracts with the CIA, the\nNSA, the FBI, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, and the Special Operations\nCommand as well as the Israeli Defense Forces. In 2020, the U.S. military\nawarded $800 million to the company, and more than half of its revenue comes\nfrom the U.S. government, the paper said.\n\nOther defense tech contractors, which are still pre-IPO, include Anduril\nIndustries, Shield AI, HawkEye 360, Skydio, Rebellion Defense, and Epiru.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## By the numbers\n\n$53 billion: Combined value of contract ceilings between U.S. military and\nintelligence agencies and major tech firms between 2019 and 2022\n\nAdvertisement\n\n$28 billion: How much the Pentagon and the U.S. intelligence community awarded\nMicrosoft, Amazon, and Google from 2018 to 2022, which Gonz\u00e1lez says is likely\na conservative estimate\n\n$100 billion: How much venture capital funding went to defense tech startups\nfrom 2021 to 2023\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Agency of interest: U.S. Office of Strategic Capital\n\nIn December 2022 the Defense Department launched the Office of Strategic\nCapital, an entity set up to link AI and other startups with sources of\nprivate capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOSC aims to use the United States\u2019 comparative advantages in capital markets\nand economic competition to crowd in capital for the critical technology\nsupply chains needed by the Department of Defense,\u201d says its website.\n\n## \ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief\n\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every\nweekday morning.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
