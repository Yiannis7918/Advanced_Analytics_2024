Unplayable.\n\nReply\n\namerond3 years ago\n\nGlad to hear you enjoyed my game! Please check out some of my other games if\nyou get the chance\n\nReply\n\narhiDavid4 years ago(+1)\n\nI rate this game 98 lives out of 99.\n\namerond is a cheeky bugger, I'll give him that :)\n\nReply\n\ncamsgamesucks4 years ago(+1)\n\njust wanted to say this game is dumb and doesn't have a crouch button. I'm\nsure the creator thought he was being clever by putting some stupid mechanic\nin the game that I needed to engage my mind to figure out. However this game\nis neither interesting or engaging enough to make me try and figure it out.\nAlso the dialogue is terrible and the girlfriend looks like a dude, which is\nfine i guess considering it is 2019 but it is still losing points for me.\n\nReply\n\namerond4 years ago\n\nHey there friend, thanks for playing my game! I hope you found this game\ninteresting. Feel free to check out some of my other stuff too.\n\nReply\n\nitch.io\u00b7View all by amerond\u00b7Report\u00b7Embed\n\nGames \u203a Platformer \u203a Free\n\n", "frontpage": false}
