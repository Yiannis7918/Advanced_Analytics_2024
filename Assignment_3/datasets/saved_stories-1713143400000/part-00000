Thx Google\n\n# Personal VPN services are snake-oil\n\nPublished on 01 Mar 2024\n\n# Intro\n\nPersonal VPN services are a multi-million dollar business. But is it worth\nyour money?\n\nIf they can afford to sponsor Pewdiepie, they should do something right,\nright? Fifty million flies can\u2019t be wrong!\n\nThis is going to be a complex topic, so bear with me.\n\nThe statement I would like to prove: There are only a few problems for a few\npeople worldwide where the answer is using a personal VPN service. You don\u2019t\nneed a personal VPN service if you are an average Internet user. If you are a\ntech-savvy user, you can do much better than using a VPN. Personal VPNs are\nthe homeopathic medicines of the tech industry. Also known as a scam.\n\n# Glossary\n\nBy personal/commercial VPN service, I mean NordVPN, Tunnelbear, Mullvad VPN,\netc. Company VPNs, or a VPN to phone into your home network, are out of the\nscope of this article. By public Wi-Fi, I mean Wi-Fi services where it is\neither open or the WPA key is shared with everyone. From a security point of\nview, there is not much difference between the two.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the problem of privacy and security. Let\u2019s start with ...\n\n# Security\n\nFifteen years ago, it was common malpractice that even though websites used\nHTTPS for the login page, the rest of the communication was over HTTP. One\ncould steal the authentication cookie from the unencrypted Wi-Fi stream and\nuse that to log in to that service. Tools like Surfjack and Firesheep were\npopular tools for wannabe hackers. Back then, using a personal VPN service at\npublic Wi-Fi made sense. Also, many email clients checked their email using\nunencrypted POP3 or IMAP protocols.\n\nBut nowadays, there is practically no vital service on the Internet, which\ndoes not run on HTTPS.\n\nOK, but what about tools like SSLStrip? SSLStrip works like this:\n\n  1. User types www.mybanklogin.com\n  2. The browser connects to clear-text, unprotected http://www.mybanklogin.com\n  3. Attacker having active man-in-the-middle (MiTM) capability sees this traffic\n  4. The web server notifies the user\u2019s browser that it should use the secure https://www.mybanklogin.com site\n  5. The attacker removes this notification\n  6. The user continues the login process over the insecure, unencrypted http://www.mybanklogin.com\n\nSo, can hackers steal my username and password? First, for accounts that\nmatter, you should use 2FA (short for multi-factor authentication). It would\nbe best to use unphisable 2FA like FIDO2/webauthn (e.g. Yubikey) for accounts\nthat matter. Nowadays, most browsers implement \u201cHTTPS only mode\u201d. Next time,\ninstead of turning on your VPN, you should check if your browser already uses\nHTTPS only mode, and if not, turn that on. For example, Safari does that by\ndefault. Ask your service provider to implement HSTS. It is excellent about\nHSTS that the user cannot bypass certificate errors. And the browser will\nauto-connect to HTTPS by default. The good news is that if you use mobile\napps, almost all are secure already. Just keep your mobile OS and apps up-to-\ndate. No one will spoil a precious 0-day to attack you. If you are worried\nabout DNS MiTM, use DNS over HTTP in your browser. OK, but what about tools\nlike Metasploit browser autopwn? Well, the good news is that it is much easier\nto keep your browser up-to-date compared to ~ ten years ago. Nowadays,\nhowever, it is rare that recent browser exploits are openly available for any\nhacker to use. If you are a target of a government, spy agency, or hacker-for-\nhire services, yes, they may have the resources to hack your browser, but\nchances are you are not that important. Sorry. And if you are that important,\nVPNs will not decrease your risks.\n\nOne massive problem with personal VPN services is that they are working to\nfail open. If the connection fails, your connection is not \u201cprotected\u201d\nanymore. Some premium VPN providers sell \u201ckill switch\u201d functionality, but I am\nsure less than 1% of the users use this properly.\n\nLooking at the practical side, how many legit stories do you know where\nsomeone lost money that could have been avoided just by using a VPN? I have\nnever heard such a story. The \u201c Darkhotel \u201c attacker group could have been\nsuch an example, except that a VPN would not protect you against their attack,\nas they used fake Wi-Fi captive portals to deliver the exploit/malware. And\nbefore logging into a hotel Wi-Fi portal, you can\u2019t start your VPN ...\n\nAnd before I forget, let\u2019s quickly discuss free VPNs. Never, ever install a\nfree VPN solution. They will abuse your network connectivity, and other\nmalicious or non-malicious users will use it to do whatever they want. It is\nlike inviting one thousand unknown people to your house to have a party and\nleave them unattended. You can find many stories where free VPNs are actually\nmalware.\n\n# Privacy concerns\n\nOK, but what about my DNS and TLS records being exposed to everyone so they\ncan follow what I am doing? In a public place, anyone can look at your display\nalready. Or, if you are worried about your ISP selling your traffic data,\nthere are better options for you. Use DNS over HTTPS, for example. You have to\nuse a VPN provider you trust better than your ISP/Wi-Fi provider. Also, as\nEncrypted Client Hello is about to start soon, it will be exponentially harder\nfor eavesdroppers to figure out which sites you are trying to visit.\n\nBut if you care about privacy, the answer is always ToR, ToR browser or Tails,\nand never VPN. Except in cases where you first have to hide your ToR usage\nusing a VPN, which is a rare exception among users. If you don\u2019t understand\nwhy you would need that, you probably don\u2019t need that complexity. Tor Browser\nuses uncountable techniques that prevent tracking your browser. And if your\nprivacy is essential against local Wi-Fi attackers, your ISP, why is the ad\nindustry not in scope? Adblockers are only half the solution against tracking.\n\n# When to use a personal VPN?\n\n  1. Geofence bypass for region-locked content.\n  2. Piracy. Not that you should not support your artists/musicians/content creators, filmmakers, actors, ... but I agree that there are situations in life when piracy is the only ethical option.\n  3. Soft network block/censorship. Do your own research. Don\u2019t end up in jail.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nClaims made by VPN companies:\n\n  1. VPNs reduce the risk of \u201cgetting hacked,\u201d whatever that means. This is not true. Additional services provided by VPNs, like URL filtering, can reduce your risk. However, it is more effective to use URL filtering on the endpoint level, not the network level, as most VPN companies do.\n\n  2. VPNs protect your privacy Even though they increase your privacy, it is still far from what ToR can do for you.\n\nSuppose you want to increase your privacy and security. Instead of watching\nVPN reviews on YouTube, I recommend that you patch your operating system and\nyour browser and configure always HTTPS and DoH in your browser. Use an ad\nblocker or, even better, a browser built with privacy in mind. If you\nfrequently install new applications, use antivirus/endpoint protection on your\nnon-mobile OS. For Windows, the built-in default Microsoft Defender is a good\noption. Congratulations, you are in a better position compared to using a VPN,\nand you don\u2019t have to pay for it, and you don\u2019t have to enable it all the\ntime.\n\n# What to read?\n\nI found these articles also useful. As this is a complex topic, with different\naspects, if you want to read more, this is where I recommend to start:\noverengineer.dev krebsonsecurity.com gist.github.com/joepie91\nwww.spacebar.news www.forbes.com it.slashdot.org\n\n# PS\n\nYes, some of these VPN products provide extra services/functions/protections.\nAnd some of these extras make sense. But that does not mean that VPN is the\nanswer to your problems overall.\n\n# PS 2\n\nWPA3 can support encryption and privacy on open, non-password-protected\nnetworks. I have not seen it anywhere in the wild, but the future is bright.\nIf you operate open Wi-Fi networks, please, please, upgrade to WPA3.\n\n## related posts\n\n  * ### \"Just\" migrate to Jekyll ...\n\n  * ### So Long Google, and Thanks for All the Fish\n\n  * ### My WHCD experience\n\ndash theme for Jekyll by bitbrain made with\n\n", "frontpage": true}
