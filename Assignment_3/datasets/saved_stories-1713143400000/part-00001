But without\nbeing independent first, this is often a bad solution.\n\nWe rely on them to give us work, money, training, and respect. But being\ndependent on a job for everything, we are prey to things we cannot control.\nThe economy, the whims of our bosses, the luck of the draw in getting someone\nwho cares about us, trains us, and teaches us.\n\nWhat no one tells us is - to have an effective relationship with our\nemployers, we need to be independent.\n\nOnce we are, we become more attractive candidates, we can take our pick of\njobs, and we can wait to find the right one.\n\nRight now though, we are just told - study hard, have a good GPA, and once you\nget your first job, you will be happy.\n\nBut whether we like it or not, we are now all entrepreneurs. When we decide to\njoin a company, we hope they will pay us well, train us, and that the work we\ndo will be a reflection of our natural talents. This is by no means\nguaranteed.\n\nWe\u2019re playing poker with our time and money, but we\u2019ve always been told its a\nrace - reach the end and you win.\n\nThe reality is, the game only starts when we get our first job, and then its a\n40-50 year game we\u2019ve entered without knowing the rules.\n\nAnd so?\n\nThe solution here is to take control of our careers, to become independent.\n\nNot leave to chance developing skills that are valuable and joyful.\n\nNot leave to chance building a strong network that will propel us.\n\nNot leave to chance working on things we wish to see in the world.\n\nLearn how, at https://www.humaninsightventures.com/builder-apprenticeship\n\n### Subscribe to Human Insight Ventures Newsletter\n\nBy Devansh Jain \u00b7 Launched 7 days ago\n\nImpacting people is the surest way to change the world.
