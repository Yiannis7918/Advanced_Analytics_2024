Here\u2019s\nhow to make the most of the current standards and what lies ahead.\n\nCredit: Christopher Hebert/IDG\n\nNow that you\u2019re used to seeing co-workers, family, and strangers at coffee\nshops, offices, and planes using the oblong USB-C connector, it\u2019s time to see\njust what this promising standard can do today and tomorrow. As we approach\nits 10th birthday, the USB-C plug is now part and parcel of just about every\nnew laptop, phone, and tablet made. Even MacBooks, iPads, iPhones, and\nChromebooks now have USB-C ports, at least living up to the first part of its\nfull name: Universal Serial Bus.\n\nIn other words, the older rectangular USB Type-A plugs we are so used to are\nslowly going the way of the dinosaur. This evolution is happening faster in\nsome arenas than others. For example, the latest Mac Pro desktop has no fewer\nthan eight USB-C ports for anything from sending video to a display to\ncharging a phone.\n\nThe Acer Swift 1\u2019s right side holds two USB-A and one USB-C ports, a full HDMI\nport, plus an audio jack.\n\nMelissa Riofrio/IDG\n\n## What is USB-C?\n\nWithout a doubt, USB Type-C, commonly referred to as USB-C, is becoming the\nstandard connector for moving data and power to and from a wide variety of\ncomputing devices. Its symmetrical design means it can be inserted either way\n\u2014 up or down \u2014 eliminating many of the frustrations of earlier USB ports.\n\nThis alone makes it a hit for me. No more fumbling with plugs that always seem\nto be upside down.\n\nBecause it is a connector specification and not a data transfer protocol,\nUSB-C has been a constant as the underlying technology for moving data and\npowering devices has evolved. It\u2019s closely linked to several powerful new\ntechnologies, including Thunderbolt and Power Delivery, that have the\npotential to change how we think about our gear and how we work in the office,\non the road, and at home.\n\n## What is USB Type-C used for?\n\nLike USB Type-A connectors, Type-C USB ports and cables are used to transfer\npower and data between devices, from charging a phone to backing up data on an\nexternal drive. But USB-C\u2019s support for newer USB protocols and other\ntechnologies makes it much more powerful, capable of charging larger devices\nand delivering up to 8K video to an external display.\n\n## USB protocols and what they mean\n\nIt\u2019s when we start talking about protocols that things get messy. The five\nmain USB protocols in use today are confusing, to say the least, creating an\nalphabet soup of standards that could muddle the most technical among us.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the USB specifications, where it\u2019s best to concentrate\non the data flow levels:\n\n  * Today, the most popular USB spec is the USB 3.2 Gen 1 protocol that allows a maximum throughput of 5Gbps to travel over a single lane of data. It can use an old-school Type-A rectangular plug or the oblong USB-C connector.\n  * The next step up has two alternatives: the use of double speed lanes of data that abide by the 5Gbps speed limit (USB 3.2 Gen 1\u00d72) as well as a single-lane variant that operates at twice the speed (USB 3.2 Gen 2\u00d71). Generally compatible with each other, the result is 10Gbps peak throughput.\n  * The USB 3.2 Gen 2\u00d72 protocol uses two lanes of double-speed data traffic to top out at 20Gbps.\n  * USB4 (no space between \u201cUSB\u201d and \u201c4\u201d) is the newest protocol and incorporates the Thunderbolt 4 spec. Within USB4, there are several variants that provide 5, 10, 20 and 40Gbps of peak flow.\n\n### What\u2019s in a name? USB specs and speeds\n\nSpec Name| Top Speed| Single- or Dual-Lane Flow  \n---|---|---  \nUSB 3.2 Gen 1| 5 Gbps| Single  \nUSB 3.2 Gen 1\u00d72| 10 Gbps| Dual  \nUSB 3.2 Gen 2\u00d71| 10 Gbps| Single  \nUSB Gen 2\u00d72| 20 Gbps| Dual  \nUSB4| 40 Gbps| Dual  \n  \nThe final contemplated step up is USB4 v2, which takes data transfer speeds to\nnew heights by using PAM-3 pulse amplitude modulation technology. Derived from\n10Gbps Ethernet wired networking, PAM-3 tops out at 80Gbps in symmetric mode\nand gets to the spec\u2019s top speed of 120Gbps in asymmetric mode. Unfortunately,\nthese speed upgrades are off in the future.\n\n### Next up: Thunderbolt 5\n\nUsing USB4 v2 as a starting point, the next stage of USB-C\u2019s development will\nincorporate Thunderbolt 5, which was debuted by Intel last fall. Under normal\ncircumstances, it can move a maximum of 80Gbps, double the rate of Thunderbolt\n4 and USB4. This will help with everything from moving data onto and off flash\ndrives to running backups of company data and multipurpose docking stations.\n\nBut if more throughput is needed \u2014 such as for 8K video, which can require\n50Gbps \u2014 it uses a clever technique known as Bandwidth Boost. This pushes its\nspeed limit to 120Gbps when needed. It can also be useful for feeding video to\na screen at a refresh rate of up to 544Hz, which might find a home with a\ncompany\u2019s CAD designers, traders, or video editors.\n\nIt\u2019s another case of hurry up and wait. With Thunderbolt 4 gear just coming to\nmarket, expect to see computers with TB5 in 2024 and the first round of\naccessories in 2025. At the moment, there is no corresponding USB5 spec.\n\n## Gear up for new USB-C capabilities\n\nDespite the confusing name-game, older devices continue to work with the newer\nspecs. In other words, that two-year-old USB-C flash storage key will work\nwith your newest laptop, although not always at top speed.\n\nTo take full advantage of USB-C today, though, you\u2019ll need to get some new\ngear. Be careful, because not all USB-C devices on the market support all the\nlatest USB specs. For instance, just about every USB-C flash drive sold today\nsupports the earlier USB 3.2 Gen 1 protocol, and some tablets and phones don\u2019t\nsupport Alt Mode video (more on that in a moment). It\u2019s best to read the spec\nsheet carefully so you know what you\u2019re getting before you buy.\n\nI tried out some newer USB-C accessories to see the latest capabilities for\nmyself. Here\u2019s what to expect.\n\n### Docking station\n\nIn the here and now, the first USB4 devices flooding the market are docking\nstations that can make a laptop feel right at home on a desktop, moving data\nwhile charging the system. The $290 Plugable TBT4-UDX1 dock is connection\ncentral, with 11 ports and the ability to stream up to 96 watts to charge a\nlaptop. It includes four USB Gen 2 Type A ports capable of 10Gbps, two USB-C\nconnections that can push 40Gbps, and a 2.5Gbps networking port. There are\nalso more mundane amenities like an SD card slot, a headphone jack, and HDMI\nfor video.\n\nThe Plugable TBT4-UDX1 docking station.\n\nPlugable\n\nBy using a combination of the USB-C and HDMI ports, the UDX1 can drive up to\ntwo 4K monitors or a single 8K screen \u2014 that is, if you have the right cables\nand adapters.\n\nGetting it set up on my desk was a snap, because it didn\u2019t require any extra\nsoftware. I plugged in the dock\u2019s power adapter, connected it with the\nincluded Thunderbolt 4 cable to my Acer Swift Edge 16 notebook, and it\nimmediately started charging my system as fast as its included AC adapter. The\ndock worked smoothly with my keyboard, mouse, and wired Ethernet connection,\nas well as an Epson PowerLite L260F projector and my Logitech game controller,\nbecause 9 to 5 only lasts until 5PM.\n\n### Fast data storage\n\nThe UDX1 came into its own with the Kingston XS2000 USB 3.2 2X2 flash drive\nplugged in and connected to the Acer Swift Edge 16 laptop. Somewhat larger and\nheavier than the typical flash drive, the XS2000 measures 2.7 x 1.3 x 0.5\ninches and weighs 1 ounce. It fits into a pocket but requires a USB-C cable to\nconnect.\n\nThe Kingston XS2000 external SSD.\n\nKingston\n\nThe XS2000 read data at 7.90Gbps, as measured by the CrystalDiskMark benchmark\nsoftware \u2014 that\u2019s less than half the spec\u2019s 20Gbps speed limit but a huge\nincrease from the 1.23Gbps that I got using a SanDisk USB 3.1 flash drive.\nKingston sells XS2000 drives for $86 (500GB), $140 (1TB), $246 (2TB) and $450\n(4TB).\n\nUnfortunately, USB4 is so new that there weren\u2019t any external drives available\nfor my tests. So, I made one myself. Using the $120 Satechi USB4 NVMe SSD Pro\ndrive enclosure, I plugged in a Crucial P3 Plus 500GB SSD module. It upped the\ndata reading rate to an exceptional 29.5Gbps, about three-quarters of the\n40Gbps spec and one of the fastest drives available anywhere. Stay tuned: I\u2019ll\nshow you how to make the drive later in the story.\n\n### Power Delivery\n\nWhile a USB 2.0 port could deliver just 2.5 watts of power, about enough to\nslowly charge a phone, USB 3.1 upped this to about 4.5 watts, and the initial\nuses of USB-C topped out at 15 watts of power. Today, a single USB-C cable can\nhandle both video and power using USB\u2019s Power Delivery spec.\n\nHappily, USB4 increases this output to 100 watts for the base protocol and as\nmuch as 240 watts with the Extended Power Range specification. For practical\nreasons, most devices limit this to between 96 and 100 watts. Still, this\nopens up a brave new world of laptop-powered projectors based on USB-C.\n\nToday, though, Power Delivery is being used mostly for chargers, external\nbattery packs, and small displays such as Ricoh\u2019s Portable Monitor 150. Built\naround a 15.6-inch OLED screen, the $575 monitor not only shows 1920 x 1080\nresolution but adds the convenience of 10-point touch control and can be\npowered by a laptop or phone via the same USB-C cable that delivers video. It\nweighs just 1.2 pounds, has a fold-out stand, and comes with a slipcase; Ricoh\nsells an $80 stylus as well.\n\nThe Ricoh Portable Monitor 150.\n\nBrian Nadel / IDG\n\nIt displayed everything from web pages and emails to memos and Word documents\nfrom a Windows 11 notebook, but it really came into its own with a Samsung\nGalaxy Note 20 phone, allowing me to leave the laptop behind for a day trip.\nWhen it was time to present, I plugged the PM 150 into a USB adapter and to my\nphone with USB-C cables and pointed the display at the small group. The\nmonitor mirrored my phone\u2019s content, allowing me to give the full presentation\nwhile maintaining eye contact with the audience. Later, we huddled over the\ntouchscreen to modify a design using our fingers.\n\n### Alt Mode displays\n\nThe newest USB-C cables are capable of delivering video using USB-C\u2019s\nAlternate Mode, or \u201cAlt Mode.\u201d At the moment, a Thunderbolt 4/USB4 cable can\npush 8K video or supply several 4K displays. This breakthrough can neaten a\ndesk by getting rid of at least one cable.\n\nFor instance, Samsung\u2019s 43-inch M70B display can use a USB-C cable to not only\nsend video from a laptop to the screen but also send power the other way to\ncharge the system. The $430 model I looked at has a resolution of 3840 x 2160\npixels and was able to charge my Acer Swift Edge 16 and my Google Pixel 7\nphone.\n\nSamsung\u2019s 43-inch M70B display uses USB-C to receive video from and charge my\nlaptop.\n\nBrian Nadel / IDG\n\n### Cables\n\nTo get the most out of the new specs and the gear, you\u2019ll need the right\ncables. Happily, after a proliferation of cable types, there\u2019s a convergence\ngoing on. All Thunderbolt 4 cables will get the most out of USB4 devices, as\nwell as all the specs that came before it. In fact, it\u2019s so much of a no-\nbrainer that all I buy these days are TB4 cables. They work well for anything\nfrom moving data off my phone to feeding video to a display or backing up data\nto a drive.\n\nThe reason they work with all specs is that each USB cable has an\nidentification chip inside that senses the hardware\u2019s capability and sets the\nspeed and power abilities accordingly. Called e-marker, the integrated circuit\nis at both ends of the cable so that the USB device can query the cable\u2019s\ncapabilities and adjust the top speed to suit it. Older USB-C cables will\ngenerally work, just not always at top speed and might not work with the\nnewest equipment.\n\nMost of these cables are available in up to 2-meter lengths (about 6.6 feet),\nwhich is more than twice the standard 0.8-meter (31-inch) length of earlier\nUSB-C cables. That said, there are also one-meter cables from Satechi and\nPlugable for $30 and $29. By contrast, Apple pushes Thunderbolt 4 cabling to 3\nmeters (9.8 feet), but its Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable is pricey at $159.\n\nApple Thunderbolt 4 Pro Cable.\n\nApple\n\nOne of my favorite USB-C cables is the Baseus Free2Draw Mini Retractable USB-C\nCable 100W. Inside the Free2Draw\u2019s small circular cable winder is a 3.3-foot\nUSB 2.0 cable that can be spooled out at 1.1-, 1.9-, 2.7- or 3.3-foot lengths\nwithout getting tangled. Capable of delivering 100 watts to charge a phone,\ntablet, or laptop, it tops out at only 480Mbps of data.\n\n## Making USB-C work for you\n\nTo get the most out of these new specs, I\u2019ve had to make some changes and buy\nsome accessories. My older USB flash drives, keyboards and mice still work,\nthough, even if they can\u2019t take advantage of the new speeds.\n\nHere are some tools, tips, and DIY projects that will help make USB-C work for\nyou.\n\n### Make a USB-C travel kit\n\nThe good news is that USB-C ports can be used with older USB 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1\naccessories. The bad news is that you\u2019ll need a drawer full of adapters and\ncables. So far, I haven\u2019t seen anything close to a complete ready-made kit.\nSo, I\u2019ve made my own USB-C survival kit with key cables and adapters that fits\ninto an old Dopp bag.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s inside:\n\n  * A small male USB-C to female USB Type-A and a male USB Type A to female USB-C adapter.\n  * Short and long adapter cables with a USB Type-A male plug on one end and a male USB-C on the other.\n  * A USB-C AC adapter that\u2019s capable of delivering 30 watts.\n  * A Thunderbolt 4 cable with USB-C male plugs at each end for using accessories.\n  * A USB-C Ethernet adapter and short Ethernet jumper cable for when a wired connection is available.\n  * One HDMI cable.\n  * A small microfiber cloth for screen cleaning.\n\nThe center of attention is Satechi\u2019s Thunderbolt 4 Slim Hub, which squeezes\nlots of connections into a small and light device. It delivers three 40Gbps\nThunderbolt 4/USB4 connections as well as a 10Gbps USB 3.2 Gen 2 port, while\nsupplying up to 15 watts of power to charge my phone. It can run an 8K screen\nor a pair of 4K ones but needs a fairly large and heavy 20-volt AC adapter\nthat makes it a tight fit.\n\nThe essential travel companion: my homemade USB-C adapter kit.\n\nBrian Nadel / IDG\n\nThere\u2019s one additional adapter I\u2019ve found essential on the road because,\nsadly, many phones and tablets now lack a headphone jack. I have USB-C earbuds\nbut usually can\u2019t find them when I need them. When that happens, I use a\nheadphone jack adapter so I can use any inexpensive wired headphones with my\nPixel 7 phone. They cost about $10 each.\n\n### Make an inexpensive (and fast) homemade SSD drive\n\nUSB4 may yield fast data speeds, but flash drives that support the spec have\nbeen slow to market. Using Satechi\u2019s USB4 NVMe SSD Pro Enclosure, I made my\nown. It tops out at 40Gbps and is compatible with all the older USB-C and\nThunderbolt specs, although at 4.4 x 2.7 x 1.0 inches and 7 ounces, it is\nlarger and heavier than the typical flash drive.\n\nThe Satechi USB4 NVME SSD Pro Enclosure.\n\nSatechi\n\nThe Satechi enclosure can be used with a B or B+M NVMe storage card up to 4TB.\nIn addition to the $120 enclosure, I used a 500GB Crucial P3 Plus module that\ncost me $30.\n\nThe best part is that it doesn\u2019t require tools to put together.\n\nI started by sliding the enclosure\u2019s lock open, freeing the lid.\n\nBrian Nadel / IDG\n\nNext, I slid the NVMe module into the connector and locked it in place with\nthe soft silicon plug; it allows the use of three different-sized cards.\n\nBrian Nadel / IDG\n\nI finished by applying the included thermal pad and replacing the lid.\n\nBrian Nadel / IDG\n\nI snapped the case shut and was done.\n\nBrian Nadel / IDG\n\nIt was worth the effort, because after I plugged it into the Plugable dock, it\nwas able to move nearly 30Gbps. Not bad for a few minutes of work.\n\n### Be a power traveler\n\nI travel a lot for work and pleasure, and it always seems as though my phone\u2019s\nbattery is at 20%. My latest trick to keep from being cut off from the world\nis the $30 Anker Nano Power Bank. It\u2019s small, only adds 3.5 ounces to the\nweight of the phone, and has a unique swiveling USB-C connector that has\nworked with every phone I\u2019ve tried. There\u2019s also a port on the side for\ncharging it and as an alternate way to charge a device.\n\nThe Anker Nano Power Bank can juice up my phone anywhere.\n\nBrian Nadel / IDG\n\nAvailable in five colors, the Nano Power Bank\u2019s 5,000 miliamp-hour battery can\nput out 18 watts \u2014 about what the typical AC adapter delivers. Able to provide\nhours of extra juice, the five-dot LED charge gauge shows how much power is\nleft.\n\nThere\u2019s one more USB-C power trick I use every day with my Android work tablet\nthat makes connecting and disconnecting much easier. The iSkey Magnetic USB C\nAdapter is a knock-off of Apple\u2019s MagSafe design, where one part plugs into\nthe tablet and the other into a USB cable. Inside, these two parts have\npowerful magnets that snap together to make a physical and electrical\nconnection when they\u2019re within a couple inches of each other. Later, when it\u2019s\ntime to move around the office, I pull the two apart. The best part is that it\ncosts about $20.\n\niSkey\u2019s Magnetic USB C Adapter imitates Apple\u2019s MagSafe connector.\n\nBrian Nadel/IDG\n\n## Troubleshooting USB-C\n\nThe fact that there isn\u2019t much to adjust or configure with USB (C or\notherwise) is a testament to its technological success. New or old, in almost\nall cases, it just works. That is, until it doesn\u2019t. At that point, there are\nseveral angles of attack for troubleshooting.\n\nMy first step is to take a look at what the cable is doing, or not. For\ninstance, I was having problems with my MacBook Air not reliably charging. To\nsee what was going on with the USB-C charging, I inserted Plugable\u2019s USBC-\nMETER3-1MF diagnostic cable ($20) between the AC adapter and the notebook.\n\nThe cable meets the USB 3.1 Gen 2 10Gbps spec and can handle up to 240 watts\nof power; its built-in OLED screen shows how much electricity is flowing. In\nmy case, it was 1 or 2 watts, not the 20 watts it should be. After jiggling\nthe cord to see the power flow jump to a more normal level, I concluded that\nthe charging cable had an intermittent short. Replacing it did the trick and I\nhaven\u2019t had any problems since.\n\nThe Plugable USB-C cable with multimeter tester.\n\nBrian Nadel / IDG\n\nMy second step is to use Windows\u2019 built-in USB tools. In addition to notifying\nme of a problem, the Settings screen in Windows 10 and 11 has a way to bring\nunresponsive USB devices back to life. If you\u2019re having USB problems on a\nWindows 10 or 11 device, try these tips:\n\n  1. Go to the Device Manager by right-clicking on This PCin File Explorer and then clicking Properties. Under \u201cRelated settings,\u201d click Device Managernear the bottom to bring up a list of devices. In the Device Manager, double-click Universal Serial Bus controllers in the list to reveal the actual controller. It should read something like \u201cUSB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller.\u201d Give that a right-click, then choose Properties. In the Power Management tab, uncheck the box next to Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power to keep the port powered up. But be warned: your battery might drain faster because of this change.\n\nKeep the USB port powered up by unchecking the box.\n\nBrian Nadel / IDG\n\n  2. While there, updating the USB drivers couldn\u2019t hurt. You can do this by choosing the USB device that\u2019s not working, right-clicking, and choosing Update driverfrom the drop-down list.\n  3. Finally, check the specs of the computer, device, and cable to make sure they all match.\n\nWith Thunderbolt the underlying transfer technology for USB4, the Thunderbolt\nControl Center can provide insight. The app, which generally appears in the\nWindows Start menu apps list (and can also be downloaded from the Microsoft\nStore), interrogates the system\u2019s Thunderbolt controller chip to maximize\nthroughput and shows what Thunderbolt devices are online. At the bottom are\ndetails on whether it\u2019s connected and how it\u2019s powered. Click on the About\nsection on the left to see a deeper level of detail. This includes the\nThunderbolt version the controller supports.\n\nGet details about connected Thunderbolt devices via the Thunderbolt Control\nCenter.\n\nBrian Nadel / IDG\n\nFinally, when all else fails, try cleaning the physical USB-C port, because\ndust, dirt, and debris might be preventing an electrical connection.
