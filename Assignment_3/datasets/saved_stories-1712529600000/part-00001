Cook & Yu Xie\n\n## Introduction\n\nHistorically, the confluence of technological advancements and their\nimplications for economic trajectories has remained at the forefront of\nacademic and societal discourse. While many technological advancements have\nspurred economic growth, the rise of artificial intelligence has particularly\ndriven academic interest in understanding its economic impact. The formal\nbeginning of artificial intelligence as a discipline dates back to the\nmid-20th century, marked by the significant Dartmouth symposium led by\nMcCarthy in 1956. This conference marked the first use of the term \u2018artificial\nintelligence,\u2019 though its definition was not universally agreed upon.\nMcCarthy\u2019s postulations encapsulated artificial intelligence as a quest to\narchitect intelligent beings, predominantly through cognitive computing\nparadigms. Today, the combination of vast data resources and advanced\ncomputing methods has propelled artificial intelligence to the forefront of\ntechnological innovation. This momentum is evident in the burgeoning\ninvestments by major economies, identifying artificial intelligence\u2019s\nprospective role in galvanizing economic expansion. Additionally, research by\nAshraf (2022) and Allal-Ch\u00e9rif (2022) has shown how artificial intelligence is\ninfluencing various aspects of society, including religion.\n\nThe diverse role of religion in society, outlined by Gowan (2004) and further\nsupported by Basedau et al. (2016), Demiroglu et al. (2017), and Mayoral and\nEsteban (2019), highlights its significant impact on social structures and\nsocioeconomic patterns. Historically, there has been a deep connection between\nreligious rituals and economic processes, dating back to ancient civilizations\nthat linked spiritual activities with economic production. Contemporary\nreligion, while evolving in its ideologies, continues to have a noticeable and\nsubtle influence on economic trends. Modern religious organizations have\nexpanded beyond their traditional roles and now function as significant\neconomic entities. They not only steward sacred rites but also delve into\nsecular commercial realms, exemplified by endeavors like the merchandising of\nspiritual artifacts and the augmentation of faith-based tourism. According to\nHodge et al. (2020), Janah et al. (2020), and Steiner et al. (2020), some\nreligious institutions have become powerful economic forces, with key\nspiritual leaders playing central roles in economic initiatives. The economic\nimprint of religious entities further extends to engendering niche production\navenues, driven by their distinct consumer behaviors. Canonical teachings, in\nmany instances, proffer economic wisdom, guiding community fiscal paradigms.\nAt junctures, religious doctrines synergize with and fortify state-economic\nstrategies. Conclusively, the interplay of religious tenets and economic\nframeworks remains a testament to their co-evolution and mutual reinforcement\nin societal progress.\n\nBased on comprehensive analyses, the significant interplay between artificial\nintelligence and religion in shaping economic trends becomes clear. This study\nexplores these interactions across 26 countries from 2000 to 2021. Using panel\nvector auto-regression analysis, the study identifies a strong positive\ncorrelation between artificial intelligence, religious freedom, and factors of\neconomic growth. Insights from forecast-error variance decomposition highlight\nthe growing importance of these interconnected factors in shaping future\neconomic trends. The research also emphasizes the continued importance of\ntraditional economic factors, mainly labor and capital. The veracity and\nrobustness of the elucidated relationships are further substantiated by the\nToda-Yamamoto Granger causality scrutiny. Overall, this study reinforces basic\neconomic principles and uncovers new synergies, providing valuable insights\nfor scholars, policymakers, and economic analysts.\n\nThis study offers three key contributions to the existing literature on the\nintersection of artificial intelligence, religious freedom, and economic\ngrowth. First, our research explores the relationship between artificial\nintelligence, religious freedom, and economic growth. Drawing from an\nextensive dataset spanning 26 nations over the course of two decades\n(2000\u20132021), we identify a salient positive interrelation among these\nelements. This elucidation bridges a lacuna in the academic discourse,\nspotlighting the symbiotic manner in which technological strides and\nsociocultural paradigms confluence to mold the economic tapestry of countries.\nSecondly, our methodological approach, combining panel vector auto-regression\nand forecast-error variance decomposition, adds depth to economic forecasting\nliterature. This framework not only identifies existing relationships but also\npredicts future economic trends, underscoring the burgeoningly pivotal role of\nartificial intelligence and religious liberties in sculpting future economic\nvistas. Finally, amidst the prevailing scholarly narrative on economic\nascension replete with contemporary determinants, our study highlights the\nongoing importance of traditional growth drivers, especially labor and\ncapital. Concurrently, the incorporation of the Toda-Yamamoto Granger\ncausality examination reinforces the cogency of this standpoint, engendering a\ncomprehensive comprehension of both time-honored and nascent economic growth\nstimuli. In summary, our findings provide new insights and methodological\nadvancements, enriching academic discussions in the fields of economic\nscience, technology evolution, and sociocultural dynamics.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this article are structured as delineated below:\nsection \u201cLiterature review\u201d delves into a review of extant literature,\nassimilating and synthesizing prior academic pursuits within this domain.\nSection \u201cVariable and PVAR model\u201d elucidates the research design, accentuating\nthe selected variables and the foundational theoretical underpinnings. The\nsection \u201cResults and Discussion\u201d provides a comprehensive analysis of the\nderived empirical results. In culmination, the section \u201cConclusions\u201d distills\nthe principal takeaways, proffers policy recommendations, and earmarks\nprospective avenues for continued scholarly inquiry in this field.\n\n## Literature review\n\nScholars have long postulated the intricate interplay between artificial\nintelligence and economic growth. Early observations by Aghion et al. (2017)\nposited that artificial intelligence might merely be a new technological tool,\nakin to past innovations, with short-lived economic implications. However, as\nargued by Walton and Nayak (2021) and Borrellas and Unceta (2021), artificial\nintelligence\u2019s adaptive learning capacity marked a departure from previous\ntechnologies, implying a more transformative role in economies. Contrarily,\nLiang et al. (2022) cautioned against over-optimism, suggesting artificial\nintelligence could displace jobs faster than it creates them. Building on\nthis, Osoba and Welser (2017) and Vermeulen et al. (2017) empirically\ndemonstrated a direct correlation between artificial intelligence advancements\nand short-term job displacement but also highlighted an eventual shift towards\nnewer job roles. Expanding this perspective, Damioli et al. (2021) and\nCzarnitzki et al. (2023) underscored the significance of artificial\nintelligence in boosting productivity, particularly in sectors like\nmanufacturing and finance. Cockburn et al. (2018) and \u00c5str\u00f6m et al. (2022)\nasserted that artificial intelligence\u2019s real potential lies in its ability to\ntrigger innovation and create new market sectors. However, Makridakis (2017)\nand Lim (2022) contended that the economic benefits of artificial intelligence\ncould be unevenly distributed, leading to increased economic disparities. A\nmeta-analysis by Berdiyeva et al. (2021) synthesized these viewpoints,\nsuggesting that while artificial intelligence can be a potent catalyst for\neconomic growth, its effects are multifaceted and can vary based on regional,\nsectoral, and policy contexts. Collectively, the literature underscores the\nprofound yet debatable potential of artificial intelligence in shaping future\neconomic trajectories.\n\nRecent decades have seen an increasing focus on the complex relationship\nbetween religious freedom and economic growth, with scholars exploring various\naspects of this dynamic. Gill and Owen IV (2017) and Gill (2013) pointed out\nthe potential economic implications of religious liberty, suggesting an\nintricate relationship. This notion was further expanded by Qayyum et al.\n(2020), who illustrated religious freedom\u2019s role as a catalyst for prosperity.\nCao et al. (2019) pivoted the discourse to trade dynamics, suggesting that\nreligious tolerance could foster international commerce. This trade-centric\nviewpoint was contrasted by Squicciarini (2020), who took a more macroeconomic\nstance, emphasizing the broader financial implications of religious liberties.\nWhile the majority of the literature has focused on the positive aspects,\nPrasadh and Thenmozhi (2019) cautioned about the differential impacts in\nemerging economies. This heterogeneity was further examined by Mavelli (2020),\nwho revealed an unexpected connection between religious freedom and financial\nmarkets. Kim et al. (2021), Shahzad et al. (2014), and Gutsche (2019) took a\nmore microeconomic approach, investigating how these liberties influence\ninvestment patterns and entrepreneurship, respectively. On a continental\nscale, Oyekan (2023) highlighted Africa\u2019s unique experience, showing both the\nupsides and downsides of religious diversity for economic growth.\nConclusively, Gill\u2019s (2021) comprehensive analysis quantified this\nrelationship, cementing the understanding that religious liberty plays a\npivotal role in economic expansion. In summary, while there is a consensus on\nthe significant role of religious liberty in economic growth, the exact nature\nand extent of this relationship continue to be subjects of debate,\nhighlighting the need for further research.\n\nThe contribution of labor and capital inputs to economic growth is a well-\nexplored area in economic studies, with scholars examining various aspects of\ntheir impact. Shahbaz et al. (2019) posited that the dynamics of the labor\nforce serve as a foundational driver of economic expansion. Abbas et al.\n(2020) echoed a parallel sentiment but shifted focus to capital formation,\nhighlighting its indispensable role in bolstering growth. Azenui and Rada\n(2021) then emphasized the crucial role of labor productivity in shaping\nmacroeconomic outcomes. However, Topcu et al. (2020) brought the discourse\nback to the significance of capital accumulation for long-term growth\ntrajectories. Ahmed et al. (2020) added complexity by discussing potential\nconstraints on growth due to interplays between labor and capital inputs. This\nsentiment was expanded by Han and Lee (2020), who underscored the challenge of\nlabor skills mismatches in contemporary growth scenarios. Alshubiri (2022)\nthen discussed the nuances of investment dynamics, emphasizing the non-\nlinearities in growth patterns influenced by capital. Curtin et al. (2019)\nquantitatively assessed capital investment patterns and their correlation with\ngrowth, suggesting a robust relationship. Meanwhile, Liotti (2020) argued for\nlabor flexibility, underscoring its pivotal implications for sustainable\neconomic growth. Lastly, Nordhaus (2021) deliberated on the concept of capital\ndeepening, proposing its central role in shaping future economic prospects. In\nconclusion, while there is broad agreement on the importance of labor and\ncapital in economic growth, the specifics of their interplay and the\nconstraints they face are still topics of ongoing discussion and research in\nthe field of economics.\n\nReviewing the studies mentioned earlier reveals a clear story about how\nartificial intelligence and religious freedom jointly influence economic\nprogress. These studies, known for their methodological rigor and reliance on\nempirical data, highlight how AI innovations and the extent of religious\nfreedom jointly shape economic paths. The interconnections identified in this\nresearch point to a growing need for more in-depth studies. Such future work\nshould aim to further clarify the complex relationships between artificial\nintelligence and religious freedom and their combined effects on economic\ndevelopment.\n\n## Variable and PVAR model\n\n### Variable\n\nThis study investigates how artificial intelligence and religious freedom\ninteract with traditional economic drivers like labor and capital to influence\neconomic growth. We examine data from 26 countries from 2000 to 2021, focusing\non the role of AI, religious freedom, and their impact on economic\ndevelopment. AI progress is measured by the number of AI-related patent\nfilings in these countries. Religious freedom is evaluated on a scale from 0\nto 1, where a higher score indicates greater religious liberties. We assess\neconomic growth using each country\u2019s gross domestic product. Capital input is\nanalyzed through gross capital formation, and labor input is considered in\nterms of employment rates. Detailed information on these variables and the\ndata sample is available in Tables 1 and 2.\n\nTable 1 Sample description.\n\nFull size table\n\nTable 2 Variable description.\n\nFull size table\n\n### PVAR model\n\nBuilding on the foundational economic theory of the production function, which\nidentifies labor and capital as key drivers of output, this study introduces\nnew variables, specifically artificial intelligence and religious freedom, to\nextend the traditional framework. We ground our research in Solow\u2019s (1956)\nneoclassical growth model, recognizing technological progress, akin to the\nrole of artificial intelligence, as a vital component of economic development.\nAdditionally, we draw on Robinson and Acemoglu\u2019s (2012) work on the impact of\ninstitutions, such as religious freedom, on economic outcomes. This study aims\nto update and expand Romer\u2019s (1990) endogenous growth theory by suggesting\nthat both knowledge and societal constructs like religious freedom can\ninternally drive economic growth. By combining these established theories, our\nresearch seeks to clarify how emerging factors, such as artificial\nintelligence and religious freedoms, integrate with and impact traditional\neconomic models to influence economic growth. The adapted production function\nwe propose is outlined as follows:\n\n$${{{\\mathrm{eg}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} =\n{{{\\mathrm{Ali}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}^{{{\\mathrm{a}}}}{{{\\mathrm{ci}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}^{{{\\mathrm{b}}}}{{{\\mathrm{ai}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}^{{{\\mathrm{c}}}}{{{\\mathrm{rf}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}^{{{\\mathrm{d}}}}.$$\n\n(1)\n\nIn Eq. (1), i is utilized to denote individual countries, while t is\nrepresentative of specific years under consideration. A is employed to\nencapsulate total factor productivity, a measure that captures the efficiency\nof input-to-output transformation in production processes. The coefficients a,\nb, c, and d correspondingly represent the proportionate shares of the output\nattributed to each distinct input factor. Notably, the condition a + b + c + d\n= 1 is maintained, which underscores the premise of consistent returns to\nscale in the production function. This implies that a proportional increase in\nall inputs will result in an equivalent proportional increase in output,\nthereby reflecting the consistent nature of productive efficiency across\nvarying scales of operation. Following He et al. (2022)\u2019s methodology, we\napply a logarithmic transformation to the linear models to stabilize the\nvariance-covariance matrix. This allows us to reformulate Eq. (1) in an\nalternative way, as shown below:\n\n$${{logeg}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} = {{logA}} +\n{{alogli}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} +\n{{blogci}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} +\n{{clogai}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} +\n{{dlogrf}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} + \\epsilon\n_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}.$$\n\n(2)\n\nIn our analysis, detailed in Eq. (2), \u2208 represents the white noise component.\nWe adopt the panel vector auto-regression framework, as introduced by Love and\nZicchino (2006), to explore the complex interactions between artificial\nintelligence, religious dynamics, and economic growth. The PVAR model is\nparticularly effective for this study as it can handle individual differences\nover time through fixed effects. This approach significantly enhances the\naccuracy and reliability of our empirical results. The PVAR model\u2019s strengths\nare numerous, making it highly effective at untangling complex macroeconomic\nrelationships. M\u00fcgge (2016) notes that the model is flexible, focusing on\nmacroeconomic fluctuations without being limited to any specific growth or\ndevelopmental theories. Similarly, Charfeddine and Kahia (2019) emphasize the\nimportance of an objective analytical approach, warning that biases can\ndistort the interpretation of results.\n\nThe PVAR framework stands out for its approach to treating all variables as\nendogenous, moving beyond the traditional separation into exogenous and\nendogenous categories. This model considers the evolution of each variable as\ninfluenced by both its past behavior and the simultaneous activities of other\nvariables, highlighting their mutual dependence and interactions. It also\nallows for the analysis of both internal and external influences, which are\ncrucial in shaping macroeconomic trends in interconnected economies. Due to\nits efficient design and ability to provide insightful estimations, the PVAR\nmodel is highly effective for analyzing panel data, whether it spans multiple\ncountries or focuses on a single entity. In our study, we leveraged the PVAR\nmodel\u2019s strengths to explore the interplay among artificial intelligence,\nreligious freedom, and economic growth across 26 countries from 2000 to 2021.\nConsequently, we present Eq. (2) as follows:\n\n$${{y}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} = \\mu _{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} +\n{{a}}\\left( {{l}} \\right){{y}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} + \\alpha\n_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} + \\delta _{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} + \\epsilon\n_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}.$$\n\n(3)\n\nIn Eq. (3), y_i,t represents a set of stable variables, including ai, rf, eg,\nli, and ci. Concurrently, the term \u03bc_i symbolizes the matrix capturing\ncountry-specific idiosyncratic effects. The matrix polynomial, operating\nwithin the designated series, is denoted by a(l), [a(l) = \u03b1_1l^1 + \u03b1_2l^2 +\n... + \u03b1_p]), wherein \u03b1_i acts as the vector elucidating the distinct country-\nspecific influences assimilated into the regression analysis. \u03b4_t is tasked\nwith embodying the dummy indicators tailored for each country\u2019s unique annual\ndata points. The PVAR model uses an efficient matrix notation in Eq. (3),\noffering a clear view of the complex interconnections among artificial\nintelligence, religious freedom, and economic growth in the analyzed countries\nand time frame.\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{{{\\mathrm{{\\Delta}}}logai}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}\n= \\mu _{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} + \\mathop {\\sum}\\limits_{{{j}}

In our model, we\nincorporate fixed effects, denoted as \u03b1_i, to account for unique variations in\ndifferent empirical contexts. These fixed effects include country-specific\ninfluences, represented by \u03bc_i, which capture persistent national factors not\ndirectly observable. The combination of country-specific fixed effects and\nlagged variables in our model presents challenges due to their correlation. We\naddress this by either applying the mean-difference technique or using the\nadvanced \u2018Helmert transformation\u2019, both of which ensure the independence of\nlagged factors from transformed predictors, enhancing the reliability of our\nestimations using the system-generalized method of moments.\n\nIn the PVAR framework, as detailed in Eq. (3), annual effects are captured by\n\u03b1_i, which effectively accounts for global macroeconomic changes impacting all\ncountries. Before integrating these variables into our model, it\u2019s crucial to\ndifferentiate them to highlight yearly variations. In our study, these\nvariables align with the system\u2019s theoretical setup. A notable strength of the\nPVAR methodology is its ability to analyze the effects of independent\ndisturbances, examining the influence of one variable on another while\nassuming other factors remain constant. This depth of analysis is achieved\nthrough the panel impulse response function, which traces the response of a\nspecific variable to changes in another, assuming all other influences are\nneutralized. To accurately map these impulse responses, we calculate\nconfidence intervals using Monte Carlo simulations with 10,000 bootstrap\niterations. Additionally, we conduct variance decomposition to unravel how\nmuch of the variance in one variable is due to changes in another. Our\nanalysis primarily focuses on the impacts observed over a decade.\n\n### Panel unit root tests\n\nBefore using the panel vector auto-regression framework for empirical\nanalysis, confirming the stationarity of included variables is crucial.\nBroadly speaking, tests for panel data unit roots bifurcate into two primary\nsegments: those predicated on the premise of cross-sectional independence and\nthose receptive to cross-sectional interdependence. Prototypical examples of\nthe former encompass methodologies propounded by Maddala and Wu (1999), Levin\net al. (2002), Im et al. (2003), and Hadri (2000), which were rooted in the\nnotion of cross-sectional autonomy. Alternatively, the latter spectrum is\nillustrated by procedures outlined by Smith et al. (2004), Moon and Perron\n(2004), Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. (2005), and Pesaran (2007), which are\nattuned to the nuances of cross-sectional synergies. However, O\u2019Connell (1998)\nastutely observed that neglecting a pronounced orthogonal residue cross-\nsectional positive affinity can compromise the integrity of panel unit root\ntests founded on cross-sectional independence, culminating in potential\nanalytical aberrations due to size distortion. This underscores the pivotal\nimportance of meticulously appraising cross-sectional interrelationships as a\nprelude to the judicious selection of an estimator tailored for panel\ninquiries. In the pursuit of discerning cross-sectional dependencies, the\npresent investigation will leverage the diagnostic apparatus delineated by\nPesaran (2007), striving for analytical rigor and credibility in subsequent\nevaluations.\n\n#### Pesaran diagnostic test\n\nRecognizing the limitations of the Breusch and Pagan (1980) Lagrange\nmultiplier test in assessing cross-sectional interdependencies, especially\nregarding its effectiveness and temporal accuracy, Pesaran (2021) developed a\nmore refined Lagrangian multiplier test method. This advanced approach\nprovides a deeper and more precise examination of cross-sectional\ndependencies. In this study, we apply Pesaran\u2019s enhanced metrics to thoroughly\nanalyze cross-sectional dependence, as elaborated in the following sections:\n\n$${{{\\mathrm{CD}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{LM}}}}} = \\left( {\\frac{1}{{{{N}}\\left( {{{N}}\n- 1} \\right)}}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\,\\mathop {\\sum}\\limits_{{{i}} =\n1}^{{{N}} - 1} \\cdot \\mathop {\\sum}\\limits_{{{j}} = {{i}} + 1}^{{N}} {\\left(\n{{{{\\mathrm{T}}}}\\check \\rho _{{{{\\mathrm{ij}}}}}^2 - 1} \\right)} .$$\n\n(9)\n\nIn Eq. (9), the disturbance\u2019s product-moment correlation coefficient is\nsymbolized by \u03c1_i,j. Under the asymptotic conditions, the LM test statistic\ntends towards a normal distribution characterized by parameters T \u2192 \u221e and N \u2192\n\u221e, with the foundational assumptions that [under the null: \\\\(\\rho\n_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{j}}}}} = \\rho\n_{{{{\\mathrm{j}}}},{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}} = 0\\\\) when i \u2260 j; and under the\nalternative: \\\\(\\rho _{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{j}}}}} = \\rho\n_{{{{\\mathrm{j}}}},{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}} \\ne 0\\\\) for at least one pair where i \u2260\nj]. Nevertheless, when the dimension N overshadows T, potential distortions in\nthe test\u2019s size properties can be observed. Recognizing the limitations\nintrinsic to such configurations, Pesaran (2021) advanced a nuanced diagnostic\nmechanism for probing cross-sectional interdependencies, adeptly crafted for\nstructures marked by expansive N- and limited T-values. This cutting-edge\ndiagnostic derives its foundation from the pairwise correlation of residuals,\nwhich are extrapolated from the quintessential augmented Dickey-Fuller\nparadigm, applicable to every individual element within the panel dataset.\nIt\u2019s paramount to underscore that this refined methodology circumvents the\nquadratic components integral to the conventional LM evaluation. With these\nmodifications, the refined metric for assessing cross-sectional dependence is\ndefined as follows:\n\n$${{{\\mathrm{CD}}}} = \\left( {\\frac{{2{{{\\mathrm{T}}}}}}{{{{N}}\\left( {{{N}} -\n1} \\right)}}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\,\\mathop {\\sum}\\limits_{{{i}} = 1}^{{{N}}\n- 1} \\cdot \\mathop {\\sum}\\limits_{{{j}} = {{i}} + 1}^{{N}} {\\left( {\\check\n\\rho _{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{j}}}}}^2} \\right)} .$$\n\n(10)\n\nWhen postulating the null hypothesis of an absence of cross-sectional\ninterdependence, the cross-sectional dependence metric is anticipated to\nadhere to a normal distribution irrespective of the sequential positioning of\nT \u2192 \u221e and N \u2192 \u221e. In his seminal work, Pesaran (2007) expounded upon the\nsufficiency of a limited cadre of high-caliber sample attributes (manifested\nby diminutive values of both N and T) in facilitating robust evaluations via\ncross-sectional dependence statistical assessments. Building on this\nnarrative, both Pesaran (2007) and Smith et al. (2004) accentuated that, in\nscenarios where the empirical evidence negates the null hypothesis, thus\nunderscoring cross-sectional interdependence, it becomes imperative to\ntransition towards executing the pertinent panel unit root examinations. With\nan aim to authenticate the stationarity of individual variables while\naccommodating the inherent cross-sectional dependence within the panel, the\npresent inquiry judiciously harnesses the panel unit root evaluation\nmethodologies championed by Smith et al. (2004) as well as Pesaran (2007).\n\n#### Unit root test developed by Pesaran (2007)\n\nIn his work, Pesaran (2007) advanced a cross-sectional refinement of the IPS\ntest as originally delineated by Im et al. (2003), which fundamentally\npremised on the autonomy of individual units. The impetus behind this\nenhancement stemmed from the realization that a plethora of macroeconomic\nendeavors manifested inherent temporal correlations when scrutinizing data at\nregional or national granularities. Delving deeper, Pesaran (2007) undertook a\nmeticulous reevaluation of the assumption of cross-sectional independence and\nconsequently proffered a unit-factorial model, adeptly integrating residuals\ncharacterized by divergent loading factors. In a bid to bolster the\ntraditional Augmented Dickey-Fuller paradigm, he advocated the incorporation\nof cross-sectional means of lagged levels alongside the initial disparities of\ndistinct variables. Subsequently, this discourse elucidates the cross-\nsectional refinement of the augmented Dickey-Fuller assessment.\n\n$${\\mathrm{{\\Delta}}}y_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} = \\pi\n_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} + \\beta\n_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}{{y}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} - 1} + \\omega\n{{{\\check y}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} - 1} + \\theta\n_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}{\\mathrm{{\\Delta}}}\\check{{y}}_{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} + \\epsilon\n_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}.$$\n\n(11)\n\nWithin the framework of Eq. (6), \\\\({{{\\check{\\mathrm y}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} =\n{\\textstyle{{\\mathop {\\sum}\\nolimits_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} = 1}^{{{\\mathrm{N}}}}\n{\\left( {{{{\\mathrm{y}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}} \\right)} }\n\\over {{{\\mathrm{N}}}}}}\\\\). \\\\({\\mathrm{{\\Delta}}}\\check\n{\\mathrm{y}}_{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} = {\\textstyle{{\\mathop\n{\\sum}\\nolimits_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} = 1}^{{{\\mathrm{N}}}} {\\left(\n{{{{\\mathrm{{\\Delta}}}y}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}} \\right)} }\n\\over {{{\\mathrm{N}}}}}}\\\\). Pesaran (2007) meticulously formulated a panel\nunit root examination predicated on the cross-sectional average of singular\naugmented Dickey-Fuller metrics. In a subsequent endeavor, Pesaran (2007)\nproffered a refined iteration of the IPS test, which is delineated herein:\n\n$${{{\\mathrm{NIPS}}}} = \\frac{{\\mathop {\\sum}\\nolimits_{{{i}} = 1}^{{N}}\n{\\left( {{{{\\mathrm{NADF}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}} \\right)} }}{{{{N}}}}.$$\n\n(12)\n\nWithin the context of Eq. (12), NADF_i denotes the cross-sectional\ncontemporary Augmented Dickey-Fuller metric for each individual unit,\nsymbolized by (i), which aligns with the t-statistic associated with \u03b2_i in\nEq. (10). Moreover, Pesaran (2007) ascertained the critical thresholds for\nNIPS, factoring in diverse sample dimensions.\n\n#### Unit root test developed by Smith et al. (2004)\n\nSmith et al. (2004) utilized the bootstrap panel unit root assessment to\nconfirm the stationarity of a given variable, a method that aptly accommodates\nboth cross-sectional and time series attributes of a datum. This assessment is\na refined version of the panel unit root test proposed by Im et al. (2003).\n\\\\(\\overline {{{{\\mathrm{LM}}}}} = {\\textstyle{{\\mathop\n{\\sum}\\nolimits_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} = 1}^{{{\\mathrm{N}}}}\n{{{{\\mathrm{KM}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}} } \\over {{{\\mathrm{N}}}}}}\\\\) designates\nthe mean of individual Lagrange multiplier (LM_i) test statistics, a concept\noriginally introduced by Solo (1984). The test fashioned by Leybourne (1995)\nis represented by \\\\(\\overline {{{{\\mathrm{max}}}}}\\\\), while \\\\(\\overline\n{{{{\\mathrm{min}}}}} = {\\textstyle{{\\mathop {\\sum}\\nolimits_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}\n= 1}^{{{\\mathrm{N}}}} {{{{\\mathrm{min}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}} } \\over\n{{{\\mathrm{N}}}}}}\\\\) is indicative of a robust alternative to the individual\nLagrange multiplier, such that \\\\({{{\\mathrm{min}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} =\n{{{\\mathrm{min}}}}\\left(\n{{{{\\mathrm{LM}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{fi}}}}},{{{\\mathrm{LM}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{ri}}}}}}\n\\right)\\\\). LM_fi is predicated upon forward regression techniques, whereas\nthe LM_ri is anchored in backward regression methodologies. This quartet of\nevaluations is predicated on the unit test, where the null hypothesis\npostulates and contrasts against the heterogeneity of the auto-regressive root\nunder the alternative stance. A negation of the null hypothesis suggests\nstationarity is evident in at least one of the countries under consideration.\n\n### Cointegration test for panel-dependent units developed by Westerlund\n(2006)\n\nWhile the panel cointegration methodology of Pedroni (1999) is a popular\nchoice among scholars, its assumption of cross-sectional independence has been\ncriticized as overly constraining, particularly by Banerjee and Carrion-i-\nSilvestre (2006). When cross-sectional dependence exists within a panel, many\nturn to the cointegration test formulated by Westerlund (2006). Distinguished\nfrom residual-based cointegration evaluations, this test sidesteps the\npitfalls associated with the common factor constraint. As elucidated by\nKremers et al. (1992), this constraint emerges when there is congruence\nbetween the long-term cointegration vector at the variable level and the\nshort-term adjustment mechanism of the initial variable differences. Notably,\nvarious scholarly works, including Ho (2002), posit that this common factor\nconstraint could be the underpinning rationale for repudiating the null\nhypothesis, particularly in scenarios where cointegration has a strong\ntheoretical foundation. Westerlund (2006) introduced a quartet of panel\ncointegration tests (G_t, G_a, P_t, and P_a), which foreground structural\ndynamics over mere residuals. The advantage of these tests is that they\nobviate the need for common asymptotic constraints. The main thrust of these\ntests is to validate the null hypothesis of non-cointegration by postulating\nthat the error correction term in the panel\u2019s conditional error correction\nmodel remains null. Each test adheres to a normal distribution and boasts\nflexibility, allowing for unit-specific trends, varied slope parameters,\ndistinct short-term dynamics for each unit, and the inclusion of cross-\nsectional dependencies. Significantly, these tests yield robust p-values,\nadjusted for cross-sectional dependence via bootstrapping. Collectively, they\nbolster the counter-hypothesis that cointegration is present in at least one\nexamined unit.\n\n$${{G}}_{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} =\n\\frac{\\sum\\nolimits_{{{i}}=1}^{N}\\frac{\\check{{\\rm{a}}}}{{\\rm{se}}(\\check{{\\rm{a}}}_{\\rm{i}})}}{{{N}}}.$$\n\n(13)\n\n$${{G}}_{{{\\mathrm{a}}}} = \\frac{\\mathop {\\sum}\\nolimits_{{{i}} = 1}^{{N}}\n\\frac{{\\mathrm{T}}\\check{{\\rm{a}}}_{{\\mathrm{i}}}}{\\check{{\\mathrm{a}}}_1(1)}}{{{N}}}.$$\n\n(14)\n\n$${P}_{{\\mathrm{t}}} =\n\\frac{\\check{{\\mathrm{a}}}}{{\\mathrm{se}}\\left(\\check{{\\mathrm{a}}}\\right)}.$$\n\n(15)\n\n$${{P}}_{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} = T\\check{{\\mathrm{a}}}.$$\n\n(16)\n\nPersyn and Westerlund (2008) made a significant advancement in the study of\npanel cointegration by proposing an alternative hypothesis. They argued that\ncointegration extends beyond isolated instances in individual panel units and\nis actually a widespread phenomenon affecting the entire panel. This broader\napproach emphasizes the need to examine cointegration not just at an\nindividual unit level but across the entire panel, recognizing the\ninterconnectedness of all units. Their work highlights the complexities of\npanel data studies and the importance of a comprehensive evaluation of\ncointegration dynamics.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### Cross-sectional dependence test\n\nIn our research, we have chosen to employ advanced second-generation panel\nunit root tests, renowned for effectively handling cross-sectional dependence.\nThese tests assume a null hypothesis of cross-sectional independence among\nunits. The test statistics are expected to follow a standard normal\ndistribution with zero mean and a variance of one. Scholars like Smith et al.\n(2004) and Pesaran (2007) have significantly contributed to the development\nand refinement of these tests, bolstering their reliability. Our goal in using\nthese tests is to rigorously confirm the stationarity of each variable in our\ndataset, providing a solid statistical base for further analysis. We have\nmeticulously compiled the results of these tests, which are available in Table\n3.\n\nTable 3 Results of cross-sectional dependence test.\n\nFull size table\n\nTable 3 reveals a consistent rejection of the null hypothesis across all\nvariables at a 1% significance level, a finding that holds true for various\nlag lengths ranging from 1 to 6. This result indicates a strong presence of\ncross-sectional dependence among the countries in our study, likely due to\ntheir complex economic interconnections. Given this scenario, it\u2019s essential\nto use panel unit root tests that can adequately capture such cross-sectional\ndependencies. Scholars like Smith et al. (2004) and Pesaran (2007) have\nsignificantly contributed to this field by developing tests suited for these\ncomplexities. Building on these insights, Table 4 further details the outcomes\nof using these advanced panel unit root tests, specifically designed to\naddress cross-sectional dependence.\n\nTable 4 Results of unit root test.\n\nFull size table\n\nTable 4 presents the results that shed light on the integration\ncharacteristics of the five key variables central to our study. These\nvariables each exhibit first-order integration at a significance level of 1%,\nindicating their stationarity when considering their first-order differences.\nThis confirmation holds significant importance as we delve into advanced\nanalytical techniques, such as panel vector auto-regression. The outcomes of\nthese panel unit root tests unequivocally reveal the presence of cross-\nsectional dependence, coupled with first-order integration, among the five\nvariables under scrutiny. Understanding these characteristics forms the basis\nfor our subsequent academic exploration, which aims to uncover potential long-\nterm relationships interwoven among these variables. To delve deeper into this\ninquiry and either confirm or refute our hypothesized relationships, we\nleverage Westerlund\u2019s (2006) cointegration test, specifically designed for\npanels with interdependent units. This test operates within the context of a\nnull hypothesis that asserts the absence of cointegration and an alternative\nhypothesis suggesting its presence. The results of this analytical\ninvestigation are presented comprehensively in Table 5.\n\nTable 5 Results of cointegration test.\n\nFull size table\n\nTable 5 provides insights into the results obtained from the cointegration\nanalysis. Upon careful examination of the variables presented, it becomes\nevident that all the tests consistently support the null hypothesis. This\nobservation implies a lack of enduring relationships among the key variables\nunder study, namely artificial intelligence, religion, labor input, capital\ninput, and economic development. In light of this finding, in order to gain a\nmore nuanced understanding of the interconnections among these variables, we\nwill work with their first-order difference forms. Following this initial\nexploration, our analytical framework will further employ panel vector auto-\nregression methodologies to delve deeper into the empirical correlations and\npotential causal relationships.\n\n### PVAR estimation\n\nIn this section, we delve into the interrelationships among artificial\nintelligence, religion, labor input, capital input, and economic growth using\nthe panel vector auto-regression tool. The empirical results obtained from the\nPVAR (1) estimation, along with the coefficients from the Generalized Method\nof Moments (GMM), are presented in Table 6, providing a comprehensive overview\nfor detailed examination and further discussion.\n\nTable 6 Results of PVAR (1) estimation.\n\nFull size table\n\nBased on the empirical evidence presented in Table 6, a noticeable positive\ncorrelation emerges between artificial intelligence and religious freedom\nconcerning economic expansion. Furthermore, an analysis of the same dataset\nreveals that both labor and capital inputs exhibit a conducive relationship\nwith economic growth. Such findings highlight the potential synergistic roles\nof technological innovation, societal freedoms, and traditional economic\ndrivers in fostering growth dynamics.\n\n### Causality test\n\nTo further explore the causal relationships among the mentioned variables,\nthis study utilizes the Toda-Yamamoto conditional Granger causality test.\nDetermining the direction of causality is crucial, as it informs strategic\ndecision-making processes related to artificial intelligence, religious\nfreedom, labor and capital inputs, and overall economic growth trajectories.\nThe Toda-Yamamoto approach is based on a vector auto-regressive model with a\nlag of p, supported by a modified Wald test statistic that effectively\nidentifies the direction of causality among the focal variables. Importantly,\nthis methodology offers a significant advantage over the Pairwise Granger\ncausality technique, which requires that all examined variables be integrated\nof order I(0) or I(1). One of the notable strengths of the Toda-Yamamoto\nGranger causality framework is its adaptability; it can be easily applied and\nyield robust insights when the variables under consideration adhere to I(0) or\nI(1) integration. Originating from the work of Toda and Yamamoto (1995), this\ntechnique is rooted in the vector auto-regressive distributed lag model, as\ndelineated below:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n{{{{\\mathrm{ai}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}} \\\\\\\n{{{{\\mathrm{rf}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}} \\\\\\\n{{{{\\mathrm{eg}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}} \\\\\\\n{{{{\\mathrm{li}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}} \\\\\\\n{{{{\\mathrm{ci}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}} \\end{array} \\right] =\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} {{a}} \\\\\\ {{b}} \\\\\\ {{c}} \\\\\\ {{d}} \\\\\\ {{e}}\n\\end{array} \\right] + \\mathop {\\sum}\\limits_{{{t}} =\n{{{\\mathrm{l}}}}}^{{{\\mathrm{n}}}} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc} {{\\lambda\n}}_{11{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda }}_{12{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda\n}}_{13{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda }}_{14{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda\n}}_{15{\\mathrm{l}}} \\\\\\ {{\\lambda }}_{21{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda\n}}_{22{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda }}_{23{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda\n}}_{24{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda }}_{25{\\mathrm{l}}} \\\\\\ {{\\lambda\n}}_{31{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda }}_{32{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda\n}}_{33{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda }}_{34{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda\n}}_{35{\\mathrm{l}}} \\\\\\ {{\\lambda }}_{41{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda\n}}_{42{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda }}_{43{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda\n}}_{44{\\mathrm{l}}} & {{\\lambda }}_{45{\\mathrm{l}}} \\\\\\ {{\\lambda }}_{51} &\n{{\\lambda}_{52}} & {{\\lambda}_{53}} & {{\\lambda}_{54}} &\n{{\\lambda}_{55}}\\end{array} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\begin{array}{c}\n{{{\\mathrm{ai}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} - {{{\\mathrm{l}}}}} \\\\\\\n{{{{\\mathrm{rf}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} - {{{\\mathrm{l}}}}}} \\\\\\\n{{{{\\mathrm{eg}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} - {{{\\mathrm{l}}}}}} \\\\\\\n{{{{\\mathrm{li}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} - {{{\\mathrm{l}}}}}} \\\\\\\n{{{{\\mathrm{ci}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} - {{{\\mathrm{l}}}}}}\n\\end{array} \\right] \\\\\\ + \\mathop {\\sum}\\limits_{{{j}} = {{p}} +\n1}^{{{m}}_{{{{\\max}}}}} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc} {\\lambda }_{11{\\mathrm{j}}}\n& {\\lambda }_{12{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\lambda }_{13{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\lambda\n}_{14{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\lambda }_{15{\\mathrm{j}}} \\\\\\ {\\lambda\n}_{21{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\lambda }_{22{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\lambda }_{23{\\mathrm{j}}}\n& {\\lambda }_{24{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\lambda }_{25{\\mathrm{j}}} \\\\\\ {\\lambda\n}_{31{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\lambda }_{32{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\lambda }_{33{\\mathrm{j}}}\n& {\\lambda }_{34{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\lambda }_{35{\\mathrm{j}}} \\\\\\ {\\lambda\n}_{41{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\lambda }_{42{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\lambda }_{43{\\mathrm{j}}}\n& {\\lambda }_{44{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\uplambda }_{45{\\mathrm{j}}} \\\\\\ {\\uplambda\n}_{51{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\lambda }_{52{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\lambda }_{53{\\mathrm{j}}}\n& {\\lambda }_{54{\\mathrm{j}}} & {\\lambda }_{55{\\mathrm{j}}} \\end{array}\\right]\n\\times \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n{{{\\mathrm{ai}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} - {\\mathrm{j}}} \\\\\\\n{{{{\\mathrm{rf}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} - {\\mathrm{j}}}} \\\\\\\n{{{{\\mathrm{eg}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} - {\\mathrm{j}}}} \\\\\\\n{{{{\\mathrm{li}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} - {\\mathrm{j}}}} \\\\\\\n{{{{\\mathrm{ci}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}} - {\\mathrm{j}}}}\n\\end{array}\\right] + \\left[ \\begin{array}{c}1\\epsilon\n_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} \\\\\\ 2\\epsilon\n_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} \\\\\\ 3\\epsilon\n_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} \\\\\\ 4\\epsilon\n_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} \\\\\\ 5\\epsilon\n_{{{{\\mathrm{i}}}},{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}} \\end{array}\\right]\\end{array} .$$\n\n(17)\n\nIn Eq. (17), n represents the order of the vector auto-regressive process,\naugmented with m supplementary lags of m_max. Here, m_max typifies the highest\ndegree of integration within the vector auto-regressive system. The Wald test\nstatistic\u2019s asymptotic \u03c7^2 distribution is discerned within the context of a\nvector auto-regressive model of order n + m_max. This mathematical construct\naids in empirically validating the propositions under the Toda-Yamamoto\nGranger causality framework. The postulated null hypothesis symbolized as\n\u03bb_15l \u2260 0 for V_l, posits a causal interplay between the duo of assessed\nvariables. This is indicative of one variable possessing predictive power over\nthe other. In contrast, the alternative hypothesis, articulated as \u03bb_15l = 0\nfor V_l, negates such a causal linkage, suggesting that the two variables\nevolve independently without influencing each other\u2019s trajectories. Drawing\nfrom the aforementioned methodological exposition, we proceeded to implement\nthe Toda-Yamamoto causality test to further elucidate the causal relationship\namong artificial intelligence, religious freedom, labor and capital inputs,\nand economic growth under scrutiny. The empirical outcomes of this analysis\nare systematically tabulated and presented in Table 7 for evaluation.\n\nTable 7 Results of causality test.\n\nFull size table\n\nBased on the results presented in Table 7, a clear causal relationship emerges\namong artificial intelligence, religious freedom, labor input, and capital\ninput. This causal interplay aligns with existing literature (Dahlum et al.,\n2022; Mokyr et al., 2015; Grim 2015) that posits the intricate interconnection\nof technology, societal freedoms, and economic factors in driving growth and\ndevelopment. For example, previous scholarly investigations have highlighted\nthe role of technological advancements, such as artificial intelligence, in\nshaping economic trajectories. Simultaneously, the freedom of religious\nexpression has been associated with societal stability and, consequently,\nfavorable economic environments. The observed causal dynamics among these\nvariables in our findings further emphasize the multifaceted nature of their\ninterrelation, underscoring the importance of a holistic approach when\nanalyzing the determinants of economic growth.\n\n### Impulse response function\n\nIn this section, we conduct a comprehensive examination of impulse response\nfunctions and their significance in academic discourse. A fundamental\nrequirement for conducting the impulse response function analysis is the\ncareful arrangement of variables in a relevant sequence. In an effort to\northogonalize shocks, this study employs Cholesky\u2019s decomposition method on\nthe variance-covariance residual matrix within the framework of the panel\nvector auto-regression model, drawing inspiration from the pioneering work of\nSims\u2019s (1980). Sims proposed the idea that leading variables, even in their\nlagged form, tend to exhibit higher exogeneity. Conversely, subsequent\nvariables are susceptible to simultaneous changes, making them inherently\nendogenous. Additionally, earlier variables are typically influenced by a one-\nperiod lag. Guided by this theoretical framework, our research adopts a\nsequence comprising artificial intelligence, religion, labor input, capital\ninput, and economic growth. The results of the impulse response function\nanalyses are visually presented in Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 1: Results of impulse response function analysis.\n\nReaction of religion and economic growth to religious freedom, artificial\nintelligence, labor input, and capital input one-standard deviation shock.\n\nFull size image\n\nIn the process of empirical examination, we adhered to the sequential\narrangement of variables used within the panel vector auto-regression when\nconducting the impulse response function estimations. The results, as depicted\nin Fig. 1, illustrate the systemic evolution resulting from a one-standard-\ndeviation shock over a decade. An analysis of the dataset reveals that a one-\nstandard-deviation shock in artificial intelligence leads to a discernible and\nstatistically significant increase in economic growth. This relationship finds\nsupport in various academic contributions and theoretical postulates. Acemoglu\nand Restrepo (2018) proposed that technological advancements driven by\nartificial intelligence could lead to increased productivity, attributed to\nimproved resource allocation and enhanced operational capabilities.\nBrynjolfsson and McAfee\u2019s (2014) work on the \u2018Second Machine Age\u2019 suggested\nthat artificial intelligence, at the intersection of emerging digital\nparadigms, had the potential to drive economic expansion by fostering\ninnovative business ecosystems and markets. Complementing this perspective,\nBughin et al. (2017) highlighted the transformative potential of artificial\nintelligence as a new production catalyst, working synergistically with labor\nand capital to create unprecedented economic value.\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, Aghion et al. (2017) also offered insights into\nthe multifaceted growth implications of artificial intelligence, emphasizing\nits ability to stimulate R&D efforts, drive innovation diffusion, and reshape\ncompetitive market dynamics. Furthermore, from a theoretical perspective,\nendogenous growth theory highlights the fundamental role of technological\nadvancements, with artificial intelligence playing a pivotal role, in shaping\nlong-term growth trajectories. Schumpeter\u2019s concept of creative destruction\nsuggests that emerging technologies like artificial intelligence may render\nobsolete existing processes but also pave the way for new growth-oriented\nventures. Additionally, the theory of human capital augmentation posits a\nharmonious symbiosis between artificial intelligence and human roles. In this\nview, artificial intelligence serves as an enhancer rather than a substitute\nfor human functions, amplifying productivity and, consequently, promoting\ngrowth. Given this comprehensive amalgamation of academic discussions and\ntheoretical frameworks, the strong positive correlation between artificial\nintelligence-induced perturbations and economic growth becomes evident.\n\nThe outcomes depicted in Fig. 1 shed light on an association suggesting that\neconomic advancement experiences a notable and statistically significant\nupswing in response to perturbations originating from religious freedom. This\nsymbiotic relationship between religious liberty and economic prosperity has\nsparked scholarly interest and merits comprehensive exploration. At the\nforefront of this discourse, McCleary and Barro (2003) presented empirical\nevidence suggesting that religious beliefs and practices could significantly\nshape economic behaviors and outcomes. They argued that specific religious\ntenets could foster a strong work ethic, strengthen societal trust, and reduce\ntransactional impediments, thereby catalyzing economic vitality. Building upon\nthis foundation, Guiso et al. (2003) systematically examined the interplay\nbetween religious values and socioeconomic indicators, concluding that\nreligious doctrines emphasizing individual agency were positively correlated\nwith economic growth.\n\nOffering a historical perspective, Becker and Woessmann (2009) highlighted how\nProtestant regions in Europe exhibited higher literacy rates, which in turn\ninfluenced superior economic trajectories. From an institutional standpoint,\nStulz and Williamson (2003) posited that religious convictions could shape and\nrefine the framework of economic, judicial, and political institutions in ways\nthat bolstered economic dynamism. Lastly, Iannaccone (1998) introduced a novel\nperspective by theorizing that religious freedom, by stimulating healthy\ncompetition among religious factions, could drive innovation and operational\nefficiencies, resembling the principles of competitive markets and indirectly\npromoting economic growth. Theoretically, the cultural economics framework\noutlined by Molle (2019) suggests that religious freedom, as an integral\naspect of cultural diversity, can enhance economic growth by stimulating\ncreativity, innovation, and adaptive agility. Furthermore, the principles of\ninstitutional economics, rooted in Mayer\u2019s (2018) scholarship, underscore the\ncrucial role of institutions, including religious ones, in shaping economic\ntrajectories. By ensuring religious pluralism and preventing monolithic\nreligious hegemonies, religious freedom potentially contributes to an\ninstitutionally rich environment that fosters economic vitality.\n\nIn the concluding observations presented in Fig. 1, it is evident that\neconomic expansion exhibits a pronounced and statistically significant\nincrease following perturbations attributed to both labor and capital inputs.\nThis fundamental interrelationship, deeply rooted in the annals of economic\nthought, warrants a comprehensive analytical examination supported by\ncontemporary scholarly contributions. Solow (1956) emerged as a luminary in\nthis discourse, with his seminal exposition positing that labor and capital,\nas the principal factors of production, formed the foundation for sustained\neconomic growth. His model emphasized that changes or additions in these\ninputs would inevitably translate into fluctuations in economic output.\nBuilding upon this foundational paradigm, Romer (1986) introduced an\nendogenous perspective, elucidating how capital accumulation, particularly in\nthe context of human capital, could yield increasing returns, thereby\naccelerating economic growth. From a theoretical standpoint, the classical\ntheory of production, with its roots tracing back to figures, underscores the\npivotal roles of labor and capital as the twin engines propelling the\nmachinery of economic development. It argues that variations in these inputs\ncorrespondingly affect aggregate economic outcomes. In a more contemporary\nconceptualization, the endogenous growth theory asserts that internal factors\nsuch as labor productivity and capital deepening, especially in knowledge-\nintensive economies, can intrinsically guide the course of long-term economic\ngrowth. This theory emphasizes that shocks in labor and capital not only\ninfluence the contemporary economic state but also lay the groundwork for\nfuture growth trajectories by impacting innovation and technological progress.\n\n### Variance decomposition\n\nImpulse response function analyses, widely acclaimed in the economic\nliterature, serve as pivotal tools for discerning the dynamic reactions of one\nvariable in response to unanticipated shocks in another. However, an intrinsic\nshortcoming of these methodologies is their inability to quantify the exact\nmagnitude and duration of such propagating influences. To bridge this\nepistemic gap, scholars often resort to variance decomposition techniques.\nThis approach delineates the fraction of forecast-error variance of a given\ndependent series that can be attributed to its own innovations, in\njuxtaposition to those engendered by other exogenous determinants. Table 8\nencapsulates the results derived from the variance decomposition analysis,\nleveraging the coefficient matrices of orthogonalized impulse responses. This\nexamination provides an intricate comprehension of the multifaceted\ninteractions and dependencies among the variables under consideration.\n\nTable 8 Results of forecast-error variance decomposition (%).\n\nFull size table\n\nTable 8 presents the forecast-error variance decompositions stemming from the\nfoundational PVAR model, delineated at intervals of 5, 10, 15, and 20 periods.\nUpon close examination, it is discernible that the variance in economic growth\ncan be attributed, in part, to several determinants. Specifically, artificial\nintelligence accounts for an estimated 3.052% of the overall variance in\neconomic growth, while religious freedom contributes to approximately 2.267%.\nNotably, labor and capital inputs emerge as the paramount factors, commanding\na substantial share in elucidating the total variance in economic growth.\nIntriguingly, the findings also hint at a prospective trend: over extended\nperiods, the influence of artificial intelligence and religious freedom on\neconomic growth appears poised to gain greater prominence and significance.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn light of the endeavor undertaken in this article, we have delved deeply\ninto the intricate dynamics of artificial intelligence and religious freedom\nas catalysts for economic growth, spanning 26 countries over the period\n2000\u20132021. By applying the panel vector auto-regression model, the results\nreveal a definitive positive correlation between artificial intelligence,\nreligious freedom, and the dynamics of economic growth. The analytical depth\nprovided by the forecast-error variance decomposition further elucidates the\nescalating prominence of these variables, forecasting their augmented\ninfluence on future economic development trajectories. Concurrently, the\nenduring significance of traditional determinants, notably labor and capital\ninputs, in the economic growth narrative remains unassailable, as confirmed by\nthis study. The validation brought forth by the Toda-Yamamoto Granger\ncausality analysis further accentuates the robustness and credibility of the\nfindings expounded in this article. Collectively, this study not only\nreaffirms established paradigms but also sheds light on emerging dynamics,\noffering pivotal insights for stakeholders in the economic and policy arenas.\n\nBased on the insights gleaned from this research, several concrete policy\nimplications emerge that could inform decision-making in the realms of\nartificial intelligence, religion, and economic growth. First, given the\ndiscernible positive correlation between artificial intelligence and economic\ngrowth, it is imperative for policymakers to prioritize the integration of\nartificial intelligence-driven methodologies across key sectors of the\neconomy. This entails not only investing in artificial intelligence research\nand development but also fostering an environment conducive to artificial\nintelligence adoption through appropriate educational reforms, skill\ndevelopment programs, and regulatory frameworks. A nation\u2019s strategic emphasis\non artificial intelligence readiness can potentially position it at the\nforefront of the next wave of global economic leaders. Second, the study\naccentuates the often overlooked economic dividends of religious freedom.\nPolicymakers should be cognizant of the economic benefits that can be reaped\nfrom ensuring and promoting religious freedom. This extends beyond mere\ntolerance and requires proactive measures to foster interfaith dialog, remove\ndiscriminatory regulations, and champion religious pluralism. Such an\ninclusive approach can catalyze social cohesion, reduce conflicts, and, in\nturn, provide a stable environment conducive to economic activities and\nforeign investments. Finally, while emergent factors like artificial\nintelligence and religious freedom are gaining traction, the unassailable\nsignificance of traditional determinants such as labor and capital cannot be\nsidelined. It remains vital for policymakers to continuously refine and\nbolster policies related to labor markets, workforce training, and capital\ninvestments. Ensuring the fluidity and efficiency of these foundational\neconomic elements, in tandem with new growth catalysts, will ensure a holistic\nand sustainable economic development trajectory for nations.\n\nBased on the findings of this study, several limitations and potential avenues\nfor future research can be identified: 1 Limitations: (1) The small sample\nsize, which consists of only 26 countries, may limit the generalizability of\nthe findings across different cultural, religious, and economic contexts. (2)\nThe panel vector auto-regression model, while useful, may not fully capture\nthe complex, non-linear relationships between artificial intelligence,\nreligion, and economic growth. (3) The study\u2019s focus on aggregate measures of\nartificial intelligence, religion, and economic growth may obscure important\nnuances and variations within each of these domains. (4) The investigation\ndoes not consider potential moderating factors, such as political or social\nvariables, that could influence the relationships between artificial\nintelligence, religion, and economic growth. 2 Future research directions: (1)\nexpanding the sample size and diversity of countries to provide a more\ncomprehensive and globally representative understanding of the relationships\nbetween artificial intelligence, religion, and economic growth (2) conducting\nlongitudinal studies that extend the time frame of the analysis to capture the\nongoing evolution of artificial intelligence and its potential impacts on\nreligion and economic growth. (3) Employing alternative methodological\napproaches, such as machine learning or network analysis, to better capture\nthe intricate and dynamic interplay between artificial intelligence, religion,\nand economic growth (4) Examining sub-domains within artificial intelligence,\nreligion, and economic growth, as well as potential interactions between these\nsub-domains, to gain deeper insights into their specific relationships and\nmechanisms of influence. (5) Investigating the role of moderating factors,\nsuch as political, social, or cultural variables, in shaping the relationships\nbetween artificial intelligence, religion, and economic growth could help\nidentify context-specific policy implications. These limitations and future\nresearch directions serve to further advance the understanding of the complex\nrelationships between artificial intelligence, religion, and economic growth\nwhile also encouraging the development of more nuanced, context-sensitive, and\nactionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this\npublished article\n\n## References\n\n  * Abbas Q, Nurunnabi M, Alfakhri Y, Khan W, Hussain A, Iqbal W (2020) The role of fixed capital formation, renewable and non-renewable energy in economic growth and carbon emission: a case study of belt and road initiative project.
