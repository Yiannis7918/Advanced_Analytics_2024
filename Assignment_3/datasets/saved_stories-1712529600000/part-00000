WS Studio\n1985\n\nStanford Medicine researchers have found that large language models can help\ndraft responses to patient portal messages, reducing health care providers\u2019\nworkload and alleviating burnout.\n\nThe artificial intelligence-generated drafts, which are reviewed and edited by\na clinician before they are shared with the patient, help respond to clinical\ninquires, such as what to do about symptoms of a cold or side effects of a\nmedication. In a study of the AI-generated responses, clinicians reported a\nreduction in everyday clerical burden and fewer feelings of burnout.\n\nWhen the large language model GPT, which powered the draft responses, was\nintroduced in late 2022, it ignited a wave of excitement and anticipation\nabout the potential of artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cIt got everyone in medicine thinking, \u2018Hey this tool is so great at creating\nlanguage, how could it be useful to us?\u2019\u201d said Patricia Garcia, MD, clinical\nassociate professor of medicine and the associate chief medical information\nofficer at Stanford Health Care. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long for folks to think about\nwriting messages, summaries, clinical notes \u2014 we all saw a lot of potential\nfor anything that involves language content generation.\u201d\n\nThis is an early demonstration of how integrating generative AI into health\ncare workflows with a \u201chuman in the loop\u201d can assist providers, said Michael\nPfeffer, MD, Stanford Health Care\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cWe\u2019re always\ntrying to find ways to have the electronic health record work with clinicians\nthrough automation. Already, clinicians are noting a reduction in cognitive\nburden \u2014 and the AI is only going to improve from here.\u201d\n\nA paper detailing the study published in JAMA Network Open on March 20. Garcia\nand Stephen Ma, MD, PhD, clinical informatics fellow, led the research,\nsupported by the Stanford Department of Medicine and Stanford Technology and\nDigital Solutions team.\n\n\u201cWhile multiple published studies show potential promise for generative AI in\nhealth care, this is among the first clinical use to be rigorously evaluated \u2014\nwhich is critical to assess real-world safety and usefulness,\u201d said\nChristopher Sharp, MD, chief medical information officer at Stanford Medicine\nand the senior author of the study.\n\nStanford Medicine has been incorporating various AI tools into health care\nwhile ensuring patient safety and privacy, with guidance from the RAISE Health\ninitiative.\n\n### Code-to-bedside medicine\n\nGarcia and the team evaluated the responses generated by the large language\nmodel, which is integrated into electronic health records and complies with\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.\n\nUpon receipt of a message, the model generated a draft response to the\npatient\u2019s message within seconds. Integration with the electronic health\nrecord allowed the draft responses to appear in the clinician\u2019s inbox, where\nthey could seamlessly review them, make any necessary edits and send the final\nresponse back to the patient. The responses were generated over the course of\nfive weeks in July and August 2023 on behalf of 162 primary care and\ngastroenterology clinicians.\n\n> This was a serendipitous alignment where an amazing new technology came to\n> fruition during a time when we needed a different, innovative solution.\n\nStanford Medicine is one of the first to publish about their experience using\na large language model to generate draft responses for patient messages and to\nenable the use of such a tool by a broader care team that includes nurses,\nadvanced practice clinician and pharmacists.\n\n\u201cWe know that in-basket messaging and responding to patients is a team sport,\u201d\nGarcia said. \u201cI think what makes this study particularly impactful is that\nit\u2019s capturing what it\u2019s like to deploy this tool in a way that would be\npractical and reflective of a real care environment.\u201d She noted that it\u2019s not\njust doctors who respond to patients \u2014 nurses, advanced practice clinician and\npharmacists all work collectively to answer patient messages.\n\n### Alleviating burden\n\nAfter the pilot period, Garcia and the team issued a survey to the clinicians,\nasking them to report on their experience. They reported that the AI-generated\ndrafts lightened the cognitive load of responding to patient messages and\nimproved their feelings of work exhaustion despite objective findings that the\ndrafts did not save the clinicians\u2019 time. That\u2019s still a win, Garcia said, as\nthis tool is likely to have even broader applicability and impact as it\nevolves.\n\n\u201cWe know that clinicians and care teams have been under a lot of pressure,\neven before the pandemic, and health care just hasn\u2019t been able to find a good\nsolution for burnout,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThis was a serendipitous alignment where\nan amazing new technology came to fruition during a time when we needed a\ndifferent, innovative solution. We\u2019re already seeing a positive impact on\nrelieving burden, and I think it\u2019s just going to get more effective as we\ncontinue to iterate.\u201d\n\nGarcia added that Stanford Health Care is planning to expand the use of this\ntool to additional clinicians in the coming months.\n\nFor more news about responsible AI in health and medicine, sign up for the\nRAISE Health newsletter.\n\nRegister for the RAISE Health Symposium on May 14.\n\n  * Hanae Armitage\n\nHanae Armitage is a science writer in the Office of Communications.
