Schwarzman\nCollege of Computing recently opened the doors to its new headquarters in\nBuilding 45. The building\u2019s central location and welcoming design will help\nform a new cluster of connectivity at MIT and enable the space to have a\nmultifaceted role.\n\n\u201cThe college has a broad mandate for computing across MIT,\u201d says Daniel\nHuttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and the Henry\nEllis Warren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. \u201cThe\nbuilding is designed to be the computing crossroads of the campus. It\u2019s a\nplace to bring a mix of people together to connect, engage, and catalyze\ncollaborations in computing, and a home to a related set of computing research\ngroups from multiple departments and labs.\u201d\n\n\u201cComputing is the defining technology of our time and it will continue to be,\nwell into the future,\u201d says MIT President Sally Kornbluth. \u201cAs the people of\nMIT make progress in high-impact fields from AI to climate, this fantastic new\nbuilding will enable collaboration across computing, engineering, biological\nscience, economics, and countless other fields, encouraging the cross-\npollination of ideas that inspires us to generate fresh solutions. The college\nhas opened its doors at just the right time.\u201d\n\nA physical embodiment\n\nAn approximately 178,000 square foot eight-floor structure, the building is\ndesigned to be a physical embodiment of the MIT Schwarzman College of\nComputing\u2019s three-fold mission: strengthen core computer science and\nartificial intelligence; infuse the forefront of computing with disciplines\nacross MIT; and advance social, ethical, and policy dimensions of computing.\n\nOriented for the campus community and the public to come in and engage with\nthe college, the first two floors of the building encompass multiple convening\nareas, including a 60-seat classroom, a 250-seat lecture hall, and an\nassortment of spaces for studying and social interactions.\n\nAcademic activity has commenced in both the lecture hall and classroom this\nsemester with 13 classes for undergraduate and graduate students. Subjects\ninclude 6.C35/6.C85 (Interactive Data Visualization and Society), a class\ntaught by faculty from the departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer\nScience (EECS) and Urban Studies and Planning. The class was created as part\nof the Common Ground for Computing Education, a cross-cutting initiative of\nthe college that brings multiple departments together to develop and teach new\ncourses and launch new programs that blend computing with other disciplines.\n\n\u201cThe new college building is catering not only to educational and research\nneeds, but also fostering extensive community connections. It has been\nparticularly exciting to see faculty teaching classes in the building and the\nlobby bustling with students on any given day, engrossed in their studies or\njust enjoying the space while taking a break,\u201d says Asu Ozdaglar, deputy dean\nof the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and head of EECS.\n\nThe building will also accommodate 50 computing research groups, which\ncorrespond to the number of new faculty the college is hiring \u2014 25 in core\ncomputing positions and 25 in shared positions with departments at MIT. These\ngroups bring together a mix of new and existing teams in related research\nareas spanning floors four through seven of the building.\n\nIn mid-January, the initial two dozen research groups moved into the building,\nincluding faculty from the departments of EECS; Aeronautics and Astronautics;\nBrain and Cognitive Sciences; Mechanical Engineering; and Economics who are\naffiliated with the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory\nand the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems. The research groups\nform a coherent overall cluster in deep learning and generative AI, natural\nlanguage processing, computer vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, game\ntheoretic methods, and societal impact of AI.\n\nMore will follow suit, including some of the 10 faculty who have been hired\ninto shared positions by the college with the departments of Brain and\nCognitive Sciences; Chemical Engineering; Comparative Media Studies and\nWriting; Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences; Music and Theater Arts;\nMechanical Engineering; Nuclear Science and Engineering; Political Science;\nand the MIT Sloan School of Management.\n\n\u201cI eagerly anticipate the building's expansion of opportunities, facilitating\nthe development of even deeper connections the college has made so far\nspanning all five schools,\" says Anantha Chandrakasan, chief innovation and\nstrategy officer, dean of the School of Engineering, and the Vannevar Bush\nProfessor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.\n\nOther college programs and activities that are being supported in the building\ninclude the MIT Quest for Intelligence, Center for Computational Science and\nEngineering, and MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. There are also dedicated areas for the\ndean\u2019s office, as well as for the cross-cutting areas of the college \u2014 the\nSocial and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing, Common Ground, and Special\nSemester Topics in Computing, a new experimental program designed to bring MIT\nresearchers and visitors together in a common space for a semester around\nareas of interest.\n\nAdditional spaces include conference rooms on the third floor that are\navailable for use by any college unit. These rooms are accessible to both\nresidents and nonresidents of the building to host weekly group meetings or\nother computing-related activities.\n\nFor the MIT community at large, the building\u2019s main event space, along with\nthree conference rooms, is available for meetings, events, and conferences.\nLocated eight stories high on the top floor with striking views across\nCambridge and Boston and of the Great Dome, the event space is already in\ndemand with bookings through next fall, and has quickly become a popular\ndestination on campus.\n\nThe college inaugurated the event space over the January Independent\nActivities Period, welcoming students, faculty, and visitors to the building\nfor Expanding Horizons in Computing \u2014 a weeklong series of bootcamps,\nworkshops, short talks, panels, and roundtable discussions. Organized by\nvarious MIT faculty, the 12 sessions in the series delved into exciting areas\nof computing and AI, with topics ranging from security, intelligence, and deep\nlearning to design, sustainability, and policy.\n\nForm and function\n\nDesigned by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the state-of-the-art space for\neducation, research, and collaboration took shape over four years of design\nand construction.\n\n\u201cIn the design of a new multifunctional building like this, I view my job as\nthe dean being to make sure that the building fulfills the functional needs of\nthe college mission,\u201d says Huttenlocher. \u201cI think what has been most rewarding\nfor me, now that the building is finished, is to see its form supporting its\nwide range of intended functions.\u201d\n\nIn keeping with MIT\u2019s commitment to environmental sustainability, the building\nis designed to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold\ncertification. The final review with the U.S. Green Building Council is\ntracking toward a Platinum certification.\n\nThe glass shingles on the building\u2019s south-facing side serve a dual purpose in\nthat they allow abundant natural light in and form a double-skin fa\u00e7ade\nconstructed of interlocking units that create a deep sealed cavity, which is\nanticipated to notably lower energy consumption.\n\nOther sustainability features include embodied carbon tracking, on-site\nstormwater management, fixtures that reduce indoor potable water usage, and a\nlarge green roof. The building is also the first to utilize heat from a newly\ncompleted utilities plant built on top of Building 42, which converted\nconventional steam-based distributed systems into more efficient hot-water\nsystems. This conversion significantly enhances the building\u2019s capacity to\ndeliver more efficient medium-temperature hot water across the entire\nfacility.\n\nGrand unveiling\n\nA dedication ceremony for the building is planned for the spring.\n\nThe momentous event will mark the official completion and opening of the new\nbuilding and celebrate the culmination of hard work, commitment, and\ncollaboration in bringing it to fruition.\n\nIt will also celebrate the 2018 foundational gift that established the college\nfrom Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chair, CEO, and co-founder of Blackstone, the\nglobal asset management and financial services firm. In addition, it will\nacknowledge Sebastian Man \u201979, SM \u201980, the first donor to support the building\nafter Schwarzman. Man\u2019s gift will be recognized with the naming of a key space\nin the building that will enrich the academic and research activities of the\nMIT Schwarzman College of Computing and the Institute.\n\n### Share this news article on:\n\n  * X\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * Print\n\n## Related Links\n\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Campus buildings and architecture\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n  * School of Architecture and Planning\n  * School of Engineering\n  * School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences\n  * School of Science\n  * MIT Sloan School of Management\n  * Aeronautical and astronautical engineering\n  * Brain and cognitive sciences\n  * Chemical engineering\n  * Comparative Media Studies/Writing\n  * EAPS\n  * Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (eecs)\n  * Music and theater arts\n  * Nuclear science and engineering\n  * Political science\n  * Urban studies and planning\n  * Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)\n  * Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)\n  * MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab\n  * Quest for Intelligence\n  * Facilities\n  * Administration\n  * Education, teaching, academics\n  * Cambridge, Boston and region\n  * Community\n  * Computer science and technology\n  * Artificial intelligence\n  * Machine learning\n  * Technology and society\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### Design progresses for MIT Schwarzman College of Computing building on\nVassar Street\n\n### Building site identified for MIT Stephen A.
