Apr 2024 | Jan Zerebecki | CC-BY-SA-4.0\n\nIn March, the configuration for building openSUSE Factory was changed to be\nbit-by-bit reproducible (except for the embedded signature). Following this,\nthe first openSUSE Tumbleweed packages were verified to be bit-by-bit\nreproducible.\n\nThank you to everyone who helped to make this happen. This was an important\nimprovement.\n\nIt will take some time to do this verification for all packages to see how\nmany of our packages are reproducible to this detail. Previous verifications,\nwhile ignoring some differences that this fixed, succeeded for more than 95\npercent of packages.\n\n## Contribute\n\nThe effort on reproducible builds is a collaboration across many\ndistributions. See how to contribute to reproducible builds in openSUSE.\n\n## Uses\n\nReproducible builds have a multitude of uses for security and quality. To\nfurther enhance their utility, reproducible builds need to be combined with\nother techniques such as distributed post-merge code review and capability\nbased designs.\n\nA recent example is that reproducible builds allow for the creation of proof,\nsimply by rebuilding and comparing the result, that a GCC build whose source\nwas extracted with a compromised xz was not compromised; this process was\nachieved without needing to reverse engineer how the compromise occurred.\nSimilarly, reproducible builds were reported as being usefully during\ninvestigations of the xz compromise.\n\nreproducible builds enable collaboration that otherwise would not be possible\nby supporting more scientifically-based arguments for security, which can be\nindependently verified.\n\nCategories: openSUSE Tumbleweed Factory\n\nTags: openSUSE Developers Open Source Community Security Reproducible Builds\n\n##### Share this post:\n\n\u00a9 2011\u20132024 openSUSE contributors\n\nSource Code License\n\n", "frontpage": false}
