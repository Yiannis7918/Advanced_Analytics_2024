Most of those users\nprobably don\u2019t know that Google Photos' story begins at a startup called Bump\n\u2014 part of YC\u2019s Summer 2009 batch.\n\nBump was a mobile app used by more than 150M people to share photos and\ncontact info by bumping their phones together \u2014 something that, at the time,\nwas an absolute game changer. Bump was acquired by Google in 2013, and an\nunreleased photo sharing app they were building became the foundation of\nGoogle Photos.\n\nDavid Lieb, Bump\u2019s CEO and co-founder, led the product from inception all the\nway past the billion user mark. And today, after three batches as a Visiting\nGroup Partner at YC, he is our newest full time Group Partner. I\u2019m so proud to\nwelcome him.\n\nJust as mobile unlocked new ideas like Bump, today we\u2019re seeing AI unlock an\nentirely new wave of consumer companies. Google Photos might be the very first\nexample of this \u2014 a mass consumer product built with AI search, face\nrecognition, and editing at its core. Dave is an expert at knowing how to use\nAI to make something people want. Having him on your side to help navigate\nthis new world is an incredible advantage.\n\nAs an advisor, he often reminds me of PG and Jessica, who brought founders\nback to the basics again and again. He pushes founders to focus on the things\nthat matter. Who are you building this for? Not the imaginary silhouette of a\ncustomer \u2014 the real people, with names you know, that want this. And when did\nyou last talk to them? As a founder, he admits that he let himself get\ndistracted with big-name investors and app store ranking. Today, he can say\nwith authority that nothing ranks higher than your customers coming back to\nyour product again and again.\n\nWhen Dave was interviewing for YC back in 2009, PG put his head down in the\nmiddle of the interview. He looked up and asked how Bump would be bigger than\nGoogle. It was this simple question that honed Dave\u2019s focus and made his\nambitions grow. We are so thrilled Dave has come back to YC to also encourage\nfounders to think big.\n\nHear more about how Dave transformed his app into one of the biggest photo\nservices in the world on The Social Radars.\n\nCategories\n\nPartners\n\nOther Posts\n\nWelcome S22 Visiting Group Partners\n\nMay 11, 2022 by Aaron Epstein\n\nRead More\n\nTwo New YC Partners: Justin Kan and Aaron Harris\n\nMarch 19, 2014 by Sam Altman\n\nRead More\n\nWelcome back to YC, Emmett Shear and Wayne Crosby\n\nMay 11, 2023 by Aaron Epstein\n\nRead More\n\nSubscribe\n\n# Author\n\n  * ### Garry Tan\n\nGarry is the President & CEO of Y Combinator.
