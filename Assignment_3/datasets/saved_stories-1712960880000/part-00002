Known as the SpaceHopper, the bot was\nrecently put to the test on a zero-gravity aircraft flight.\n\nThe SpaceHopper program was first launched two and a half years ago, as a\nstudent research project at ETH Zurich university in Switzerland.\n\nMore Stories\n\nRobotics\n\nHow blue-collar workers will train the humanoids that take their jobs\n\nIt's aimed at addressing the challenge of efficiently exploring low-gravity\ncelestial bodies such as asteroids and moons. Not only might such bodies\ncontain much-needed substances like rare-earth metals, they could also help\nscientists better understand the formation of the universe.\n\nIn its current form, the SpaceHopper robot consists of a triangular aerospace-\naluminum body with an articulated leg at each corner. Each of those three legs\nin turn has a knee and a hip joint \u2013 two motors move the hip via a\ndifferential drive mechanism, and another motor moves the knee.\n\nBecause the triangular-bodied robot has no assigned front or rear end, it can\neasily move in any direction\n\nETH Zurich/Jorit Geurts\n\nOnboard deep-learning-based software controls the combined movements of the\nlegs, allowing the robot to perform a series of specific functions. These\nfunctions include initiating hops, keeping the bot's body correctly oriented\nwhile in flight, and performing controlled landings at predetermined\nlocations.\n\nAll nine leg motors work together to launch the SpaceHopper high off the\nasteroid's surface when jumping. As the robot is subsequently in flight, it\nmaintains its upright orientation by selectively extending or withdrawing its\nlegs to shift its center of mass as needed. Upon landing, its legs flex to\nabsorb impact and to keep the bot from falling over.\n\nInitial tests of these functions were performed in an ETH Zurich lab, where\nthe robot was attached to a counterweight and a spinning gimbal to simulate\nthe low-gravity conditions of the dwarf planet Ceres.\n\nLate last year, however, members of the student team got to take the\nSpaceHopper on an Air Zero G parabolic flight hosted by the European Space\nAgency and French company Novespace. In these kinds of flights, an Airbus A310\nairliner flies in a series of upward and downward arcs, producing short\nperiods of weightlessness within the plane as it does so.\n\nThe SpaceHopper robot flails its legs to maintain its orientation on the Air\nZero G flight\n\nNicolas Courtioux\n\nDuring the 2023 flight, the robot repeatedly jumped off the floor of the\naircraft \u2013 in a specific direction \u2013 and kept itself correctly oriented once\nairborne. Highlights of the tests can be seen in the video below.\n\nIt should be noted that an ETH Zurich team previously developed a four-legged\nasteroid-hopping robot called the SpaceBok. The SpaceHopper's three-legged\nlayout is intended to reduce size and weight as compared to that design. In\nfact, at a total weight of 5.2 kg (11.5 lb), the robot could conceivably be\ncarried in and deployed from a small unmanned CubeSat spacecraft.\n\nUsing a hopping robot for asteroid exploration\n\nSources: ETH Zurich, SpaceHopper\n\nView gallery - 4 images\n\n## Tags\n\nRoboticsETH ZurichlocomotionSpace exploration\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\nNo comments\n\nBen Coxworth\n\nBased out of Edmonton, Canada, Ben Coxworth has been writing for New Atlas\nsince 2009 and is presently Managing Editor for North America.
