Her first memories of her\nfather are vivid. As a six-year-old, Maria would visit a neighbor\u2019s apartment\nin her building when she wanted to see him. From there, she could peer through\nthe railings of a balcony into the prison below and try to catch a glimpse of\nhim through the small window of his cell, where he was locked up for opposing\nthe dictatorship of Francisco Franco.\n\nThere is no photo of Maria on that balcony. But she can now hold something\nlike it: a fake photo\u2014or memory-based reconstruction, as the Barcelona-based\ndesign studio Domestic Data Streamers puts it\u2014of the scene that a real photo\nmight have captured. The fake snapshots are blurred and distorted, but they\ncan still rewind a lifetime in an instant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to see when you\u2019ve got the memory right, because there is a\nvery visceral reaction,\u201d says Pau Garcia, founder of Domestic Data Streamers.\n\u201cIt happens every time. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh! Yes! It was like that!\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 1960s post-civil war Barcelona, 14-year-old Denia (now 73) and her family,\nnewly arrived from Alcal\u00e1 de J\u00facar, found solace and excitement in the lively\ndance hall \u2018La Gavina Azul\u2019. It was a sanctuary of joy amid the post-war\nreality, where the thrill of music and dance promised freedom from daily\nmonotony and poverty of that time.\n\nDOMESTIC DATA STREAMERS\n\nDozens of people have now had their memories turned into images in this way\nvia Synthetic Memories, a project run by Domestic Data Streamers. The studio\nuses generative image models, such as OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E, to bring people\u2019s\nmemories to life. Since 2022, the studio, which has received funding from the\nUN and Google, has been working with immigrant and refugee communities around\nthe world to create images of scenes that have never been photographed, or to\nre-create photos that were lost when families left their previous homes.\n\nNow Domestic Data Streamers is taking over a building next to the Barcelona\nDesign Museum to record people\u2019s memories of the city using synthetic images.\nAnyone can show up and contribute a memory to the growing archive, says\nGarcia.\n\nSynthetic Memories could prove to be more than a social or cultural endeavor.\nThis summer, the studio will start a collaboration with researchers to find\nout if its technique could be used to treat dementia.\n\n### Memorable graffiti\n\nThe idea for the project came from an experience Garcia had in 2014, when he\nwas working in Greece with an organization that was relocating refugee\nfamilies from Syria. A woman told him that she was not afraid of being a\nrefugee herself, but she was afraid of her children and grandchildren staying\nrefugees because they might forget their family history: where they shopped,\nwhat they wore, how they dressed.\n\nGarcia got volunteers to draw the woman\u2019s memories as graffiti on the walls of\nthe building where the families were staying. \u201cThey were really bad drawings,\nbut the idea for synthetic memories was born,\u201d he says. Several years later,\nwhen Garcia saw what generative image models could do, he remembered that\ngraffiti. \u201dIt was one of the first things that came to mind,\u201d he says.\n\nIn 1990, 14-year-old Emerund lived in a small Cameroonian village, spending\nhis afternoons helping his mother in the fields planting corn and potatoes\nafter school. These moments were a mix of duty and joy as he balanced the\nresponsibilities towards his family with the simple pleasures of being close\nto nature and his siblings. These memories from his childhood hold a special\nplace in his heart, as he remembered one specific part of the fields where his\nsiblings would play hide and seek with their mother.\n\nDOMESTIC DATA STREAMERS\n\nThe process that Garcia and his team have developed is simple. An interviewer\nsits down with a subject and gets the person to recall a specific scene or\nevent. A prompt engineer with a laptop uses that recollection to write a\nprompt for a model, which generates an image.\n\nHis team has built up a kind of glossary of prompting terms that have proved\nto be good at evoking different periods in history and different locations.\nBut there\u2019s often some back and forth, some tweaks to the prompt, says Garcia:\n\u201cYou show the image generated from that prompt to the subject and they might\nsay, \u2018Oh, the chair was on that side\u2019 or \u2018It was at night, not in the day.\u2019\nYou refine it until you get it to a point where it clicks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far Domestic Data Streamers has used the technique to preserve the memories\nof people in various migrant communities, including Korean, Bolivian, and\nArgentine families living in S\u00e3o Paolo, Brazil. But it has also worked with a\ncare home in Barcelona to see how memory-based reconstructions might help\nolder people. The team collaborated with researchers in Barcelona on a small\npilot with 12 subjects, applying the approach to reminiscence therapy\u2014a\ntreatment for dementia that aims to stimulate cognitive abilities by showing\nsomeone images of the past. Developed in the 1960s, reminiscence therapy has\nmany proponents, but researchers disagree on how effective it is and how it\nshould be done.\n\nThe pilot allowed the team to refine the process and ensure that participants\ncould give informed consent, says Garcia. The researchers are now planning to\nrun a larger clinical study in the summer with colleagues at the University of\nToronto to compare the use of generative image models with other therapeutic\napproaches.\n\nOne thing they did discover in the pilot was that older people connected with\nthe images much better if they were printed out. \u201cWhen they see them on a\nscreen, they don\u2019t have the same kind of emotional relation to them,\u201d says\nGarcia. \u201cBut when they could see it physically, the memory got much more\nimportant.\u201d\n\n### Blurry is best\n\nThe researchers have also found that older versions of generative image models\nwork better than newer ones. They started the project using two models that\ncame out in 2022: DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, a free-to-use generative\nimage model released by Stability AI. These can produce images that are\nglitchy, with warped faces and twisted bodies. But when they switched to the\nlatest version of Midjourney (another generative image model that can create\nmore detailed images), the results did not click with people so well.\n\n\u201cIf you make something super-realistic, people focus on details that were not\nthere,\u201d says Garcia. \u201cIf it\u2019s blurry, the concept comes across better.\nMemories are a bit like dreams. They do not behave like photographs, with\nforensic details. You do not remember if the chair was red or green. You\nsimply remember that there was a chair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they could see it physically, the memory got much more important.\u201d\n\n@MARCASENSIO_FOTO\n\nThe team has since gone back to using the older models. \u201cFor us, the glitches\nare a feature,\u201d says Garcia. \u201cSometimes things can be there and not there.\nIt\u2019s kind of a quantum state in the images that works really well with\nmemories.\u201d\n\nSam Lawton, an independent filmmaker who is not involved with the studio, is\nexcited by the project. He\u2019s especially happy that the team will be looking at\nthe cognitive effects of these images in a rigorous clinical study. Lawton has\nused generative image models to re-create his own memories. In a film he made\nlast year, called Expanded Childhood, he used DALL-E to extend old family\nphotos beyond their borders, blurring real childhood scenes with surreal ones.\n\n\u201cThe effect exposure to this kind of generated imagery has on a person's brain\nwas what spurred me to make the film in the first place,\u201d says Lawton. \u201cI was\nnot in a position to launch a full-blown research effort, so I pivoted to the\nkind of storytelling that's most natural to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLawton\u2019s work explores a number of questions: What will long-term exposure to\nAI-generated or altered images have on us? Can such images help reframe\ntraumatic memories? Or do they create a false sense of reality that can lead\nto confusion and cognitive dissonance?\n\nLawton showed the images in Expanded Childhood to his father and included his\ncomments in the film: \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t know what that is. Do I just\nnot remember it?\u201d\n\nNuria, now 90, vividly recalls the men and boys who waited outside bomb\nshelters in Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War, ready with picks and axes\nto rescue anyone trapped inside. These individuals, braving the danger of\nfalling bombs, showed incredible courage and selflessness. Their actions,\nrisking their lives to save others, left a lasting impression on Nuria. Even\nnow, she remembers in detail the clothes and dirty coats these men wore.\n\nDOMESTIC DATA STREAMERS\n\nGarcia is aware of the dangers of confusing subjective memories with real\nphotographic records. His team\u2019s memory-based reconstructions are not meant to\nbe taken as factual documents, he says. In fact, he notes that this is another\nreason to stick with the less photorealistic images produced by older versions\nof generative image models. \u201cIt is important to differentiate very clearly\nwhat is synthetic memory and what is photography,\u201d says Garcia. \u201cThis is a\nsimple way to show that.\u201d\n\nBut Garcia is now worried that the companies behind the models might retire\ntheir previous versions. Most users look forward to bigger and better models;\nfor Synthetic Memories, less can be more. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that OpenAI will\nclose DALL-E 2 and we will have to use DALL-E 3,\u201d he says.\n\n### by Will Douglas Heaven\n\n### Share\n\n  * Share story on linkedin\n\n  * Share story on twitter\n\n  * Share story on facebook\n\n  * Share story on email\n\n  * ### Popular\n\n    1.
