Viruses were far smaller than cells, and inside\ntheir protein shells they carried little more than genes. They could not grow,\ncopy their own genes or do much of anything. Researchers assumed that each\nvirus was a solitary particle drifting alone through the world, able to\nreplicate only if it happened to bump into the right cell that could take it\nin.\n\nThis simplicity was what attracted many scientists to viruses in the first\nplace, said Marco Vignuzzi, a virologist at the Singapore Agency for Science,\nResearch and Technology Infectious Diseases Labs. \u201cWe were trying to be\nreductionist.\u201d\n\nThat reductionism paid off. Studies on viruses were crucial to the birth of\nmodern biology. Lacking the complexity of cells, they revealed fundamental\nrules about how genes work. But viral reductionism came at a cost, Vignuzzi\nsaid: By assuming viruses are simple, you blind yourself to the possibility\nthat they might be complicated in ways you don\u2019t know about yet.\n\nFor example, if you think of viruses as isolated packages of genes, it would\nbe absurd to imagine them having a social life. But Vignuzzi and a new school\nof like-minded virologists don\u2019t think it\u2019s absurd at all. In recent decades,\nthey have discovered some strange features of viruses that don\u2019t make sense if\nviruses are lonely particles. They instead are uncovering a marvelously\ncomplex social world of viruses. These sociovirologists, as the researchers\nsometimes call themselves, believe that viruses make sense only as members of\na community.\n\nGranted, the social lives of viruses aren\u2019t quite like those of other species.\nViruses don\u2019t post selfies to social media, volunteer at food banks or commit\nidentity theft like humans do. They don\u2019t fight with allies to dominate a\ntroop like baboons; they don\u2019t collect nectar to feed their queen like\nhoneybees; they don\u2019t even congeal into slimy mats for their common defense\nlike some bacteria do. Nevertheless, sociovirologists believe that viruses do\ncheat, cooperate and interact in other ways with their fellow viruses.\n\nThe field of sociovirology is still young and small. The first conference\ndedicated to the social life of viruses took place in 2022, and the second\nwill take place this June. A grand total of 50 people will be in attendance.\nStill, sociovirologists argue that the implications of their new field could\nbe profound. Diseases like influenza don\u2019t make sense if we think of viruses\nin isolation from one another. And if we can decipher the social life of\nviruses, we might be able to exploit it to fight back against the diseases\nsome of them create.\n\n## Under Our Noses\n\nSome of the most important evidence for the social life of viruses has been\nsitting in plain view for nearly a century. After the discovery of the\ninfluenza virus in the early 1930s, scientists figured out how to grow stocks\nof the virus by injecting it into a chicken egg and letting it multiply\ninside. The researchers could then use the new viruses to infect lab animals\nfor research or inject them into new eggs to keep growing new viruses.\n\nIn the late 1940s, the Danish virologist Preben von Magnus was growing viruses\nwhen he noticed something odd. Many of the viruses produced in one egg could\nnot replicate when he injected them into another. By the third cycle of\ntransmission, only one in 10,000 viruses could still replicate. But in the\ncycles that followed, the defective viruses became rarer and the replicating\nones bounced back. Von Magnus suspected that the viruses that couldn\u2019t\nreplicate had not finished developing, and so he called them \u201cincomplete.\u201d\n\nSam D\u00edaz-Mu\u00f1oz at the University of California, Davis, applies social\nevolution theory originally developed to describe animal behavior, including\nconcepts like cheating and cooperation, to virus-virus interactions.\n\nCourtesy of Sam D\u00edaz-Mu\u00f1oz\n\nIn later years, virologists named the boom and bust of incomplete viruses \u201cthe\nvon Magnus effect.\u201d To them, it was important \u2014 but only as a problem to\nsolve. Since no one had seen incomplete viruses outside of a lab culture,\nvirologists figured they were artificial and came up with ways to get rid of\nthem.\n\n\u201cYou have to eliminate these from your lab stocks because you don\u2019t want them\nto interfere with your experiments,\u201d said Sam D\u00edaz-Mu\u00f1oz, a virologist at the\nUniversity of California, Davis, recalling the common view within the field.\n\u201cBecause this is not \u2018natural.\u2019\u201d\n\nResearchers in the 1960s observed that incomplete viral genomes were shorter\nthan those of typical viruses. That finding strengthened the view of many\nvirologists that incomplete viruses were defective oddities, lacking the genes\nneeded to replicate. But in the 2010s, inexpensive, powerful gene-sequencing\ntechnology made it clear that incomplete viruses were actually abundant inside\nour own bodies.\n\nIn one study, published in 2013, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh\nswabbed the noses and mouths of people sick with the flu. They pulled out the\ngenetic material from influenza viruses in the samples and discovered that\nsome of the viruses were missing genes. These stunted viruses came into\nexistence when infected cells miscopied the genome of a functional virus,\naccidentally skipping stretches of genes.\n\nOther studies confirmed this discovery. They also revealed other ways that\nincomplete viruses can form. Some kinds of viruses carry garbled genomes, for\nexample. In these cases, an infected cell started copying a viral genome only\nto reverse partway through and then copy the genome backward to its starting\npoint. Other incomplete viruses form when mutations disrupt the sequence of a\ngene so that it can no longer make a functional protein.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nMerrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine\n\nMerrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine\n\n## Introduction\n\nThese studies demolished the old assumption that von Magnus\u2019 incomplete\nviruses were only an artifact of lab experiments. \u201cThey\u2019re a natural part of\nvirus biology,\u201d D\u00edaz-Mu\u00f1oz said.\n\nDiscovering incomplete viruses in our own bodies has inspired a new surge of\nscientific interest in them. Influenza is not unique: Many viruses come in\nincomplete forms. They make up the majority of viruses found in people sick\nwith infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and measles.\n\nScientists have also come up with new names for von Magnus\u2019 incomplete\nviruses. Some call them \u201cdefective interfering particles.\u201d Others call them\n\u201cnonstandard viral genomes.\u201d\n\nD\u00edaz-Mu\u00f1oz and colleagues have another name for them: cheaters.\n\n## A Viral Grift\n\nIncomplete viruses can typically get into cells, but once inside, they cannot\nreplicate on their own. They lack some of the genes essential for hijacking\ntheir host\u2019s protein-making machinery, such as the one for a gene-copying\nenzyme known as a polymerase. In order to replicate, they have to cheat. They\nhave to take advantage of their fellow virus.\n\nFortunately for the cheaters, cells are often infected by more than one viral\ngenome. If a functional virus shows up in a cheater\u2019s cell, it will make\npolymerases. The cheater can then borrow the other virus\u2019s polymerases to copy\nits own genes.\n\nIn such a cell, the two viruses race to make the most copies of their own\ngenome. The cheater has a profound advantage: It has less genetic material to\nreplicate. The polymerase therefore copies an incomplete genome more quickly\nthan a complete one.\n\nTheir edge grows even larger over the course of an infection, as incomplete\nviruses and functional ones move from cell to cell. \u201cIf you\u2019re half as long,\nthat doesn\u2019t mean you get a two-times advantage,\u201d said Asher Leeks, who\nstudies social evolution in viruses as a postdoc at Yale University. \u201cThat can\nmean you get a thousand-times advantage or more.\u201d\n\nOther cheater viruses have working polymerases, but they lack the genes for\nmaking protein shells to enclose their genetic material. They replicate by\nlying in wait for a functional virus to show up; then they sneak their genome\ninto the shells it produces. Some studies suggest that cheater genomes may be\nable to get inside shells faster than functional ones.\n\nAsher Leeks\u2019 research into multipartite viruses, which must all be present in\na cell to replicate, has shown that what might look like viral cooperation may\nhave evolved from cheating. \u201cIn viruses, conflict is dominant,\u201d he said.\n\nNora Pyenson\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhichever strategy an incomplete virus uses to replicate, the result is the\nsame. These viruses don\u2019t pay the cost of cooperation, even as they exploit\nthe cooperation of other viruses.\n\n\u201cA cheater does poorly on its own, it does better in relation to another\nvirus, and if there are a lot of cheaters, there\u2019s no one to exploit,\u201d D\u00edaz-\nMu\u00f1oz said. \u201cFrom an evolutionary perspective, that\u2019s all you need to define\ncheating.\u201d\n\nThe last part of that definition poses a puzzle. If cheaters are so amazingly\nsuccessful \u2014 and, indeed, they are \u2014 they ought to drive viruses to\nextinction. As generations of viruses burst out of old cells and infect new\nones, cheaters ought to get more and more common. They should keep replicating\nuntil the functional viruses disappear. Without any functional viruses left,\nthe cheaters can\u2019t replicate on their own. The entire population of viruses\nshould get sucked into oblivion.\n\nOf course, viruses such as influenza are clearly escaping this swift\nextinction, and so there must be more to their social lives than a death\nspiral of cheating. Carolina L\u00f3pez, a virologist at Washington University\nSchool of Medicine in St. Louis, believes that some viruses that look like\nthey\u2019re cheating may actually play a more benign role in viral societies.\nInstead of exploiting their fellow viruses, they cooperate, helping them\nthrive.\n\n\u201cWe think of them as part of a community,\u201d L\u00f3pez said, \u201cwith everybody playing\na critical role.\u201d\n\n## Burnout Prevention\n\nL\u00f3pez\u2019s initiation into the world of sociovirology started in the early 2000s\nas she studied Sendai virus, a pathogen that infects mice. Researchers had\nknown for years that two strains of Sendai virus behaved differently. One,\ncalled SeV-52, was good at escaping the notice of the immune system, allowing\nthe virus to cause a massive infection. But mice infected with another strain,\nSeV-Cantell, mounted a swift, powerful defense that helped them quickly\nrecover. The difference, L\u00f3pez and her colleagues found, was that SeV-Cantell\nproduced a lot of incomplete viruses.\n\nHow were incomplete viruses triggering the mice\u2019s immune systems? After a\nseries of experiments, L\u00f3pez and her colleagues established that incomplete\nviruses cause their host cells to activate an alarm system. The cells produce\na signal called interferon, which lets neighboring cells know an invader has\narrived. Those cells can prepare defenses against the viruses and prevent the\ninfection from spreading like wildfire through the surrounding tissue.\n\nCarolina L\u00f3pez hypothesized that while incomplete viruses may cheat inside a\ngiven cell, their overall effect \u2014 keeping infectious spread in check \u2014 may\nbenefit the entire viral community.\n\nMatt Miller / Washington University School Of Medicine\n\nThis phenomenon wasn\u2019t a quirk of Sendai virus, nor of the mouse immune\nsystem. When L\u00f3pez and her colleagues turned their attention to RSV), which\nsickens over 2 million people in the United States every year and causes\nthousands of deaths, they found that incomplete viruses produced in natural\ninfections also triggered a strong immune response from infected cells.\n\nThis effect puzzled L\u00f3pez. If incomplete viruses were cheaters, it didn\u2019t make\nsense for them to provoke a host to cut an infection short. Once the immune\nsystem destroyed the functional viruses, the cheaters would be left without\nany victims to exploit.\n\nLopez found that her results made sense if she looked at the viruses in a new\nway. Instead of focusing on the idea that the incomplete viruses were\ncheating, L\u00f3pez began to think about them and the functional viruses as\nworking together toward the shared goal of long-term survival. She realized\nthat if functional viruses replicated uncontrollably, they might overwhelm and\nkill their current host before transmission to a new host could take place.\nThat would be self-defeating.\n\n\u201cYou need some level of immune response for just keeping your host alive long\nenough for you to move on,\u201d L\u00f3pez said.\n\nThat\u2019s where the incomplete viruses come in, she said. They might rein in the\ninfection so that their host has a chance to pass viruses onto the next host.\nIn that way, the functional and incomplete viruses might be cooperating. The\nfunctional viruses produce the molecular machinery to make new viruses.\nMeanwhile, the incomplete viruses slow the functional viruses down to avoid\nburning out their host, which would end the entire community\u2019s infectious run.\n\nIn recent years, L\u00f3pez and her colleagues have found that incomplete viruses\ncan curb infections in a number of ways. They can trigger cells to respond as\nif they were under stress from heat or cold, for example. Part of a cell\u2019s\nstress response shuts down the protein-building factories to save energy. In\nthe process, it also halts the production of more viruses.\n\nIn new research published in February, Christopher Brooke reported that an\ninfected cell can produce hundreds of cryptic proteins that are encoded by\nincomplete viral genomes and new to science.\n\nFred Zwicky\n\n## Introduction\n\nChristopher Brooke, a virologist at the University of Illinois Urbana-\nChampaign, agrees with L\u00f3pez that viruses exist in communities. What\u2019s more,\nhe suspects that incomplete viruses have other jobs in cells that he and his\nfellow scientists have yet to figure out.\n\nBrooke is looking for evidence of these jobs in influenza viruses. A complete\ninfluenza virus has eight gene segments, which typically make 12 or more\nproteins. But when infected cells produce incomplete viruses, they sometimes\nskip the middle of a gene and stitch the beginning to the end. Despite this\ndrastic change, these altered genes still produce proteins \u2014 but new proteins\nthat may have new functions. In a study published in February, Brooke and his\ncolleagues discovered hundreds of these new proteins in flu-infected cells.\nBecause these proteins are new to science, the researchers are trying to\nfigure out what they do. Experiments on one of them suggest that it latches on\nto polymerase proteins made by intact viruses and blocks them from copying new\nviral genomes.\n\nFor now, however, scientists are largely ignorant of what incomplete viruses\naccomplish by producing so many strange proteins. \u201cMy limited imagination\nisn\u2019t going to touch a fraction of what\u2019s possible,\u201d Brooke said. \u201cThis is raw\nmaterial for the virus to play with.\u201d But he doubts that the incomplete\nviruses producing all these strange proteins are cheaters.\n\n\u201cIf they really were acting as pure cheaters, I would predict that there would\nbe substantial selective pressure to minimize their production,\u201d Brooke said.\n\u201cAnd yet we see them all the time.\u201d\n\n## Blurred Lines\n\nSociovirologists are now trying to figure out just how much cheating and\ncooperation are going on in the viral world. Scientists who study animal\nbehavior know how hard this can be. An individual may cheat in some situations\nand cooperate in others. And it\u2019s also possible for a behavior that looks like\ncooperation to evolve through selfish cheating.\n\nLeeks agrees that incomplete viruses may be productive parts of the viral\ncommunity. But he thinks it\u2019s always important to consider the possibility\nthat even when they look like they\u2019re cooperating, they are still actually\ncheating. Evolutionary theory predicts that cheating will often arise in\nviruses, thanks to their tiny genomes. \u201cIn viruses, conflict is dominant,\u201d\nLeeks said.\n\nMerrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine\n\nMerrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn fact, cheating can produce adaptations that look like cooperation. One of\nLeeks\u2019 favorite examples of this hidden conflict is the nanovirus, which\ninfects plants such as parsley and fava beans. Nanoviruses replicate in an\nastonishing way. They have eight genes in total, but each viral particle has\njust one of the eight genes. Only when all nanovirus particles, each carrying\none of the eight different genes, are infecting the same plant at once can\nthey replicate. The plant cells make proteins from all eight genes, along with\nnew copies of their genes, which then get packaged into new shells.\n\nYou might look at nanoviruses and see a textbook case of cooperation. After\nall, the viruses have to work together for any of them to have a chance to\nreplicate. The arrangement is reminiscent of a beehive\u2019s division of labor, in\nwhich the insects split the work of gathering nectar, tending to larvae and\nscouting new locations for the hive to move to.\n\nBut Leeks and his colleagues have charted how nanoviruses \u2014 and other so-\ncalled multipartite viruses \u2014 may have evolved through cheating.\n\nUnderneath the fa\u00e7ade of cooperation lies viral cheating.\n\nImagine that the ancestor of nanoviruses started off with all eight genes\npackaged in one viral genome. The virus then accidentally produced incomplete\ncheaters that had only one of the genes. That cheater will thrive, as the\nfully functional viruses copy its gene. And if a second cheat evolves,\ncarrying a different gene, it will get the same benefit of exploiting the\nintact viruses.\n\nWhen Leeks and his colleagues built a mathematical model for this evolutionary\nscenario, they found that viruses can readily break apart into more cheats.\nThey will keep breaking apart until none of the original viruses that could\nreplicate on their own are left. Nanoviruses may now depend on each other for\nsurvival, but only because their ancestors freeloaded off each other.\nUnderneath the fa\u00e7ade of cooperation lies viral cheating.\n\nSorting out the nature of virus societies will take years of research. But\nsolving the mystery may bring a tremendous payoff. Once scientists understand\nthe social behavior of viruses, they may be able to turn viruses against one\nanother.\n\n## Turning the Tables\n\nIn the 1990s, evolutionary biologists were able to help inform the development\nof antiviral medicines. When people with HIV took a single antiviral drug, the\nvirus quickly evolved the ability to evade it. But when doctors instead\nprescribed medicines that combined three antivirals, it became much harder for\nthe viruses to escape them all. The chance that a virus could gain mutations\nto resist all three drugs was astronomically small. As a result, HIV drug\ncocktails remain effective even today.\n\nSociovirologists are now investigating whether evolutionary biology can again\nhelp in the fight against viruses. They are looking for vulnerabilities in the\nway viruses cheat and cooperate, which they can exploit to bring infections to\na halt. \u201cWe see it as turning the tables on the virus,\u201d Vignuzzi said.\n\nVignuzzi and his colleagues tested this idea in mice with Zika virus. They\nengineered incomplete Zika viruses that could ruthlessly exploit functional\nones. When they injected these cheaters into infected mice, the population of\nfunctional viruses inside the animals quickly collapsed. The French company\nMeletios Therapeutics has licensed Vignuzzi\u2019s cheater viruses and has been\ndeveloping them as a potential antiviral drug for a variety of viruses.\n\nAt New York University, Ben tenOever and his colleagues are engineering what\nmight be an even more effective cheater from influenza viruses. They\u2019re taking\nadvantage of a quirk of virus biology: Every now and then, the genetic\nmaterial from two viruses that infect the same cell will end up packaged into\none new virus. They wondered if they could create a cheating virus that could\nreadily invade the genome of a functional influenza virus.\n\nCould incomplete viruses be used in medicine? Ben tenOever\u2019s cutting-edge\nresearch has produced a nasal spray of cheater virus that equipped mice to\nsurvive a fatal strain of influenza. However, because this cheater virus can\nspread between animals, the chances of regulators approving such an approach\nfor human medicine seems low.\n\nMarcel Indik Photography\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe NYU team harvested incomplete viruses from influenza-infected cells. From\nthis batch, they identified a super-cheater that was remarkably good at\nslipping its genes into fully functional influenza viruses. The resulting\nhybrid virus was bad at replicating, thanks to the cheater\u2019s disruption.\n\nTo see how this super-cheater would perform as an antiviral, tenOever and his\ncolleagues packaged it into a nasal spray. They infected mice with a lethal\nstrain of influenza and then squirted the super-cheater into the animals\u2019\nnoses. The super-cheater virus was so good at exploiting functional viruses\nand slowing their replication that the mice managed to recover from the flu\nwithin a couple weeks. Without help from the super-cheaters, the animals died.\n\nThe researchers got even better results when they sprayed the super-cheaters\ninto the noses of mice before they got infected. The super-cheaters lay in\nwait inside the mice and attacked the functional flu viruses as soon as they\narrived.\n\nThen tenOever and his colleagues moved to ferrets for their experiments.\nFerrets experience influenza infections more like humans do: In particular,\nunlike with mice, influenza viruses will readily spread from a sick ferret to\na healthy one in an adjacent cage. The scientists found that the nasal spray\nquickly drove down the number of flu viruses in infected ferrets, just as they\nsaw in mice. However, the scientists got a surprise when they looked at the\nviruses that the infected ferrets passed to healthy animals. They transmitted\nnot only normal viruses but also super-cheaters stowed away inside their\nprotein shells.\n\n## Related:\n\n  1. ### Viruses Can Scatter Their Genes Among Cells and Reassemble\n\n  2. ### Viruses Have a Secret, Altruistic Social Life\n\n  3. ### How Many Microbes Does It Take to Make You Sick?\n\n  4. ### Viruses Would Rather Jump to New Hosts Than Evolve With Them\n\nThat finding raises the tantalizing possibility that super-cheaters might be\nable to stop the spread of a new strain of influenza. If people received\nsprays of super-cheater viruses, they could rapidly recover from infections.\nAnd if they did pass on the new virus strain to others, they would also pass\nalong the super-cheater to stop it. \u201cIt\u2019s a pandemic neutralizer,\u201d tenOever\nsaid.\n\nThat\u2019s true in concept, at least. TenOever would need to run a clinical trial\nin humans to see if it would work as it does in animals. However, regulators\nhave had qualms about approving such an experiment, he said, as that would not\nsimply be giving people a drug that would work on viruses in their own bodies,\nbut also one that could spread to others, whether they consented to it or not.\n\u201cThat seems to be the kiss of death,\u201d tenOever said, for his hopes of turning\nthe science of social viruses into medicine.\n\nD\u00edaz-Mu\u00f1oz thinks that it\u2019s right to be cautious about harnessing\nsociovirology when we still have so much to learn about it. It\u2019s one thing to\ncreate medicines from inert molecules. It\u2019s quite another to deploy the social\nlife of viruses. \u201cIt is a living, evolving thing,\u201d D\u00edaz-Mu\u00f1oz said.\n\nBy Carl Zimmer\n\nContributing Writer\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nbiologycellscooperationevolutionary biologygenesgenomesinfectious\ndiseasevirusesAll topics\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nThe Quanta Newsletter\n\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\n## Also in Biology\n\nneuroscience\n\n### Overexposure Distorted the Science of Mirror Neurons\n\nBy Meghan Willcoxon\n\nApril 2, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\nneuroscience\n\n### The Social Benefits of Getting Our Brains in Sync\n\nBy Marta Zaraska\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\nThe Joy of Why\n\n### How Is Flocking Like Computing?\n\nBy Steven Strogatz\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\n## Comment on this article\n\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive,\ncivil conversation.
