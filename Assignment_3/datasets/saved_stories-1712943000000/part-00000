As temperatures continue to rise, keeping CO_2 from\nentering the atmosphere can help limit warming where carbon-based fuels are\nstill needed.\n\nSignificant progress has been made in creating affordable, practical carbon\ncapture technologies. Carbon-capturing liquids, referred to as solvents when\nthey are present in abundance, can efficiently grab CO_2 molecules from coal-\nfired power plants, paper mills, and other emission sources. However, these\nall work through the same fundamental chemistry, or so researchers have\nassumed.\n\nIn new work published in Nature Chemistry, scientists were surprised to find\nthat a familiar solvent is even more promising than originally anticipated.\nNew details about the solvent's underlying structure suggest that the liquid\ncould hold twice as much CO_2 as previously thought. The newly revealed\nstructure could also hold the key to creating a suite of carbon-based\nmaterials that could help keep even more CO_2 out of the atmosphere.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) team developed the solvent\nseveral years ago and has studied it in a variety of scenarios. The team has\nworked to dial down the costs of using the solvent and turn up its efficiency.\nLast year, they revealed the least costly carbon capture system to date. It\nwas during this research that the team noticed something odd.\n\n\"We were trying to do a different type of high-pressure gas separation,\" said\nDavid Heldebrant, a PNNL chemist and co-corresponding author. \"We saw that the\nsolution got significantly thicker and a new peak appeared in our spectra,\nindicating something new had formed. It was totally unexpected and we knew we\nhad to get to the bottom of it.\"\n\nHeldebrant reached out to his collaborators at the University Claude Bernard\nLyon 1 and the University of Texas at El Paso to help untangle the molecular\nchanges behind the results.\n\n\"This work is a truly interdisciplinary and collaborative effort,\" said Jose\nLeobardo Ba\u00f1uelos, a professor at the University of Texas at El Paso. \"The\nquestions we needed to ask required more than just one type of expertise. We\nlooked at the overall structure of the solvent when exposed to CO_2 and saw\nsubstantially more order than we expected.\"\n\nThe molecules, it seemed, were clustering when they ought to be paired. But\nwhat did the new, tidily ordered structures mean?\n\n## Causing change through clusters\n\nWhen the team took a fresh look at the solvent-CO_2 system using analytical\nchemistry tools, they detected self-assembled clusters of solvent molecules.\nAt first, the researchers tried to fit the data to a model using only two\nmolecules of solvent. Despite their starting expectation, the data just didn't\nfit.\n\nWhen the researchers used a model with four solvent molecules, the results\nfell into place. A four-component cluster was actually the form of the solvent\nthe team had been seeing. The flexible structure can undergo a series of\nshifts to accommodate incoming CO_2 molecules. The CO_2 eventually reaches the\ncore of the cluster, home to an active site pocket that may be similar to\nthose that exist inside enzymes. In fact, the overall cluster structure and\ninteractions seem to resemble proteins.\n\nMeasurements of the solvent and carbon dioxide showed the presence of something unexpected. Credit: Andrea Starr | Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\n\nThe active site binding pocket is at the center of the newly observed\nchemistry. Typically, carbon capture systems work with a single CO_2 molecule\nwhich binds and may react to form something different. Having everything\nconstrained to reactions involving one CO_2 limits the next steps of carbon\nconversion. The cluster enables something different.\n\nThe unexpected peak the team originally found corresponds to the formation of\na new species that includes two different molecules of CO_2. The clusters\nincorporate CO_2 stepwise, first capturing and activating one molecule\nfollowed by the second. The data show a cooperative effect\u2014having one molecule\nof CO_2 bound changes how the second molecule binds.\n\n\"We're really excited about the new solvent design possibilities this opens\nup,\" said Heldebrant. \"If we can find ways to intentionally build in\ncooperativity that enhances CO_2 binding, we could change how carbon capture\nsystems operate.\"\n\n## Finding new reactivity\n\nOnce both CO_2 molecules are inside the cluster they can react with one\nanother, creating different carbon-based molecules that could expand potential\nuses of captured CO_2.\n\n\"What we're doing here is changing a major variable in the process,\" said\nHeldebrant. \"We've historically captured each CO_2 on its own. Binding two\nCO_2 together could help us effectively double the storage capacity of our\ncapture systems.\"\n\nThe newly connected molecules have very different properties from CO_2. This\nchanges the chemistry required to separate the captured carbon from the\nsolvent. These CO_2-based molecules are larger and represent a first step\ntowards creating CO_2-rich polymers.\n\nOne persistent issue with captured carbon is what to do with it. While long-\nterm storage of CO_2 is an option, it presents logistical challenges and can\nadd cost to an already expensive capture process. Finding ways to convert\ncaptured CO_2 into economically valuable products could help offset capture\ncosts and provide a step toward a closed carbon cycle.\n\nBy joining two CO_2 molecules together during the initial capture step, this\nwork presents a new way to approach carbon conversion and utilization. Instead\nof starting with CO_2, researchers could have different options to create new\nchemicals. This opens doors to different types of chemistry previously\nconsidered unrealistic for CO_2 conversion. These potential next steps are\nonly possible by focusing on the fundamental science behind carbon capture.\n\n\"There's so much urgency in deploying carbon capture systems,\" said Julien\nLeclaire, a professor at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1 and co-\ncorresponding author of the paper. \"We don't always explore the molecular-\nscale details of these processes due to their complexity. But sometimes we can\nfind insights that connect molecular and large-scale behavior.\"\n\nIn addition to Heldebrant, PNNL researchers include Katarzyna Grubel, Eric\nWalter, Ying Chen, Difan Zhang, Manh Thuong Nguyen, Debmalya Ray, Sarah Allec,\nDeepika Malhotra, Wontae Joo, and Jaelynne King. In addition to Leclaire,\nUniversity Claude Bernard Lyon 1 researchers include Jean Septavaux and Marc\nHennenbelle.\n\nMore information: Julien Leclaire et al, Tetrameric self-assembling of water-\nlean solvents enables carbamate anhydride-based CO2 capture chemistry, Nature\nChemistry (2024).
