Imagine it\u2019s the 1960s and electrical engineers and\ncoders are colonizing a golden valley of dipping hills and collective\ncommunes. Miraculously, they build a thriving computer industry in what seems\nlike a matter of months. It prospers. This cyber-land comes to occupy the\nhopes and dreams of the whole nation, especially its youngest generation.\nWhere are we?\n\nBulgaria. It is not the first place many people would think of. In the popular\nimagination (and in much economics scholarship), Bulgaria is a poster child\nfor rural agrarianism and underdevelopment. Cold War Bulgaria conjures an even\nmore inauspicious image as one of the most stalwart political vassals of the\nSoviet Union.\n\nBut by the 1980s, Bulgaria was one of the world\u2019s major producers of\ncomputers. By conservative estimates, one in every 10 industrial workers was\nemployed by the computer industry. The country held a 45 percent market share\nof electronic exports inside the Eastern Bloc. Its executives rubbed shoulders\nwith Bill Gates and Steve Jobs in 1980s California and sold the PCs powering\nIndia\u2019s IT revolution. Its children were taught coding in communist youth\ngroups, attended computer clubs, and swapped comic books depicting cyborg\nLenins and a socialist ChatGPT. The country\u2019s factories built pneumatic robot\ncombines that could automate manufacturing, and its manufacturers supplied\nmicroprocessors for the state-of-the-art satellite Interkosmos 22 pinging\naround Earth\u2019s orbit.\n\nHow did this happen? And why on earth haven\u2019t we heard about this cyber-land\nbefore? The second question is easier to answer. We haven\u2019t heard of it\nbecause it collapsed in 1990, and winners don\u2019t like remembering losers. And\nbecause Bulgaria is classed as \u201cperipheral.\u201d It is on the margins of every\nmap: Europe, the Cold War, the global economy, the digital revolution.\nPolicymakers and trendsetting gurus don\u2019t tend to look for answers to big\nissues in these \u201csmall\u201d and unfamiliar places (unless doing so involves a\nhappiness index). This is finally changing. Some of the best history books\nbeing written today are turning \u201cto the margins\u201d to find previously\nunrecognized laboratories of modernity.\n\nThe Bulgarian-produced Pravetz 82 PC ca. 1985\u201386, from Pereslavl Week.\nLicensed by CC-BY-SA 3.0.\n\nVictor Petrov\u2019s new book Balkan Cyberia: Cold War Computing, Bulgarian\nModernization, and the Information Age Behind the Iron Curtain is a must-read\nfor anyone interested in how the Iron Curtain was short-circuited in the\ndigital age. Tracing the rise and fall of Bulgaria\u2019s powerful computer\nindustry, it is really three stories in one. The first interweaves the global\nsupply chain geopolitics of sourcing products and markets for Bulgarian tech\nwith the industry\u2019s political, cultural, and social impact within Bulgaria.\nThe second adds a new layer to regional accounts of state-building and\neconomic development in postwar Europe. And the third turns what at first\nappears to be a Cinderella story of communist modernization into a stimulating\ninside-out history of late-20th-century capitalism. Petrov offers rich\npickings for each story\u2019s likely audience, whether security and tech policy\nfans of Chris Miller\u2019s Chip War: The Fight for the World\u2019s Most Critical\nTechnology (2022) or readers interested in the surprising dynamism of\ncommunism\u2019s waning years.\n\nWithin these three stories, four plotlines are especially salient for the\ncontemporary moment: the power of East\u2013South markets; espionage\u2019s role in tech\ninnovation; the nonrole, or even pointlessness, of sanctions and embargoes;\nand noncapitalists\u2019 construction of capitalism. Petrov argues that the\nenormous \u201cSecond World\u201d market for tech and tech ideas in the Cold War must be\ntaken seriously. We can\u2019t risk being blind. The exchange of ideas and\ntechnologies between Bulgaria and India is a case in point, and is likely to\nhaunt us in the future.\n\nSo will the complex symbiosis between the Bulgarian tech sector and state\nintelligence, which is emblematic of a much broader feature\u2014still largely\nunexamined thus far\u2014of the late-20th-century Information Age. The symbiosis of\ndomestic expertise and foreign espionage drove Bulgaria\u2019s tech takeoff, and it\npoints to a bigger challenge: understanding how technological knowledge is\ngenerated when the \u201cdistinction between licit and illicit exchange becomes\nmeaningless\u201d in the production of entities like computers or algorithms.\n\nAs for trade embargoes and export license regimes for countries like China and\nRussia, they are flaunted as innovative and effective tools for controlling\nthe spread of new technologies. But they are neither. The Coordinating\nCommittee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom)\u2014opaque and understudied as\nwell\u2014was launched by the United States and its allies to \u201ccontain\u201d the Soviets\nin late 1947. Balkan Cyberia shows that it actually energized Bulgarian tech\nambition instead.\n\nJapan was key here: it served as \u201cthe gap in CoCom\u2019s armor.\u201d It was a close US\nally and anticommunist partner. But in the 1960s, it delinked trade from\npolitics in an effort to expand its economy and grew to become the Soviet\nUnion\u2019s largest trading partner in the capitalist world. In May 1970,\nBulgarian premier Todor Zhivkov became the first Bloc leader to visit Japan\nand subsequently fantasized about transforming Bulgaria into a \u201cmini-Japan.\u201d\nFrom the mid-1960s, the Fujitsu corporation embarked on a long relationship\nwith Bulgaria\u2019s nascent computer industry. It sold licenses for its top\nmachines, taught FORTRAN and COBOL programming languages, and received\nBulgarian specialists for multiyear spells at factories and Japanese\nuniversities.\n\nBulgaria\u2019s first mass-produced computer in 1969, largely copied on a Japanese\nequivalent, was not the only outcome of this relationship. Petrov shows how a\nsteady stream of future engineers, economic managers, politicians, and spies\nwent to 1970s Japan and then brought back much more than microchips and\ncomputer prototypes. Stowed in their luggage were the illicit ideas of Milton\nFriedman and the Chicago school of economics, the optimization models of\nmanagement consultancies, and Singapore autocrat Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s From Third\nWorld to First. These texts became their inspirational blueprints. Something\nstrange was happening in the heart of communist Europe.\n\nBulgaria proceeded to redesign its socialist economy to accommodate contracts\nand partnerships with nonsocialist firms. This meant fostering capitalist\nenclaves already in the mid-1970s, which were \u201cjudicially independent capital\nassociations and islands of \u2018bourgeois\u2019 law in the central economy.\u201d Major\nWestern firms like American conglomerate Control Data Corporation looked for\ncheap manufacturing abroad and promised their Bulgarian counterparts that they\nwould \u201cfly under the embargo radar.\u201d In a stunning measure of how far\nBulgaria\u2019s industry had come, they even stressed the interoperability of their\nown computing systems. In turn, Bulgarian tech sought to win American\nconsumers. In an incredible side story, Petrov relates how a project was\nlaunched to win some of the multibillion-dollar US market for floppy disks, as\nwell as China\u2019s, by rebranding Bulgarian products and sidestepping sanctions.\nIn the process, Bulgarian state firms displayed their full integration into\nthe 1980s world of extraterritorial multinationals. They procured a British\nshell firm to ensure they only paid 4.5 percent US tax rather than 80 percent,\nand a British offshore holding company in Hong Kong to whisk away revenue.\n(Britain makes regular cameos as another chink in CoCom\u2019s armor).\n\nCan noncapitalists build capitalism, asks Petrov? Benjamin Peters\u2019s\ntrailblazing study, How Not to Network a Nation: The Uneasy History of the\nSoviet Internet (2016), outlines why the Soviet Union failed to develop an\ninternet while the United States succeeded, and the book offers a surprising\nexplanation: \u201cThe [US] capitalists behaved like socialists while the [Soviet]\nsocialists behaved like capitalists.\u201d In other words, the United States\u2019\ninternet precursor ARPANET was achieved through strong government support and\nsubsidies, whereas the Soviet attempts were torpedoed by the \u201cself-interest\u201d\nof its bureaucrats and experts. The Bulgarian case is different because it did\nsucceed\u2014partly due to the fact that Petrov\u2019s protagonists were able to outplay\nthe capitalists at their own game. They copied the code and then rewrote it.\n\nThe tandem question of whether autocrats can build democratic, participatory\ntechnologies already seems well answered today (yes, they can). The idea that\nstate-of-the-art tech can\u2019t prosper in repressive spaces is clearly\ndelusional. But we are still unsure about whether this means we need to\nrethink democracy itself. Petrov largely sidesteps the story of Bulgaria\u2019s own\npolice state. For this, we can read Martin K. Dimitrov\u2019s excellent\nDictatorship and Information: Authoritarian Regime Resilience in Communist\nEurope and China (2023), a major work in its own right, which explores how\nChina and Bulgaria grew information-collection \u201cecosystems\u201d that were\nextensive but surprisingly analog.\n\nFront cover of magazine Computer for You, 1986. Courtesy of ABVA foundation.\n\nPetrov reminds us that state-sponsored tech booms do not occur in a cultural\nvacuum. Personal computers were hard to buy and often out of stock for\nBulgarian consumers, but there was still considerable trickle-down to everyday\nlife, notwithstanding barriers to access. In one particularly interesting\nsection, he considers the formation of a young generation of socialist cyber-\nnerds through comics, magazines, and clubs. In 1984, Bulgaria\u2019s communist\nyouth organization sponsored a successful network of such computer clubs. They\ngrew from 28 in 1985 to 530 by 1987, spread across the country in factories,\nschools, and youth centers. They also opened in Moscow, Leningrad, Kyiv, and\nKharkiv, as well as Havana, Addis Ababa, Pyongyang, and Hanoi. A new magazine,\nComputer for You, supplied young subscribers with entire code packages,\ncreating a cyber republic of letters that was replete with interviews, forums,\nand satirical cartoons. Surprisingly, it was insulated from censorship. One\ncartoon, published before preustroistvo (communist Bulgaria\u2019s period of reform\nand liberalization from 1986), even showed a man accusing his computer of\nwriting a denunciation to the secret police against him.\n\nThe most prodigious outgrowth of this cybernetic culture was science fiction,\nwidely circulated and accessed through comics and book series. Petrov shares\nsome of these, including fantastic premonitions of hallucinating AI bots, like\nThe Missed Chance: Stories from My Computer (Propusnatiyat Shans, 1981), in\nwhich a computer linked to the national library\u2019s databases produces stories\nfor a bored writer until he realizes that it has been mockingly throwing his\nown writing at him all along.\n\nJaroslav \u0160velch\u2019s superb book Gaming the Iron Curtain: How Teenagers and\nAmateurs in Communist Czechoslovakia Claimed the Medium of Computer Games\n(2023) also offers insight into the cultural footprint of late communist\ncomputing. \u0160velch shows how, in the 1980s, the Eastern Bloc was a dynamic\nlaboratory for digital game designs that interwove personal expression with\npolitical protest. He follows a generation of teenagers in Czechoslovakia who\nreworked newly available computers and a \u201ccottage arcade industry\u201d to design\nsome of the very first \u201cprotest games\u201d for home computers. Hobbyists merged\nAtari visuals and gameplay with the realities of late socialism: boredom,\npolice violence, and fantasy. You can even play one of these original protest\ngames, The Adventures of Indiana Jones in Wenceslas Square in Prague on\nJanuary 16, 1989, converted by \u0160velch and translated into English, online. It\nwas written months before the Velvet Revolution of 1989 was launched in the\nsame square. Just be careful of the regime\u2019s fearsome riot police and their\ntruncheons.\n\nWhen communism collapsed, so did Bulgaria\u2019s enormous computing industry.\nBillions of state assets evaporated through the acquiescence or direct\ninvolvement of Party elites, who reinvented themselves overnight as\ncapitalists and democrats. Balkan Cyberia is also a personal story for Petrov\nin this regard. In 1989, his father was training for a high-flying career in\nBulgaria\u2019s socialist cyberworld where \u201ceverything was forever, until it was no\nmore.\u201d Petrov recalls growing up in 1990s Varna playing Prince of Persia and\nDuke Nukem on the Pravetz PCs that communist Bulgaria had built, and his\nfather pointing to the once-thriving, now-empty electronics factory that had\nemployed him. But communism\u2019s last generation of teenagers still had the final\nword.\n\nBulgaria became the world\u2019s leading exporter of computer viruses. In December\n1990, The New York Times reported that 90 of all the 300 known viruses\ndesigned to attack IBM computers came from a faraway country on the Black Sea.\nJohn McAfee complained that Bulgarian-made viruses represented one in 10 of\ninquiries received by his antivirus firm. Young Bulgarians, an industry figure\nnamed Veselin Bonchev explained, had \u201cquickly acquired software-writing\nskills, but had little or no chance to apply them constructively.\u201d Viruses\nwith names like Nomenklatura and Made in Bulgaria plagued global systems. On\nthe ruins of Bulgaria\u2019s communist utopian cyber-economy, the most prolific and\nfeared virus writer of all, named the Dark Avenger, emerged to wreak havoc on\nthe world\u2019s computers at the moment Francis Fukuyama had proclaimed the end of\nhistory. Was it really? And who was this Dark Avenger? Was it one person? A\ngroup or collective? A nation, perhaps? We still don\u2019t know. But with Victor\nPetrov\u2019s groundbreaking book, at least now we have the story of the Bulgarian\ncomputer and its astonishing global reach.\n\n\u00a4\n\nAlex Langstaff is a PhD candidate in history at NYU and will be a residential\nfellow at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure in Paris.\n\nLARB Contributor\n\nAlex Langstaff is a PhD candidate in history at New York University and will\nbe a residential fellow at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure in Paris.
