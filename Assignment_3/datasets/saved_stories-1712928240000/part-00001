The add-on will be available for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nonwards.\n\nLong term supported Ubuntu releases get five years of standard security\nmaintenance on the main Ubuntu repository. Ubuntu Pro expands that commitment\nto 10 years on both the main and universe repositories, providing enterprises\nand end users alike access to a vast secure open source software library. The\nsubscription also comes with a phone and ticket support tier. Ubuntu Pro\npaying customers can purchase an extra two years of security maintenance and\nsupport with the new Legacy Support add-on.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to offer our customers additional years of security\nmaintenance and support for Ubuntu LTS releases\u201d, said Maximilian Morgan,\nGlobal VP of Support Engineering at Canonical. \u201cDrawing on 20 years of\nexcellence in open source, Canonical delivers expert security maintenance and\nsupport for customers around the world. With Legacy Support, we empower\norganisations to navigate their operational needs and investments into open\nsource with confidence, ensuring their systems remain available, secure, and\nsupported for many years to come\u201d.\n\n## Ideal for stability and peace of mind\n\nRunning the latest operating system (OS) offers new features and enhanced\nperformance, which is a good choice for new deployments. However, for large,\nestablished production systems, the transition to a new OS version presents a\nchallenge as it may involve updating the entire software stack running on top\nof it. This complexity is amplified by modern software architectures that\nincorporate containerisation, microservices, extensive data management\nfeatures, as well as integration with third-party APIs.\n\nGiven these multifaceted challenges, ensuring the system remains operational,\nsecure, and supported is paramount. Organisations looking to gain peace of\nmind and stability while they plan and execute their migration strategy can\ntrust Canonical.\n\n## 12 years of timely security fixes and support\n\nSecurity maintenance is part of a continuous process that proactively protects\nsystems. It includes regular vulnerability scanning, evaluation and patch\nmanagement. With Ubuntu Pro, Canonical provides continuous vulnerability\nmanagement for critical, high and medium Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\n(CVEs) across all software packages shipped with Ubuntu. Canonical\u2019s security\nteam actively backports these crucial fixes to all supported Ubuntu LTS\nreleases, giving enterprises and end users peace of mind to keep their systems\nsecure without requiring a major upgrade.\n\nSupport is a user-triggered service that comes into play when incidents occur\nor additional expertise is required to address complex issues. Customers\nlooking to strengthen their business continuity strategy with open source\nexpertise can rely on Canonical support for troubleshooting, break fixes, bug\nfixes and guidance.\n\n## Available for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Trusty Tahr and future LTS releases\n\nUbuntu Pro coverage for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS will end in April 2024. With Legacy\nSupport, organisations running their systems on top of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS can\nobtain an additional two years of expanded security maintenance and phone and\nticket support. This enables IT managers to prepare a detailed upgrade plan\nfor the next LTS, and software architects to concentrate on the application\nlevel with the support offered by Canonical\u2019s team.\n\nLearn more about Ubuntu Pro and the Legacy Support add-on at\nhttps://ubuntu.com/pro, https://ubuntu.com/support or contact Canonical for\nmore information.\n\n### Talk to us today\n\nInterested in running Ubuntu in your organisation?\n\n##### Newsletter signup\n\n### Related posts\n\n#### Canonical Delivers Secure, Compliant Cloud Solutions for Google\nDistributed Cloud\n\nToday, Canonical is thrilled to announce our expanded collaboration with\nGoogle Cloud to provide Ubuntu images for Google Distributed Cloud.
