With no hesitation,\nDeChambeau inserted them in the bag at the Masters.\n\nAvoda is a Hebrew word with multiple meanings, one of which is precision.\nAccording to Avoda\u2019s website, the company makes two different types of irons,\none-length irons like the clubs DeChambeau played when he was sponsored by\nCobra, and combo-length irons.\n\n\u201cThe faces have some bulge to them, they are one-of-a-kind,\u201d said Mike Schy,\nDeChambeau\u2019s longtime coach, who described them as onset. \u201cWhat happens if you\nhit it on the toe? It hooks a lot, right? What happens if you hit it on the\nheel? It cuts a lot. When you have bolts, that offsets that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an adventure,\u201d Schy added.\n\nThat adventure began in November when Schy took a couple of forged clubs and\ninserted bolts from the center to the toe. DeChambeau hit them and liked them\nimmediately. The question became: How to produce them?\n\nBryson DeChambeau walks onto the No. 2 green during a practice round for the\n2024 Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club. (Photo: Adam Cairns-USA\nTODAY Sports)\n\nDeChambeau parted ways with Cobra-Puma Golf last year. He has worked with\nother clubmakers and has found limited options to build him clubs to his\nspecific needs and wants.\n\n\u201cThose ships have sailed,\u201d he said of the major OEM\u2019s. \u201cI told Bryson\neventually you\u2019re going to have to do these things by yourself. You have the\nmoney to do it now.\u201d\n\nThe irons are made by one of Schy\u2019s students, Tom Bailey, owner of Avoda\nirons, who set out to sell a few hundred sets of irons a year to help pay for\nhis golf habit.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s crazy like us,\u201d said Schy, who noted that DeChambeau isn\u2019t an investor\nin the company.\n\nBut DeChambeau mapped out exactly what he wanted the irons to be. Bailey\u2019s\nbrother created a CAD file, and they found a supplier in China, who took one\nlook at the irons and declared, \u201cIt can\u2019t be done,\u201d Schy said. \u201cI said,\n\u2018Welcome to Bryson\u2019s world.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThey tried to do a CNC version initially but based on DeChambeau\u2019s demands, it\nneeded to be a two-piece club and the only way to produce it quickly was via\n3-D printing. The irons failed to pass muster with the USGA as recently as\nlast week. The grooves were too narrow because of the way a 3-D printer prints\nin layers. Connor Olson, manager of DeChambeau\u2019s company BAD, buffed and\ngrinded the grooves until they were deemed conforming. The USGA signed off on\nMonday and DeChambeau decided to put them in play at the biggest tournament of\nthe year.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have it any other way,\u201d Schy said.\n\nBryson DeChambeau checks a club before a practice round for the 2024 Masters\nat Augusta National Golf Club.

For Cobra, one-length irons are 7-iron-length (37.25\ninches).\n\nSchy was in Dallas with DeChambeau two weeks ago and said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen\nhim hit it so good.\u201d\n\nDeChambeau was asked about his equipment changes during his post-round press\nconference and confirmed that he had changed irons, but remained coy about the\ndetails.\n\n\u201cI put new irons in this week. I think that\u2019s a pretty big change. And been\nusing this new driver, 3-wood and 5-wood,\u201d he said. \u201cSo pretty much my whole\nbag is different since Greenbrier of last year, and putter is the only thing\nthat\u2019s remained the same.\u201d\n\nLater, speaking to Golf Channel, he said of the irons, \u201cIt\u2019s a speed thing...\nwhen I miss hit on the toe or the heel it seems to fly a lot straighter for me\nand that\u2019s what has allowed me to be more comfortable over the ball.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cLive From,\u201d Golf Channel\u2019s Brandel Chamblee said the concept had good\nmerit. \u201c(Curvature) allows woods to have forgiveness and I thought \u2018Why have\nwe never had that on irons?\u2019 As the week goes on, I will certainly be watching\nhis iron play to see if in fact it is an improvement because it really is an\ninteresting concept.\u201d\n\n### More Masters\n\n### Scottie Scheffler on lessons learned from Jack Burke Jr., bogey-free first\nround at 2024 Masters\n\n### These notables are in danger of missing the cut after first day of the\n2024 Masters\n\n### Masters introduces caddie Christmas ornament to gnome family at Augusta\nNational\n\n### How did the amateurs do in the first round of the 2024 Masters?\n\n### Masters 2024 second round tee times, how to watch Friday at Augusta\nNational\n\nSee more equipment: Best drivers for 2024 | Best irons for 2024 | Best putters for 2024 | Best golf balls for 2024\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.
