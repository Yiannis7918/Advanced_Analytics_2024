We visited\nustwo games to to uncover its story and find out what happens next\n\n  * Sign up to our newsletter Newsletter\n\n(Image credit: ustwo games)\n\nBy Jonathan Bell\n\npublished 2 days ago\n\nIt\u2019s been 10 years since tiny development studio ustwo games released Monument\nValley, a game that presented a radically different approach to mobile gaming,\ncreated a genre and inspired independent studios and game design around the\nworld. The studio is tucked away in a converted warehouse in South London.\n\nIt\u2019s a typical tech space, with a quiet ambience of concentration and\ncreativity, filled with oversized plants and colourful shelves scattered with\nthe detritus of modern culture, from plastic toys to stacks of board games.\nThe company employs around 45 people, with everything brought together on this\nsite, from level and character design to coding, sound and internal testing.\n\n(Image credit: ustwo games)\n\nDanny Gray, ustwo games\u2019s Chief Creative Officer, explains how the game\noriginally got off the ground. \u2018We were a tiny team, part of ustwo\u2019s London\ndesign agency,\u2019 he recalls. The agency, founded by Matt Miller and John\nSinclair in 2004, had started to branch out into the relatively new world of\nmobile gaming. Working with lead designer and game director Ken Wong, Gray and\nhis skeleton team devised games that looked as if they came from a design\nagency, not a typical gaming background.\n\nOne of the early sketches for Monument Valley\n\n(Image credit: ustwo games)\n\nTasked with developing a showcase for the agency as well as an intriguing\ngame, the concept came together relatively quickly. \u2018We started off with reams\nand reams of concept art,\u2019 says Gray, \u2018it was all very audience-led \u2013 we\u2019d pin\nit up on the walls of the studio and invite comments. It was an isometric\ndrawing of architecture that got the most attention.\u2019 Almost straight away,\nthis image led to a prototype of a single-screen game where you had to guide a\ncharacter from \u2018point A to point B.\u2019 One key gameplay mechanism, however,\narose out of a graphical glitch; one of the sliding blocks appeared to move\n\u2018impossibly\u2019, instantly introducing the element of optical illusion and\ninviting new ways to navigate the on-screen world.\n\nEarly concept art explored a surreal, axonometric world\n\n(Image credit: ustwo games)\n\nAs anyone who\u2019s ever played the two Monument Valley games will know, each\nlevel is meticulously constructed. \u2018From that idea to launch was took less\nthan a year,\u2019 says Gray, \u2018Just six people made the game from beginning to\nend.\u2019 The team was aiming for a modest total of 100,000 downloads, hoping to\nraise its profile \u2013 it was treated like a piece of marketing. The main energy\nwent into carefully composing the levels. \u2018It had to be all killer, no filler,\nwith each level having its own core mechanism like a specific type of\nrotation,\u2019 Gray explains, \u2018we started with 30 levels and whittled it down to\n10. We were all about polish, not size.\u2019\n\nThe development process was intensive, paring levels down to the very best\npuzzles\n\n(Image credit: ustwo games)\n\nThe small team was so laser-focused on delivering the best game they could\nthat the name wasn\u2019t even considered until the very end. \u2018Right before launch\nwe were going to be interviewed by Edge magazine \u2013 the morning of that day we\nhadn\u2019t picked the name.\u2019 Monument Valley was chosen as being familiar, yet\nunusual, implying a sense of mystery, grandeur and travel.\n\nSome of the final levels in the first Monument Valley\n\n(Image credit: ustwo games)\n\nThe Edge feature included a number of intriguing screenshots. \u2018They got the\nball rolling \u2013 people wanted to know how it played,\u2019 says Gray. A couple of\nrounds of beta testing opened the game up to swathes of influential people in\nthe design and gaming industries. \u2018It helped to position the game in a more\nhighbrow way,\u2019 Gray says, \u2018the impossible angles blew people away \u2013 it was\nlike a form of street magic.\u2019\n\n## Wallpaper* Newsletter\n\nReceive our daily digest of inspiration, escapism and design stories from\naround the world direct to your inbox\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe game captivated audiences even through static screenshots\n\n(Image credit: ustwo games)\n\nRight out of the gate, Monument Valley got crucial support from Apple. \u2018Google\nweren\u2019t especially supportive [of the Android version] as it didn\u2019t have any\nof the traditional gaming elements like in-app purchases,\u2019 says Gray, \u2018Apple\nsaw the value straight away. They flagged up in the App store and even used it\nin their own marketing material.\u2019\n\nUltimately Monument Valley was available on Android and Apple phones and\ntablets, as well as PC\n\n(Image credit: ustwo games)\n\nThe end result had a pixel-perfect axonometric aesthetic that not only went\nhard on its references to Dutch master artist and printmaker Maurits Cornelis\nEscher, but also dug deep into classic video game design, going right back to\nearly arcade machines and 8-bit titles. Each of the ten levels is like a piece\nof fine furniture, built with invisible dovetail joints and inlaid with\nmarquetry, stuffed with secret compartments and little design flourishes. Gray\ncites the world of theatre and stage design, as well as graphics, as important\nkeystones in the way the levels were constructed. \u2018Ken would always talk about\nflower arranging, and how you frame a silhouette of a level on the screen,\u2019 he\nsays.\n\n(Image credit: ustwo games)\n\nAnother aspect of Monument Valley that feels ahead of its time was its calm,\nmindful pace, buoyed by the lavish graphics and soothing music. Everyone from\nBrian Eno to Steve Reich influenced the sound of the finished product. \u2018Myself\nand Ken ended up sitting down and drafting a Spotify playlist. We ended up\nusing a track by Chicago-based musician Obfusc for the trailer, and that set\nthe tone,\u2019 says Gray, \u2018there were also a lot of sound tests, where we gave the\ngame to different sound designer and asked them to comp in ideas.\u2019 The end\nresult, with music by Todd Baker, is a minimal, ethereal and synthetic\nsoundscape, where \u2018every level is in effect an audio-visual toy.\u2019\n\nThe series has inspired copious fan art\n\n(Image credit: ustwo games)\n\nReleased ten years ago this week, Monument Valley was soon followed by an\nexpansion, Forgotten Shores, which added in some of the omitted levels. \u2018It\nwas basically a full game again, which was a bad business decision, but gave\nit a huge spike in popularity,\u2019 says Gray. Awards followed, including\nrecognition from BAFTA, Apple and D&AD, and it became a pop cultural staple, a\nrare crossover from the gaming world. \u2018It was featured in Netflix\u2019s House of\nCards as a key plot device \u2013 this gave us a whole new audience,\u2019 Gray recalls.\n\nAs well as the occasional bit of merchandise\n\n(Image credit: ustwo games)\n\nMonument Valley 2 was released in 2017 and to date the series has exceeded 160\nmillion installs. Even though it\u2019s been well over six years, Monument Valley 3\nis now in an advanced stage of production. \u2018It takes a long time for that well\nof creativity to be replenished,\u2019 Gray admits, \u2018it\u2019s not the kind of game you\ncan just do with 100 similar-looking levels.\u2019 These days, ustwo games is a\ntotally separate company to the Shoreditch-based design agency. A new\ndevelopment team is also bringing a new perspective. \u2018We\u2019re taking the\noriginal concept in surprising and different ways,\u2019 says Gray, \u2018I always\nthought MV1 was quite pure and MV2 was very narrative driven. MV3 will have\nthe best of both worlds.\u2019\n\nLevels from Monument Valley 2\n\n(Image credit: ustwo games)\n\nSecrecy is tight around the new title for now, with suggestions that it\u2019ll be\nsomething that can be replayed, rather than the very linear models of the\nfirst two games. Dynamic lighting is also on the cards, thanks largely to\nincreases in the computing power of our mobile devices. As mentioned, Monument\nValley simultaneously harked back to early computer graphics and fine art, yet\nit also introduced a clean, minimalist style that has proved incredibly\ninfluential, especially in the indie gaming sphere.\n\nA number of events have been set up to celebrate the 10th anniversary\n\n(Image credit: ustwo games)\n\nFor Gray and the rest of the team at ustwo, the game was the making of the\nstudio, as well as a rare example of pure creativity and innovation receiving\ndue commercial reward. \u2018These days there\u2019s less diversity and innovation [in\ngaming],\u2019 he muses, \u2018Something can\u2019t just make a bit of money, it has to make\nall the money. It\u2019s the antithesis of creativity. We have to allow ourselves\nto work on the things that exist in the gaps of the algorithm. Monument Valley\nwas a bet on ourselves, one that came back 100-hold. Hopefully Monument Valley\n3 will hark back to a time when we could take these kinds of risks and be\ninnovative.\u2019\n\n(Image credit: ustwo games)\n\nMonument Valley 1 and 2 are available on the Apple App Store and Google Play,\nas well as on Steam. The series is also coming to Netflix gaming later this\nyear.\n\nFor more information about the 10th anniversary, visit ustwo games,\nustwogames.co.uk, @ustwogames\n\nJonathan Bell\n\nJonathan Bell has written for Wallpaper* magazine since 1999, covering\neverything from architecture and transport design to books, tech and graphic\ndesign.
