They can also be difficult to recall when angry.\n\nThe results of this study, published in Scientific Reports, are the\nculmination of years of previous research on the association between the\nwritten word and anger reduction. It builds on work showing how interactions\nwith physical objects can control a person\u2019s mood.\n\nFor their project, Kawai and his graduate student Yuta Kanaya, both at the\nGraduate School of Informatics, Nagoya University, asked participants to write\nbrief opinions about important social problems, such as whether smoking in\npublic should be outlawed. They then told them that a doctoral student at\nNagoya University would evaluate their writing.\n\nHowever, the doctoral students doing the evaluation were plants. Regardless of\nwhat the participants wrote, the evaluators scored them low on intelligence,\ninterest, friendliness, logic, and rationality. To really drive home the\npoint, the doctoral students also wrote the same insulting comment: \u201cI cannot\nbelieve an educated person would think like this. I hope this person learns\nsomething while at the university\u201d.\n\nAfter handing out these negative comments, the researchers asked the\nparticipants to write their thoughts on the feedback, focusing on what\ntriggered their emotions. Finally, one group of participants was told to\neither dispose of the paper they wrote in a trash can or keep it in a file on\ntheir desk. A second group was told to destroy the document in a shredder or\nput it in a plastic box.\n\nThe students were then asked to rate their anger after the insult and after\neither disposing of or keeping the paper. As expected, all participants\nreported a higher level of anger after receiving insulting comments. However,\nthe anger levels of the individuals who discarded their paper in the trash can\nor shredded it returned to their initial state after disposing of the paper.\nMeanwhile, the participants who held on to a hard copy of the insult\nexperienced only a small decrease in their overall anger.\n\nKawai imagines using his research to help businesspeople who find themselves\nin stressful situations. \u201cThis technique could be applied in the moment by\nwriting down the source of anger as if taking a memo and then throwing it away\nwhen one feels angry in a business situation,\u201d he explained.\n\nAlong with its practical benefits, this discovery may shed light on the\norigins of the Japanese cultural tradition known as hakidashisara (hakidashi\nrefers to the purging or spitting out of something, and sara refers to a dish\nor plate) at the Hiyoshi shrine in Kiyosu, Aichi Prefecture, just outside of\nNagoya. Hakidashisara is an annual festival where people smash small discs\nrepresenting things that make them angry. Their findings may explain the\nfeeling of relief that participants report after leaving the festival.\n\nThe study, \u201cAnger is eliminated with the disposal of a paper written because\nof provocation,\u201d was published in Scientific Reports on April 9, 2024, at DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-57916-z.\n\nAuthors:\n\nYuta Kanaya, Nobuyuki Kawai\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nMatthew Coslett\n\nInternational Communications Office, Nagoya University\n\nEmail: icomm_research@t.mail.nagoya-u.ac.jp\n\nTop image: Physically disposing of a piece of paper containing your angry\nthoughts in a shredder (left) effectively neutralizes the anger, whereas\nputting it in a plastic box (right) does not. credit: Photos by Yuta KANAYA\n\nPrevious\n\nInformatics list\n\nnext\n\n## CATEGORY\n\n  * ALL\n  * Agricultural sciences\n  * Biological sciences\n  * Biology\n  * Chemistry\n  * Complex systems\n  * Engineering\n  * Environmental science\n  * Humanities\n  * Informatics\n  * Interdisciplinary science and engineering\n  * Mathematical and physical sciences\n  * Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy\n\n## TAG\n\n  * Graduate School of Medicine (36)\n  * Graduate School of Engineering (28)\n  * Graduate School of Science (26)\n  * Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences (15)\n  * Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research (13)\n  * Institute of Transformative Bio-Molecules (11)\n  * Graduate School of Environmental Studies (10)\n  * Institute for Advanced Research (8)\n  * ITbM (8)\n  * Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (8)\n  * Graduate School of Informatics (7)\n  * Institute of Materials and Systems for Sustainability (7)\n  * Arabidopsis (6)\n  * Artificial intelligence (5)\n  * Aurora (5)\n  * Evolution (5)\n  * Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (5)\n  * Hisashi Kajimura (5)\n  * Kenichiro Itami (5)\n  * Aging (4)\n\n### RESEARCH PROGRAMS\n\n  * Institutes of Innovation for Future Society\n\n  * Institute of Transformative Bio-Molecules\n\n  * Office for GaN Research Strategy\n\n  * Kobayashi-Maskawa Institute for the Origin of Particles and the Universe\n\n  * Center for Low-temperature Plasma Sciences\n\n### Academics-Industrial Cooperation\n\n  * Faculty Directory\n  * Collaborative Research / Academics-Industrial Cooperation\n  * Ethics\n\n### Links\n\n  * Nagoya University\n  * Nagoya University Foundation\n  * Researchers\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Nagoya University.
