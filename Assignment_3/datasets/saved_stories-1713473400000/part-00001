It's a powerful tool in\nleadership but often goes underutilized and misunderstood.\n\nWhat exactly is the role of context in effective leadership? What are the\naspects that make it so powerful?\n\nWebster\u2019s defines context as (a) the parts of a written or spoken\ncommunication which precede or follow a word, sentence, or passage, and affect\nits meaning, and (b) the surrounding environment, circumstances or facts which\nhelp give a total picture of something.\n\nThe Latin root of the word texere is \"to weave\". In our day to day dealings,\ncontext is so interwoven into everything we do that we don't pay attention to\nit. And there lies both the oversight and the opportunity for leaders to be\nmore effective.\n\n## Two powerful examples of the use of context in leadership\n\nA couple of stories from our recent history stand out as powerful examples\nwhere leaders changed the context to effect a different set of actions and\nresults.\n\nOn July 4th 1776 the founding fathers of the United States signed the\ndeclaration of independence. What they wrote in that document completely\nchanged the context within which their actions would be judged. Before the\ndeclaration they would have been subjects acting unlawfully against the crown\nwhereas after the declaration they were a sovereign nation rising up against\ntyrrany and standing for freedom.\n\n> While the actions(content) might have been the same, the meaning of their\n> actions and that of the entire newly formed country was diametrically\n> opposite in light of the new context that they created.\n\nAnd this new context was created through language. It changed not only the\nmeaning of their actions but the actions of the entire newly formed country\nand generations to follow.\n\nIn his inaugural address , JFK said \u201cAsk not what your country can do for\nyou\u2014ask what you can do for your country.\u201d When he made this statement he\ncompletely changed how individuals looked at their personal actions. He\nchanged it from a self-centered, what\u2019s in it for me perspective, to one of\ncontribution and a larger purpose beyond just themselves.\n\nIn one simple statement, he connected their personal meaning and purpose to\nthe country\u2019s. He used the power of context.\n\n> Instead of issuing a decree or orders, JFK changed the context so that the\n> following actions changed naturally.\n\nThe founding fathers as well as JFK shifted how a given situation showed up by\nchanging the context through the masterful use of language. They were\nengineering a context for their people. They were designing the context\ninstead of accepting the default version.\n\nBy changing the context they increased the capacity for action both for\nthemselves and others.\n\n## Leaders as managers of meaning and co-constructors of reality\n\nIn complex, non-technical situations, which is true of most organizations and\nleaders today, there is no one right answer. Meaning is created through the\nlanguage constructs we use, and by how these constructs intervene in\neveryone\u2019s mental models and representations of reality.\n\nAs Gail Fairhurst puts it, leaders need to:\n\n> ...understand their role as managers of meaning and co-constructors of\n> reality: individuals who [are] frequently powerless to control the\n> turbulence of their environments, but who [can] control the context under\n> which turbulence is seen.\n>\n> \u2013 Gail Fairhurst [1]\n\nAs leaders we might not be able to change the factual details of our\nparticular situation but we can change what meaning we make out of it and how\nwe approach it.\n\n> The real world imposes constraints of many, many kinds ... Freedom, in the\n> real world, is not utter license to do as we please; it is much closer to\n> Robert Frost\u2019s famous formula\u2014\u201cmoving easy in harness.\u201d\n>\n> Constraints are always there. It\u2019s a matter of how we move within them.\n>\n> \u2013 Robert Bethune [2]\n\nSituations where the answers are not clear, that\u2019s when context becomes the\nlynchpin. By controlling and changing the context of a given situation through\nlanguage, leaders change the way a particular challenge or situation shows up\nfor themselves and their teams.\n\n> When the tasks of work are complex, there are no shortcuts. Senior managers\n> need to spend the time necessary to shape an organizational context that\n> will allow people to focus on value.\n>\n> \u2013 Yvez Morieux, Boston Consulting Group [3]\n\nOur actions are driven by the way a situation shows up for us which in turn is\ninfluenced by the context within which it shows up. Thus by changing the\ncontext we change our ensuing actions.\n\nIf something occurs to us as \u201cjust laying bricks\u201d we can change the context so\nthat the same task shows up as \u201cbuilding a cathedral\u201d. Our approach towards\nthe former vs the latter is diametrically opposite.\n\n> One drives ownership and accountability whereas the other reeks of\n> disengagement and callousness.\n\nWhile the example might be simplistic, this drives at the very core of what\nleadership is about. One of the simplest definitions of leadership is\n\u201cdelivering on something that was not going to happen anyway\u201d. And context is\none of the keys to making that happen.\n\n\ud83d\udca1\n\nLiking this article? Trymy newsletter.

Spans 70 years, comes\ncomplete with categories and short summaries.\n\n## Leaders naturally have a larger context\n\nIn many ways, leaders automatically have more context than their teams. Not\nonly are they one level removed but they are also embedded within other\nnumerous and larger networks than their teams are.\n\nAssuming that our teams have that same context is a classic mistake.\n\n> And because [leaders] are not caught up in the granular details of the work,\n> they often see things that others do not. You might say they have more\n> \u201ccognitive room for maneuver\u201d which puts them in a position to supercharge\n> team performance\u2014for example, by asking the right questions, challenging\n> matter-of-fact assumptions, or providing a broader context and new\n> information.\n>\n> \u2013 Yvez Morieux, Boston Consulting Group [3]\n\nOur teams are naturally more closer to the content so the leader might not\nnecessarily be helping by delving in content themselves. In other words,\ncontrol. Context is where leaders can make the most impact.\n\n## The role of context in leadership\n\nWhat is it about context that makes it so powerful and why do leaders need to\npay more attention to it? What are the different ways in which it plays a big\nrole in leadership?\n\n> When one of your people does something dumb, don\u2019t blame that person.\n> Instead, ask yourself what context you failed to set. Are you articulate and\n> inspiring enough in expressing your goals and strategy? Have you clearly\n> explained all the assumptions and risks that will help your team to make\n> good decisions? Are you and your employees highly aligned on vision and\n> objectives?\n>\n> \u2014 Reed Hastings, Erin Meyer in No Rules Rules [10]\n\n### Context is directly tied to results and performance\n\nContext is the background from which all our actions flow regardless of our\nawareness of it. We can either design a context or let the situation dictate\nit and be affected by it.\n\n> Results are tied to actions. The intent behind changing a context is to\n> increase our capacity for action.\n\nTeams are often stuck in a stalemate because the challenge does not occur to\nthem as actionable or as a reachable target. This is where most of the\nopportunity for improvement lies as people are usually pretty good at changing\nthe content itself.\n\nContext on the other hand tends to be hidden, transparent and not in focus.\nThus it is the leader\u2019s greatest opportunity to make an impact by changing the\ncontext or at least bringing the current context into focus so that it may be\nmore accessible and thus can be modified or replaced completely\n\n> Performance is the result of what people do\u2014their actions, interactions, and\n> decisions. To understand organizational performance, managers must trace\n> that performance back to what people do and the way their behaviors combine\n> with each other to produce overall results. To change behavior, it is more\n> effective to change the context instead of trying to change people\u2019s mind-\n> sets. When the context changes, behaviors adjust, and when people behave the\n> way they do, their values, feelings, and mentalities evolve accordingly.\n>\n> \u2013 Yvez Morieux & Peter Tollman in Six Simple Rules [4]\n\nContext can unlock action and previously unseen possibilities. It can bring\ninto focus aspects that were previously invisible.\n\nPerformance is directly tied to actions which are in turn tied to context.\nInstead of dictating or decreeing change in action which we as leaders are\nmore inclined to do, a change in context can automatically trigger a change in\nbehavior. This is especially relevant in knowledge work where our teams tend\nto know a lot more about the technical issues than we do.\n\nContext drives the way your team sees the problem and hence behaves. Thus\nchanging context can directly influence results. As Werner Erhard puts it,\naction is a correlate of the occurring and the occurring happens within a\ncontext.\n\nChanging the context can change how a situation occurs to someone. This is\ndifferent from just telling someone to think out of the box or to act\ndifferently.\n\n### Context drives motivation and engagement\n\nThe \u201csoft approach\u201d to management is common today as is evidenced by more\nteam-building, recognitions, swag and so on. Companies are trying to appear\nmore humane and try to manufacture connection. But this kind of superficial\ndriving of engagement can go only so far. Sooner or later we either go numb to\nit or just see through it.\n\nPurpose, meaning, and connection comes from within. They are not sustainable\nwhen it gets pushed from the outside.\n\n> We have the mistaken notion that meaning and purpose can be transmitted.\n\nWe humans have to create our own meaning and purpose. People need to connect\nthe organization\u2019s goals to their own. It\u2019s the leader\u2019s job to connect these\ntwo.\n\nAnd context is the connecting tissue between organizational goals and people\u2019s\npersonal goals. Without context, your organization\u2019s goals can appear\nmeaningless and purposeless outside the paycheck they receive. This is how you\nget disengaged, low-performing teams that are on auto-pilot and who do not\npush themselves.\n\n> A leader\u2019s job is to engineer the types of conversations that produce\n> epiphanies. Conversations that reveal we are capable of original thought.\n> Intelligent, spirited conversations that provide clarity and impetus for\n> action, for change. Yet too often, we, the results-smitten, speak only of\n> measurable goals, key business indicators, action plans, cash-flow\n> projections, economic indicators, process, and procedure. All are worthy\n> come-ons, yet true success requires conversations that exert a deeper\n> magnetism, a pull as powerful as the tides.\n>\n> \u2013 Susan Scott in Fierce Conversations [5]\n\nContext can be the binding agent for high performance teams. Without context\nthere is no common goal or purpose. In fact that is the function of having\ngoals, purpose, and a vision. They give context that in turn drives our day-\nto-day actions.\n\n### Context creates empathy\n\nA shared context can create natural empathy and team cohesion, shared meaning\nand purpose, and a sense of mission. Empathy can come more easily if one\nunderstands the context within which another person is acting. Instead of\ntrying to manufacture empathy, it follows more naturally if we see the\nsituation through the other person\u2019s eyes, or in other words by understanding\ntheir context.\n\n### Context creates meaning\n\nContext can create shared understanding which creates shared meaning which in\nturn creates more engagement. Without a context that is relatable, your\nmessage might not reach its intended audience. And assuming a common context\nis not smart either.\n\nContext is the background of our understanding and what gives meaning to what\nwe do. The very same actions under different contexts have very different\nmeanings.\n\nWithout context there is no common background for understanding leading to\nmisinterpretation and confusion.\n\n> Context clarifies purpose. Many of the things we do on a daily basic can\n> come across as meaningless and directionless without an overarching context\n> or purpose. The leader\u2019s job is to create that context.\n\n### Context defines and colors our experience\n\nAll of our actions happen within a context and the context defines our\nexperience more than the actual content and details of what is happening.\nContext can make the mundane extraordinary as described in the story of the\nthree bricklayers where one sees it as a task, another as a career and the\nthird as a calling. Leaders, by design or otherwise, end up creating the\ncontext in which these actions show up.\n\nBarry Schwartz uses the metaphor of framing to describe the power of context.\n[6]\n\n> In framing the scene, we are setting the picture off from its surroundings,\n> excluding what is on the outside and defining what is inside as special and\n> worthy of attention. Frames tell us what is important and help us establish\n> what should be compared with what. The capacity we have to frame enables us\n> to do one of the most important things that practical wisdom demands\u2014discern\n> what is relevant about a particular context or event in regard to the\n> decision we face. Learning to frame well helps make us wise.\n>\n> \u2013 Barry Schwartz & Kenneth Sharpe in Practical Wisdom\n\nTerms like vision, mission statement and core values have lost their meaning\ndue to overuse and lack of connection to personal meaning and purpose. Context\ncan help change that dynamic. When looking from the lens of context these are\nall tools to create the context within which organizations do their work and\nthus influence their culture.\n\n### Context is more malleable & accessible through language\n\nTrying to change the content directly is where most of the frustration and\nhelplessness around situations usually comes because you cannot change the\nfacts of the situation. Context on the other hand tends to be more malleable\nand open to interpretation. This in turn increases the leader\u2019s opportunity\nset to intervene.\n\nContext is usually directly accessible through language and hence can be\nrecursively looked at and changed through the skillful use of language.\n\n> It\u2019s frequently been pointed out that man is unable to observe or recognize\n> an event until there\u2019s a prior context and language for naming the event.\n> This inability, called paradigm blindness, is the direct consequence of a\n> limitation of context.\n>\n> \u2013 David Hawkins in Power vs Force [7]\n\nContext is more amenable to the tools of language like metaphors, analogies\nand stories, and thus can be more malleable and accessible once we develop the\nability to identify and change it.\n\n### Context is invisible and thus full of opportunities\n\nContext is the invisible fabric through which our situation is interwoven. It\nis also where most of our blindspots, biases, blocks, mental models and taken-\nfor-granted assumptions usually lie dormant and unexamined, while at the same\ntime influencing our course of actions. This is equally true for companies and\norganizations.\n\n> When a company reinvents itself, it must alter the underlying assumptions\n> and invisible premises on which its decisions and actions are based. This\n> context is the sum of all the conclusions that members of the organization\n> have reached.\n>\n> It is the product of their experience and their interpretations of the past,\n> and it determines the organization\u2019s social behavior, or culture. Unspoken\n> and even unacknowledged conclusions about the past dictate what is possible\n> for the future.\n>\n> \u2013 Richard Pascale, Tracy Goss/Reinvention Roller coaster/Harvard Business\n> Review [8]\n\nContext is not something that we are naturally wired to look into. A changing\ncontext naturally causes us insecurity and discomfort.\n\nOur particular version of reality and our mental models have served a purpose\nand so we are likely to stick with it. It goes against our nature to try to\nchange it ourselves.\n\nThis is where leaders can come in and try to unstick the pervading mental\nmodels by introducing and reinforcing new language and new interpretations\nthat lead to different actions and different results. This is also the reason\nwhy organizational change can be so hard.\n\n### Context is key to skilled communication\n\nContext can add a knockout punch to your communication. \u201cSpeaking out of\ncontext\u201d is almost a cliche but on a more subtle note, not setting the context\nin your communication is something leaders cannot afford.\n\nAssuming a shared context, without actually trying to engineer it, is also a\nrecipe for miscommunication.\n\n> Understanding doesn\u2019t proceed simply from examining data; it comes from\n> examining data in a particular context. Information is useless until we know\n> what it means.\n>\n> To understand its meaning, we don\u2019t only need to ask the right question; we\n> also need the appropriate instruments with which to measure the data in a\n> meaningful process of sorting and description.\n>\n> \u2013 David Hawkins in Power vs Force [7]\n\nAs leaders we make the mistake of assuming communication as the transfer of\ninformation. Information on its own does not necessarily have any meaning. It\ncan carry multitudes of meaning; the same content under different contexts can\nmean very different things.\n\nThe particular version of meaning that we want to transmit depends on the\ncontext within which we share that information. Thus context is almost more\nimportant than the details or the content itself.\n\n### Context helps navigate a VUCA world\n\nContext can be the guiding north star or compass when navigating unchartered\nand uncertain territory.\n\n> The role of the senior manager in an agile organization is not to determine\n> the content of people\u2019s work. Rather, it is to provide the context for that\n> work.\n>\n> That means helping employees understand how their immediate objectives\n> relate to the organization\u2019s strategic and business goals. Senior managers\n> need to articulate a robust strategic context that teams can use as a \u201cNorth\n> Star\u201d that aligns their autonomy to those goals, guiding them as they\n> exercise their initiative.\n>\n> \u2013 Yvez Morieux, Boston Consulting Group [3]\n\n### Context drives ownership and accountability\n\nPushing agendas and strategies across the organization without making sure\nthat everyone understands the context is a recipe for disengagement and\napathy.\n\nWhen combined with context, the same agendas and strategies drive\nparticipation and engagement as it ensures shared understanding. Thus context\ncan engender participation, ownership and accountability.\n\n### Context changes locus of control from external to internal\n\nContext influences our attitudes and behaviors. For everything else being the\nsame, our experience can be different under different contexts.\n\nMost of the time, our experience of context is that of outside-in, something\nthat is not within our control. We see circumstances as happening to us.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t realize is that most of it is created by us. It is rather\ninside-out. We are creating our own context and this context is built in\nlanguage.\n\n### Context creates conditions for autonomy and mastery\n\nAutonomy and mastery are two major factors that drive engagement. And context\nis a key enabler for both.\n\nWhen leaders delve less in content and more in context, it gives teams and\nindividuals the wiggle room to navigate on their own and in the process get\nmore access to conditions that enable autonomy and mastery.\n\nInstead of creating rules for every little eventuality aka content, context\ncan act as an overarching theme that can guide those actions thus letting\npeople be more autonomous.\n\n### Context improves decision making and problem solving\n\nYou cannot understand another\u2019s context by being limited to your own views. In\norder to get context you have to understand other points of view and other\nperspectives not yet considered. It forces us to look beyond what is normal\nand comfortable for us.\n\nIn order to understand, change, expand, and improve context, you have to\nengage in dialogue and discussion, which is different from issuing decrees\nthat come from one person who is supposed to know it all.\n\nContext can make us look for the right question instead of looking for the\nright answer. Examining context can force us to look closely at hidden\nunderlying assumptions. It forces us to take a different perspective.\n\nHere\u2019s how Wiley Souba puts it,\n\n> Often, we cannot change the content of our lives, But while we can\u2019t do much\n> about what we know, we can alter the way we know it. We have the freedom to\n> alter the way we distinguish the situations that occur in our lives; we can\n> shift the context.\n>\n> Content is always observed within a linguistic context, one created by\n> distinctions. Only by means of language can you and I lead ourselves, each\n> and every day, to become the wiser, more enlightened, and more evolved human\n> beings that we are intended to become.\n>\n> \u2013 Wiley Souba in The Being of Leadership [9]\n\nLeaders, who are masters at creating the right contexts, know that language is\nconstitutive and can actively shape the meaning of a given situation.\n\nThe next time we find ourselves in a sticky leadership situation or when\nconsidering a rollout of a new, tough initiative, instead of charging in\nheadlong and engaging with the contents of the situation, perhaps we should\nconsider what the context is and how we can leverage that.\n\nAntoine De Saint-Exupery said it best:\n\n> If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the people to gather wood, divide\n> the work, and give orders.Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and\n> endless sea.\n\nPut simply, leadership is a context sport.\n\n\ud83d\udca1\n\nLiking this article?
