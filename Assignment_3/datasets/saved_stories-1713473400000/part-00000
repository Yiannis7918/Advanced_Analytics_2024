In other words, it is a probabilistic extension to\nOWL that provides a framework for authoring probabilistic ontologies and is\nbased on the Bayesian first-order logic called Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks\n(MEBN).\n\n### A More Detailed Explanation\n\nUncertainty is ubiquitous. Any representation scheme intended to model real-\nworld actions and processes must be able to cope with the effects of uncertain\nphenomena.\n\nA major shortcoming of existing Semantic Web technologies is their inability\nto represent and reason about uncertainty in a sound and principled manner.\nThis not only hinders the realization of the original vision for the Semantic\nWeb, but also raises an unnecessary barrier to the development of new,\npowerful features for general knowledge applications.\n\nThe overall goal of our research is to establish a Bayesian framework for\nprobabilistic ontologies, providing a basis for plausible reasoning services\nin the Semantic Web. As an initial effort towards this broad objective, this\ndissertation introduces a probabilistic extension to the Web ontology language\nOWL, thereby creating a crucial enabling technology for the development of\nprobabilistic ontologies.\n\nThe extended language, PR-OWL (pronounced as \"prowl\"), adds new definitions to\ncurrent OWL while retaining backward compatibility with its base language.\nThus, OWL-built legacy ontologies will be able to interoperate with newly\ndeveloped probabilistic ontologies. PR-OWL moves beyond deterministic\nclassical logic (Frege, 1879; Peirce, 1885), having its formal semantics based\non MEBN probabilistic logic (Laskey, 2008).\n\nBy providing a means of modeling uncertainty in ontologies, PR-OWL will serve\nas a supporting tool for many applications that can benefit from probabilistic\ninference within an ontology language, thus representing an important step\ntoward the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) vision for the Semantic Web.\n\nIn addition, PR-OWL is suitable for a broad range of applications, which\nincludes improvements to current ontology solutions (i.e. by providing proper\nsupport for modeling uncertain phenomena) and much-improved versions of\nprobabilistic expert systems currently in use in a variety of domains (e.g.\nmedical, intelligence, military, etc).\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe first seed of PR-OWL began to grow in Paulo Costa's PhD Dissertation and\nit is currently a work in progress. Today, there are two teams working on\nparalel. The first team is headed by Prof. Kathryn B. Laskey, at George Mason\nUniversity'' C4I Center, which a focus on the semantics and logical framework\nunderlying the language. The second team has a focus on developing a MEBN\nreasoner for PR-OWL, based on the already successfull Bayesian Network package\nUNBBayes, an open source project led by Prof. Marcelo Ladeira, at the\nUniversity of Brasilia.\n\n### How to use this site?\n\nThe website is a collection of pages designed to help people to understand the\nconcept of a Bayesian ontology language as it is being developed. In addition\nto the pages directly related to PR-OWL, there is a substantial amount of\npages conveying background information, including probability theory, Bayesian\nNetworks, Web Languages, MEBN and others. Also, you will find references to\nmost of the work cited in the pages (usually in the bottom of each page), and\nlinks to relevant sources of information.\n\nBeginning in November 2006, we started a major overhaul of the PR-OWL web\nsite, fulfilling an old pledge for transforming it from a simple repository of\npapers and references to an actual tool for researchers and other people\ninterested in our work. However, due to extreme overload we failed to update\nthe site as fas as we would like to and it stayed most of the years 2008 to\n2010 unchanged. Now, starting from December 2010 we will be resuming the site\nconstruction and expect to reach a final configuration by July 2011.\n\nWe hope visiting our site becomes an enjoyable and useful experience, and\nencourage you to send feedback on how we might improve it.\n\nThanks!\n\nThe PR-OWL/MEBN/UnBBayes team\n\n### References\n\nCosta, Paulo C.
