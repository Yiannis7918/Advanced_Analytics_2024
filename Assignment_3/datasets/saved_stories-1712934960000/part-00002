We have some bad news. Roku, the kings of\nturning your idiot box into a smart one, is apparently developing a way to\nshow you ads on its TVs even when you're not using one of its streaming apps,\nLowpass reports.\n\nThat's right: whether you're using your gaming console or watching cable, this\npotential system could plaster an ad on top of whatever you're using your Roku\nTV to look at \u2014 so long as it's hooked up with an HDMI cable.\n\nAccording to a patent application filed in August and published in November,\nthe tech would shove ads onto your screen whenever it detects a break in\nactivity. Pause your game or movie, for example, and the Roku TV would seize\nthe moment to overlay a \"relevant ad.\"\n\nShould this actually be implemented, Roku will have finally conquered one of\nits major \"blind spots,\" as Lowpass puts it: until now, its TVs haven't been\nable to \"see\" what you're doing on your HDMI devices.\n\n## No Breaks\n\nDoes this all sound invasive? Wait till you hear how the Roku system sniffs\nout your pauses. As detailed in the patent, Roku wants to directly monitor the\nvideo signal being sent from your Blu-ray player or what-have-you into a Roku\nTV.\n\nThings like a static frame or a period of no audio would tell the system if\nthe video feed is paused. It could also potentially look for a pause symbol on\nthe screen. If your TV uses HDMI-CEC, a system that allows HDMI devices to be\ncontrolled by one remote, it could even detect when you hit the pause button.\n\nAs for the \"relevant ad\" part of the equation, the Roku TV would leverage\nwidely used content recognition technology to identify what's onscreen in,\nsay, a movie you're watching.\n\nFor example, once it detects the movie you're watching and the actors\ninvolved, it could also pick out metadata that \"may correspond to a champagne\nbottle and mountain scenery,\" the patent reads, per Lowpass. Then \"the\nrelevant ads may include the famous actor, a type of champagne, vacation\nopportunities that include the mountain scenery recognized.\"\n\nAnd boom, a targeted ad is remorselessly delivered straight to your screen and\nyour unwitting eyeballs, whether you like it or not.\n\n## Patently Ridiculous\n\nThis is pretty galling stuff. Still, as bad as it sounds, it's not that\nunusual as far as corporate patents go.\n\nHuge companies will often file patents for outlandish concepts \u2014 like that one\nSony filed that would have customers yell a brand's name to skip ads \u2014 that\nthey may not intend to use, simply as a way of ensuring their competition\ncan't leverage those ideas in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, we wouldn't put it past Roku \u2014 or any big tech company \u2014 to\nactually implement something as invasive as this.\n\nAs Lowpass notes, Roku is pretty greedy when it comes to advertising. Last\nyear, it allowed big brands to buy ad slots that show on its iconic Roku City\nscreensaver.
