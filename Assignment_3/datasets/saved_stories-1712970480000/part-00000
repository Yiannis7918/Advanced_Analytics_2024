tube.(Supplied:Via\nReuters)\n\nabc.net.au/news/china-ultra-high-speed-trains-maglev-how-fast/103644930\n\nLink copied\n\nChina's new high-speed train doesn't roll along railways, it flies through\ntubes.\n\nThere are hopes it will one day connect cities and villages across the\ncountry, running at speeds of up to 4,000 kilometres per hour.\n\nThe magnetic-levitation (or maglev) train can clock speeds of 623 kph in tests\n\u2014 almost 200 kph quicker than the fastest train in service.\n\nIt is yet to be rolled out, but in February it went even faster, during a test\nof technology crucial to the train's high speed.\n\nFor the first time it travelled stably through the 2-kilometre low-vacuum\ntube, according to China's state run Aerospace Science and Industry\nCorporation (CASIC).\n\nCASIC is yet to reveal the speed it reached, but said it was faster than its\nprevious record of 623 kph.\n\n## How does the train go so fast?\n\nMagnets!\n\nThe train is moved and suspended above the ground using magnetic-levitation\ntechnology \u2014 basically using the push and pull forces of magnets to guide,\nspeed or slow the train.\n\nThis means the maglev train is much lighter, as it doesn't need wheels and\nbrakes and other heavy bits of engineered steel to keep it safely on a\nrailway.\n\nTo help keep friction down, China's latest superconducting maglev train is\nsuspended, using three types of magnets, in a low-vacuum pipeline to \"fly\".\n\nThis generation is designed to reach up to 1,000 kph \u2014 faster than most people\nwill ever travel on an airplane.\n\nUnless you're Taylor Swift, whose private jet can still outpace the maglev\ntrain ... just.\n\nMaglev trains don't have wheels and don't need traditional railway\ntracks.(AFP: cnsphoto/Imaginechina)\n\n## What are the main challenges?\n\nUK high-speed rail expert Professor Andrew McNaughton told the ABC there were\nseveral difficulties in building large maglev networks.\n\nFirstly, all new infrastructure, like the low-vacuum tunnel in China, has to\nbe built and no older trains or railways are compatible.\n\n### Will hyperloops ever happen?\n\nWill we ever really be able to zip between cities in a speeding metal pod?\n\nRead more\n\nSecondly, the energy requirement is \"very substantial\", Professor McNaughton\nsaid.\n\n\"The third is that the volume of people between just two destinations is\ninsufficient to justify the cost \u2014 unless it is two mega cities,\" he\nexplained.\n\n\"Various studies have suggested that the construction and operational cost of\nmaglev is probably four to five times that of a conventional high-speed\nrailway.\"\n\nBecause of the velocities involved, noise is a big problem and means\nadditional measures, like expensive tunnels and sound barriers, would need to\nbe installed around communities.\n\n\"Lastly, whilst a maglev can operate around 500 kph compared with a\nconventional high-speed train at 350kph, the time saved \u2014 unless over a very\nlong distance \u2014 is not huge and certainly not enough to justify the cost,\"\nProfessor McNaughton said.\n\n## How will a train this fast change things?\n\nCommuters can come into cities from further away, and the increased speed of\nlogistics will be a boon for most businesses.\n\nBecause the train is capable of going up to 1,000 kph, there are other\npositives too.\n\nWhen that kind of speed can be reached, trains can basically compete with\nplanes.\n\nChina hopes its maglev trains will reach 4,000 kilometres per hour \u2014far\nexceeding the top speed of the Concorde supersonic passenger jet.(Flickr:\nDeanster1983)\n\nA train capable of the high-speeds China is aiming for would likely have a big\nimpact for a large country, said associate professor Jonathan Couldrick from\nthe ANU College of Engineering, Computing and Cybernetics.\n\n\"Imagine commuting 400 kilometres in around half an hour \u2014 that would be a\ngame changer for the population centres,\" he told the ABC.\n\n\"And so you can actually have growth areas away from the capital cities, and\npeople commute in in the morning.\"\n\nMr Couldrick said the fast trains could also be better for the environment.\n\nHe has estimated that completely replacing regional passenger aircraft with\nultra-high-speed trains in some countries where people have to travel vast\ndistances could reduce carbon emissions by 3 or 4 per cent.\n\nDesigners want to push the limits of the train and Mao Kai, the technical\nchief of the project, told Chinese media it could ultimately reach a\nblistering 4,000 kph.\n\nThat's even faster than the record 3,529.6 kph reached in 1976 by the almighty\nSR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft \u2014 the fastest manned aircraft in\nhistory.\n\n## How does it compare to other high-speed trains?\n\nIn places like Japan and France, high-speed trains have been around for\ndecades.\n\nSince 2010, about 10 countries have developed high-speed trains \u2014 ones that\ncan travel more than 250 kph.\n\nThe TGV train hurtles through France on its way to setting a speed record of\n574.8km/h.(Vincent Kessler: Reuters.)\n\nBut they run on railways and can't achieve speeds much beyond 350 kph, railway\nexpert Associate Professor Philip Laird from the University of Wollongong told\nthe ABC.\n\nExcept for the TGV in France, which holds the record for the fastest\ncommercial train on steel wheels.\n\nIn special test conditions, a modified version can race along at 574.8 kph,\nbut with passengers aboard it usually operates at speeds of about 320 kph.\n\nThe Shanghai maglev currently holds the record for the fastest train in\nservice.\n\nAt 460 kph, the 30-kilometre journey between Shanghai's Pudong airport and\nLongyang Road station takes only about seven and a half minutes.\n\nMaglev trains like this one in Japan float above the track and have no wheels,\nso they have less friction and are lighter than conventional trains.(AFP\nPhoto: Jiji Press)\n\nJapan's fastest bullet train can hit a maximum speed of about 320 kph, Dr\nLaird said.\n\nBut Japan also has a 42-kilometre test track on which it has run a maglev\ntrain at 503 kph, but that train is not expected to be in service until 2030\nat the earliest, according to Dr Laird.\n\nWhen Japan's new generation of maglev trains rolls out, they are expected to\nrun at maximum speeds of 500 kph between Tokyo and Nagoya.\n\nIn October, Indonesia unveiled a high-speed railway that runs for about 150\nkilometres between Jakarta and Bandung.\n\nWith maximum speeds of 350kph, the Whoosh is the fastest railway line in\nSouth-East Asia and was built by China at a cost of about $7.65 billion.\n\nIndia has also been hard at work building a high-speed train between Mumbai\nand Ahmedabad.\n\nIt is due to be opened by 2027, Dr Laird said.\n\n## Could maglev connect Australia's distant cities?\n\nAustralia has been looking at connecting cities with high-speed rail for about\n40 years.\n\nDespite the huge costs involved with acquiring land and building the network,\nthe High Speed Rail Authority (HSRA) was created last June to take the idea\nfrom paper to reality.\n\nThe federal government has also committed almost $80 million to the greatly\nanticipated high-speed rail line from Sydney to Newcastle.\n\n### Sydney to Newcastle high-speed rail funding\n\nAdvocates welcome federal funding for a high-speed rail business case, but\nupgrades to the existing line must also be prioritised in the meantime.\n\nRead more\n\nWhether they would be keen to take it a step further and build a maglev rail\nremains to be seen, but Dr Couldrick is sceptical.\n\nHe estimated the cost to construct a maglev system in Australia would be,\nconservatively, about $1,000 per metre.\n\n\"That's $1 million per kilometre,\" he said.\n\n\"The cost\u2013benefit may not be there\"\n\nDr Laird said he was optimistic Australia would one day have a high-speed rail\nnetwork, but it would take a while to construct.\n\nHe also was unsure about the likelihood of a maglev system but believes a\nhigh-speed rail network could be built incrementally.\n\n\"This has been the case in Japan \u2014 it started off with just over 500\nkilometres (of high-speed railway lines) in 1964,\" he said.\n\n\"Now they have about 3,000 kilometres.\"\n\nProfessor McNaughton said the only place where a maglev would make sense would\nbe between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nBut, because maglev needs entirely new infrastructure and cannot run on\nexisting lines while its dedicated track is built, the whole network would\nhave to be completed before the first train could run.\n\n\"That's one heck of an infrastructure project,\" he said.\n\n\"If there are barely enough people travelling to justify high-speed rail \u2014\nfour planes an hour is one high-speed train, really \u2014 then justifying maglev\nat several times the cost isn't going to be remotely likely.\"\n\nPosted Yesterday at 6:48pmThu 11 Apr 2024 at 6:48pm, updated 19h ago19 hours\nagoFri 12 Apr 2024 at 12:51am\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n  * Facebook\n  * X
