The article suggested that getting\nrid of Section 230 \u201ccould save everything.\u201d Yet the article was so far off-\nbase that it was in the \u201cnot even wrong\u201d category of wrongness.\n\nI\u2019m not going to review all the reasons it was wrong. You can go back to my\noriginal article for that, though I will note that the argument seemed to\nsuggest that getting rid of Section 230 would both lead to better content\nmoderation and, at the same time, only moderation based on the First\nAmendment. Both of those points are obviously wrong, but the latter one is\nincoherent.\n\nGiven his long track record of wrongness, I had assumed that much of the\narticle likely came from Lanier. However, I\u2019m going to reassess that in light\nof Stanger\u2019s recent performance before the House Energy & Commerce Committee.\nLast week, there was this weird hearing about Section 230, in which the\nCommittee invited three academic critics of Section 230, and not a single\nperson who could counter their arguments and falsehoods. We talked about this\nhearing a bit in this week\u2019s podcast, with Rebecca MacKinnon from the\nWikimedia Foundation.\n\nStanger was one of the three witnesses. The other two, Mary Anne Franks and\nMary Graw Leary, presented some misleading and confused nonsense about Section\n230. However, the misleading and confused nonsense about Section 230 at least\nfits into the normal framework of the debate around Section 230. There is\nconfusion about how (c)(1) and (c)(2) interact, the purpose of Section 230,\nand (especially) some confusion about CSAM and Section 230 and an apparent\nunawareness that federal criminal behavior is exempted from Section 230.\n\nBut, let\u2019s leave that aside. Because Stanger\u2019s submission was so far off the\nmark that whoever invited her should be embarrassed. I\u2019ve seen some people\ntestify before Congress without knowing what they\u2019re talking about, but I\ncannot recall seeing testimony this completely, bafflingly wrong before. Her\nsubmitted testimony is wrong in all the ways that the Wired article was wrong\nand more. There are just blatant factual errors throughout it.\n\nIt is impossible to cover all of the nonsense, so we\u2019re just going to pick\nsome gems.\n\n> Without Section 230, existing large social media companies would have to\n> adapt. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, (DAOs) such as BlueSky and\n> Mastodon, would become more attractive. The emergent DAO social media\n> landscape should serve to put further brakes on virality, allowing a more\n> regional social media ecosystem to emerge, thereby creating new demand for\n> local media. In an ideal world, networks of DAOs would comprise a new\n> fediverse (a collection of social networking servers which can communicate\n> with each other, while remaining independently controlled), where users\n> would have greater choice and control over the communities of which they are\n> a part.\n\nSo, um. That\u2019s not what DAOs are, professor. You seem to be confusing\ndecentralized social media with decentralized autonomous organizations, which\nare a wholly different thing. This is kind of like saying \u201csocial security\nbenefits\u201d when you mean \u201csocial media influencers\u201d because both begin with\n\u201csocial.\u201d They\u2019re not the same thing.\n\nA decentralized social media site is what it says on the tin. It\u2019s a type of\nsocial media that isn\u2019t wholly controlled by a single company. Different bits\nof it can be controlled by others, whether its users or alternative third-\nparty providers. A DAO is an operation, often using mechanisms like\ncryptocurrency and tokens, to enable a kind of democratic voting, or\n(possibly) a set of smart contracts, that determine how the loosely defined\norganization is run. They are not the same.\n\nIn theory, a decentralized social media site could be run by a DAO, but I\ndon\u2019t know of any that currently are.\n\nAlso, um, decentralized social media can only really exist because of Section\n230. \u201cWithout Section 230,\u201d you wouldn\u2019t have Bluesky or Mastodon, because\nthey would face ruinous litigation for hosting content that people would sue\nover. So, no, you would not have either more decentralized social media (which\nI think is what you meant) or DAOs (which are wholly unrelated). You\u2019d have a\nlot less, because hosting third-party speech would come with way more\nliability risk.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s nothing inherent to decentralized social media that means you\u2019d\n\u201cput the brakes on virality.\u201d Mastodon has developed to date in a manner\ndesigned to tamp down virality, but Bluesky hasn\u2019t? Nor have other\ndecentralized social media offerings, many of which hope to serve a global\nconversation where virality is a part of it. And that wouldn\u2019t really change\nwith or without Section 230. Mastodon made that decision because of the types\nof communities it wanted to foster. And, indeed, its ability to do that is, in\npart, due to intermediary liability protections like Section 230, that enable\nthe kind of small, more focused community moderation Mastodon embraces\nalready.\n\nIt\u2019s really not clear to me that Professor Stanger even knows what Section 230\ndoes.\n\n> Non-profits like Wikipedia are concerned that their enterprise could be shut\n> down through gratuitous defamation lawsuits that would bleed them dry until\n> they ceased to exist (such as what happened with Gawker). I am not convinced\n> this is a danger for Wikipedia, since their editing is done by humans who\n> have first amendment rights, and their product is not fodder for\n> virality....\n\nAgain, wut? The fact that their editing is \u201cdone by humans\u201d has literally no\nimpact on anything here. Why even mention that? Humans get sued for defamation\nall the time. And, if they\u2019re more likely to get sued for defamation, they\u2019re\nless likely to even want to edit at all.\n\nAnd people get mad about their Wikipedia articles all the time, and sometimes\nthey sue over them. Section 230 gets those lawsuits thrown out. Without it,\nthose lawsuits would last longer and be more expensive.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not at all clear if Prof. Stanger even knows what Section 230 is\nor how it works.\n\n> The Facebook Files show that Meta knew that its engagement algorithms had\n> adverse effects on the mental health of teenage girls, yet it has done\n> nothing notable to combat those unintended consequences. Instead, Meta\u2019s\n> lawyers have invoked Section 230 in lawsuits to defend itself against\n> efforts to hold it liable for serious harms\n\nAgain, this is just wrong. What the crux of the Facebook Files showed was that\nMeta was, in fact, doing research to learn about where its algorithms might\ncause harm in order to try to minimize that harm. However, because of some bad\nreporting, it now means that companies will be less likely to even do that\nresearch, because people like Professor Stanger will misrepresent it, claiming\nthat they did nothing to try to limit the harms. This is just outright false\ninformation.\n\nAlso, the cases where Meta has invoked Section 230 would be unrelated to the\nissue being discussed here because 230 is about not being held liable for user\ncontent.\n\n> The online world brought to life by Section 230 now dehumanizes us by\n> highlighting our own insignificance.

People\nwere a lot more \u201cinsignificant\u201d pre-internet, when they had no way to speak\nout. And what does \u201ccancel culture\u201d have to do with literally any of this?\n\n> Without Section 230, companies would be liable for the content on their\n> platforms.

Think of all the economic activity if we just\nbreak all the windows in our village!\n\nAgain and again, it becomes clear that Stanger has no clue how any of this\nworks. She does not understand Section 230. She does not understand the\ninternet. She does not understand the First Amendment. And she does not\nunderstand content moderation. It\u2019s a hell of a thing, considering she is\ntestifying about Section 230 and its impact on social media and the First\nAmendment.\n\n> At a stroke, content moderation for companies would be a vastly simpler\n> proposition. They need only uphold the First Amendment, and the Courts would\n> develop the jurisprudence to help them do that, rather than to put the onus\n> of moderation entirely on companies.\n\nThat is... not at all how it would work. They don\u2019t just need to \u201cuphold the\nFirst Amendment\u201d (which is not a thing that companies can even do). The First\nAmendment\u2019s only role is in restricting the government, not companies, from\npassing laws that infringe on a person\u2019s ability to express themselves.\n\nInstead, as has been detailed repeatedly, companies would face the so-called\n\u201cmoderator\u2019s dilemma.\u201d Because the First Amendment requires distributors to\nhave actual knowledge of content violating the law to be liable, a world\nwithout Section 230 would incentivize one of two things, neither of which is\n\u201cupholding the First Amendment.\u201d They would either let everything go and do as\nlittle moderation as possible (so as to avoid the requisite knowledge), or\nthey\u2019d become very aggressive in limiting and removing content to avoid\nliability (even though this wouldn\u2019t work and they\u2019d still get hit with tons\nof lawsuits).\n\n> We\u2019ve been here before. When government said the American public owned the\n> airwaves, so television broadcasting would be regulated, they put in place\n> regulations that supported the common good. The Internet affects everyone,\n> and our public square is now virtual, so we must put in place measures to\n> ensure that our digital age public dialogue includes everyone. In the\n> television era, the fairness doctrine laid that groundwork. A new lens needs\n> to be developed for the Internet age.\n\nExcept, no, that\u2019s just factually wrong. The only reason that the government\nwas able to put regulations on broadcast television was because the government\ncontrolled the public spectrum which they licensed to the broadcasters. The\nSupreme Court made clear in Red Lion that without that, they could not hinder\nthe speech of media companies. So, the idea that you can just apply similar\nregulations to the internet is just fundamentally clueless. The internet is\nnot publicly owned spectrum licensed to anyone.\n\n> While Section 230 perpetuates an illusion that today\u2019s social media\n> companies are common carriers like the phone companies, they are not. Unlike\n> Ma Bell, they curate the content they transmit to users\n\nAgain, it appears the Professor is wholly unaware of Section 230 and how it\nworks. The authors of Section 230 made it clear over and over again that they\nwrote 230 to be the opposite of common carriers. No one who supports Section\n230 thinks it makes platforms into common carriers, because it does not. The\nentire point was to free up companies to choose how to curate content, so as\nto allow those companies to craft the kinds of communities they wanted. They\nonly people claiming the \u201cillusion\u201d of common carrierness are those who are\ntrying to destroy Section 230.\n\nSo there is no \u201cillusion\u201d here, unless you don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re\ntalking about.\n\n> The repeal of Section 230 would also be a step in the right direction in\n> addressing what are presently severe power imbalances between government and\n> corporate power in shaping democratic life. It would also shine a spotlight\n> on a globally disturbing fact: the overwhelming majority of global social\n> media is currently in the hands of one man (Mark Zuckerberg), while nearly\n> half the people on earth have a Meta account. How can that be a good thing\n> under any scenario for the free exchange of ideas?\n\nI mean, we agree that it\u2019s bad that Meta is so big. But if you remove Section\n230 (as Meta itself has advocated for!), you help Meta get bigger and harm the\ncompetition. Meta has a building full of lawyers. They can handle the\nonslaught of lawsuits that this would bring (as Stanger herself gleefully\ncheers on). It\u2019s everyone else, the smaller sites, such as the decentralized\nplayers (not DAOs) who would get destroyed.\n\nMastodon admins aren\u2019t going to be able to afford to pay to defend the\nlawsuits. Bluesky doesn\u2019t have a building full of lawyers. The big winner here\nwould be Meta. The cost to Meta of removing Section 230 is minimal. The cost\nto everyone trying to eat away at Meta\u2019s marketshare would be massive.\n\n> The new speech is governed by the allocation of virality in our virtual\n> public square.

Historically, most people had no\nway to get their message out at all. You could talk to your friends, family,\nco-workers, and neighbors, and that was about it. If you wanted to reach\nbeyond that small group, you required some large gatekeeper (a publisher, a TV\nor radio producer, a newspaper) to grant you access, which they refused for\nthe vast majority of people.\n\nThe internet flipped all that on its head, allowing anyone to effectively\nspeak to anyone. The reason we have algorithms is not \u201cSection 230\u201d and the\nalgorithms aren\u2019t \u201csetting the volume,\u201d they came in to deal with the simple\nfact that there\u2019s just too much information, and it was flooding the zone.\nPeople wanted to find information that was more relevant to them, and with the\namount of content available online, the only way to manage that was with some\nsort of algorithm.\n\nBut, again, the rise of algorithms is not a Section 230 issue, even though\nStanger seems to think it is.\n\n> Getting rid of the liability shield for all countries operating in the\n> United States would have largely unacknowledged positive implications for\n> national security, as well as the profit margins for US-headquartered\n> companies.

And it\u2019s already been noted, clearly, that the First\nAmendment protects American users of foreign apps.\n\nNo one is saying \u201cyou can\u2019t ban TikTok because of 230,\u201d they\u2019re saying \u201cyou\ncan\u2019t ban TikTok because of the First Amendment.\u201d The Supreme Court isn\u2019t\ngoing to magically reinvent long-standing First Amendment doctrine because 230\nis repealed. This is nonsense.\n\nAnd, we were just discussing what utter nonsense it is to claim that TikTok is\n\u201cdigital fentanyl\u201d so I won\u2019t even bother repeating that.\n\n> There might also be financial and innovation advantages for American\n> companies with this simple legislative act.

This is why internet companies already\nmoderate. Stanger\u2019s piece repeatedly seems to complain both about too little\nmoderation (electoral interference! Alex Jones!) and too much moderation\n(algorithms! dastardly Zuck deciding what I can read!).\n\nShe doesn\u2019t even seem to realize that her argument is self-contradictory.\n\nBut, here, the supposed \u201cfinancial and innovation advantages\u201d from American\ncompanies being able to get \u201creputational gains\u201d by stopping \u201cmisinformation\u201d\nalready exists. And it only exists because of Section 230. Which Professor\nStanger is saying we need to remove to get the very thing it enables, and\nwhich would be taken away if it were repealed.\n\nThis whole thing makes me want to bang my head on my desk repeatedly.\n\nCompanies moderate today to (1) make users\u2019 experience better and (2) to make\nadvertisers happier that they\u2019re not facing brand risk from having ads appear\nnext to awful content. The companies that do better already achieve that\n\u201creputational benefit,\u201d and they can do that kind of moderation because they\nknow Section 230 prevents costly, wasteful, vexatious litigation from getting\ntoo far.\n\nIf you remove Section 230, that goes away. As discussed above, companies then\nare much more limited in the kinds of moderation they can do, which means\nusers have a worse experience and advertisers have a worse experience, leading\nto reputational harm.\n\nToday, companies already try to remove or diminish the power of electoral\ninterference. That\u2019s a giant part of trust & safety teams\u2019 efforts. But they\ncan really only do it safely because of 230.\n\n> The attention-grooming model fostered by Section 230 leads to stupendous\n> quantities of poor-quality data.

Section 230 does not lead to an \u201cattention-grooming model.\u201d That\u2019s\njust how society works. And, then, when she says society must seek quality as\na whole, given how many people are online, the only way to do that is with\nalgorithms trying to make some sort of call on what is, and what is not,\nquality.\n\nThat\u2019s how this works.\n\nDoes she imagine that without Section 230, algorithms will go away, but good\nquality content will magically rise up? Because that\u2019s not how any of this\nactually works.\n\nAgain, there\u2019s much more in her written testimony, and none of it makes any\nsense at all.\n\nHer spoken testimony was just as bad. Rep. Bob Latta asked her about the\nnational security claims (some of which were quoted above) and we got this\nword salad, none of which has anything to do with Section 230:\n\n> I think it\u2019s important to realize that our internet is precisely unique\n> because it\u2019s so open and that makes it uniquely vulnerable to all sorts of\n> cyber attacks.

This House right here. So I think\n> repealing Section 230 is connected to addressing a host of potential harms\n\nNothing mentioned in there \u2014 from supply chain attacks like xz utils, to a\npotential TikTok ban, to hackers breaking into hospitals \u2014 has anything\nwhatsoever to do with Section 230. She just throws it in at the end as if\nthey\u2019re connected.\n\nShe also claimed that Eric Schmidt has come out in favor of \u201crepealing Section\n230,\u201d which was news to me. It also appears to be absolutely false. I went and\nlooked, and the only thing I can find is a Digiday article which claims he\ncalled for reforms (not a repeal). The article never actually quotes him\nsaying anything related to Section 230 at all, so it\u2019s unclear what (if\nanything) he actually said. Literally the only quotes from Schmidt are old man\nstuff about how the kids these days just need to learn how to put down their\nphones, and then something weird about the fairness doctrine. Not 230.\n\nLater, in the hearing, she was asked about the impact on smaller companies\n(some of which I mentioned above) and again demonstrates a near total\nignorance of how this all works:\n\n> There is some concern, it\u2019s sometimes expressed from small businesses that\n> they are going to be the subject of frivolous lawsuits, defamation lawsuits,\n> and they can be sued out of business even though they\u2019ve defamed no one. I\u2019m\n> less concerned about that because if we were to repeal section (c)(1) of\n> Section 230 of those 26 words, I think the First Amendment would govern and\n> we would develop the jurisprudence to deal with small business in a more\n> refined way. I think if anything, small businesses are in a better position\n> to control and oversee what\u2019s on their platforms than these monolithic large\n> companies we have today. So with a bit of caution, I think that could be\n> addressed.\n\nThe First Amendment always governs. But Section 230 is the \u201cmore refined way\u201d\nthat we\u2019ve developed to help protect small businesses. The main function of\nSection 230 is to get cases, that would be long and costly if you had to\ndefend them under the First Amendment, tossed out much earlier at the motion\nto dismiss stage. Literally that\u2019s Section 230\u2019s main purpose.\n\nIf you had to fight it out under the First Amendment, you\u2019re talking about\nhundreds of thousands of dollars and a much longer case. And that cost is\ngoing to lead companies to (1) refuse to host lots of protected content,\nbecause it\u2019s not worth the hassle, and (2) be much more open to pulling down\nany content that anyone complains about.\n\nThis is not speculative. There have been studies on this. Weaker intermediary\nlaws always lead to massive overblocking. If Stanger had done her research, or\neven understood any of this, she would know this.\n\nSo why is she the one testifying before Congress?\n\nI\u2019ll just conclude with this banger, which was her final statement to\nCongress:\n\n> I just want to maybe take you back to the first part of your question to\n> explain that, which I thought was a good one, which is that we have a long\n> history of First Amendment jurisprudence in this country that in effect has\n> been stopped by Section 230. In other words, if you review, if you remove\n> (c)(1), that First Amendment jurisprudence will develop to determine when it\n> is crime fire in a crowded theater, whether there\u2019s defamation, whether\n> there\u2019s libel. We believe in free speech in this country, but even the First\n> Amendment has some limits put on it and those could apply to the platforms.\n> We have a strange situation right now if we take that issue of fentanyl that\n> we were discussing earlier, what we have right now is essentially a system\n> where we can go after the users, we can go after the dealers, but we can\u2019t\n> go after the mules. And I think that\u2019s very problematic. We should hold the\n> mules liable. They\u2019re part of the system.\n\nYeah. So. She actually went to the whole fire in a crowded theater thing. This\nis the dead-on giveaway that the person speaking has no clue about the First\nAmendment. That\u2019s dicta from a case from over 100 years ago, in a case that is\nno longer considered good law, and hasn\u2019t been in decades. Even worse, that\ndicta came in a case about jailing war protestors.\n\nShe also trots out yet another of Ken \u201cPopehat\u201d White\u2019s (an actual First\nAmendment expert) most annoying tropes about people opining on the First\nAmendment without understanding it: because the First Amendment has some\nlimits, this new limit must be okay. That\u2019s not how it works. As Ken and\nothers have pointed out, the exceptions to the First Amendment are an\nestablished, known, and almost certainly closed set.\n\nThe Supreme Court has no interest in expanding that set. It refused to do so\nfor animal crush videos, so it\u2019s not going to magically do it for whatever\nawful speech you think it should limit.\n\nAnyway, it was a shame that Congress chose to hold a hearing on Section 230\nand only bring in witnesses who hate Section 230. Not a single witness who\ncould explain why Section 230 is so important was brought in. But, even worse,\nthey gave one of the three witness spots to someone who was spewing word salad\nlevel nonsense, that didn\u2019t make any sense at all, was often factually\nincorrect (in hilariously embarrassing ways), and seemed wholly unaware of how\nany relevant thing worked.\n\nDo better, Congress.\n\nFiled Under: 1st amendment, advertising, algorithms, allison stanger, content\nmoderation, hearings, house energy and commerce committee, intermediary\nliability, mary graw leary, section 230\n\n8 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * Sextortion Is A Real & Serious Criminal Issue; Blaming Section 230 For It Is Not\n  * Kansas Reflector Mostly Admits That Meta\u2019s Blocking Of Their Site Wasn\u2019t Deliberate\n  * The Motion Picture Association Doesn\u2019t Get To Decide Who The First Amendment Protects\n  * Will Elon Sue?

I have almost reached the regrettable\nconclusion that the Negro\u2019s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom\nis not the White Citizen\u2019s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white\nmoderate, who is more devoted to \u201corder\u201d than to justice; who prefers a\nnegative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is\nthe presence of justice; who constantly says: \u201cI agree with you in the goal\nyou seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\u201d; who\npaternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man\u2019s freedom;\nwho lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro\nto wait for a \u201cmore convenient season.\u201d Shallow understanding from people of\ngood will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of\nill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright\nrejection.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 19, 2024 at 10:03 am\n\n# Re:\n\nModern liberals would be writing off MLK as a \u201cright-wing troll.\u201d\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nSamuel Abram (profile) says:\n\nApril 19, 2024 at 10:28 am\n\nI\u2019m not sure whether Allison Stranger\u2019s testimony indicates that she\u2019s\nextremely and willfully ignorant or is extremely and willfully mendacious.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nStephen T.

I brought my telescope which made me popular, and it was great letting other people look through it\n  * John Roddy: It was so overcast for me that I legit couldn't even see clouds.\n  * mildconcern: I wasn't really aiming to take pictures primarily but I did get a few\n  * John Roddy: Just a perfectly homogenous gray.\n  * mildconcern: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo...\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo_1bvI0S/?igsh=cW85dnc5czF4Zzg4\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n  * deadspatula: Fascinatingly, the big advancement has been in better dosing, not simply the size of components. The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over. That certainly has helped the field of astronomical detection quite a bit.\n  * Digital sensors that had laughable resolution used to cost a fortune in the 1990s when they started to come out. And now you can get miracle devices for far less.\n  * John Roddy: Cell phone stuff is all in the microwave range.\n  * That's most useful for detecting the cosmic microwave background, which is probably the closest thing to a natural encyclopedia we're ever going to get.\n  * mildconcern: phone cameras also do sense visual light\n  * John Roddy: I feel like everyone I tell this to is hearing it for the first time, but...\n  * I *thought* it was common knowledge that your phone camera is pretty good at seeing infrared too.\n  * It's a really quick and easy way to check if a remote control is working.\n  * Infrared LEDs *will* be visible through the sensor.\n  * mildconcern: Oh yeah I knew that, I was just being a wiseass\n  * it's not hugely far in the infrared spectrum\n  * can't use it as a heat detector or something. Just a smidge.\n  * but I'm mostly saying in terms of astronomy applications. The overall success in designing sensors and detectors in smaller scales has hugely helped anyway\n  * no matter the wavelengths\n  * John Roddy: Yeah, the interesting stuff requires some pretty intense tech.\n  * Almost everything glows in the infrared spectrum, after all.\n  * mildconcern: It's a big part of why they stuck the JWT in space\n  * since it's mostly working in that range\n  * John Roddy: That's only half the story\n  * Spritzer needed some pretty extreme shielding too.\n  * Except the tech wasn't *quite* ready to make the active cooling reliable enough.\n  * A lot of people think of \"cold\" in terms of what chilly weather feels like on earth.\n  * The cold air sucks the heat right out of you.\n  * But space doesn't have that air.\n  * So despite space being extremely cold, it's actually really hard to cool things down out there.\n  * The reason the space shuttle always had the bay doors open in orbit is because that's where the radiators were.\n  * mildconcern: yeah. but the IR wavelengfths that JWT are detecting can't even get through at all even in Earth orbit\n  * so that's why it's out at the Lagrange Point\n  * Despite the \"can't fuck this one up and fix it later\" nature of that as opposed to Hubble\n  * John Roddy: It's not even *at* the Lagrange point\n  * It's in an orbit around it\n  * Samuel Abram: I took a screencap of a thread on facebook, to illustrate the necessity of checkmarks as verification and not a marker of a paid status.\n  * Unfortunately, I can't upload it here\n  * [link]\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17P1ICo5rwQcW4dnkY8KSX8XzdIXoSQZN/view?usp=drive_link\n\n  * John Roddy: Wow. I legit didn't even realize Lowery was still alive.\n  * He was a grumpy old man last time I encountered him years and years ago, after all.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yes, but he's just asking people to be more \"genuinely empathetic\" like the time he suggested I should get cancer and die in a fire.\n  * John Roddy: I don't know. His decision to back up the guy who compared Brian to Hitler kinda seems to undermine that a bit.\n  * mildconcern: \"Following that were screenshots of tweets (or whatever the fuck)\".

Especially as I see the enshittification of Google as (finally) a window of opportunity for others to step in\n  * John Roddy: Cloud powered AI cryptocurrency\n  * mildconcern: Yeah Google is so much easier to switch away from than a social network.\n  * I've been using Kagi for months now and haven't looked back. I tried DuckDuckGo and found that I often had to try Google when it failed. I haven't had to do the same with Kagi.\n  * Mike Masnick: kagi has been good for me too...\n  * Samuel Abram: It's just that Kagi costs money and google doesn't\n  * BentFranklin: That sounds great actually, considering what free gets you these days. Maybe someone can get Kagi added to this: [link]\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/wiki/index\n\n  * mildconcern: I found after trying it for a trial that it saved me more than enough in time to make up for the ten bucks a month.\n  * Worst comes to worse I'll just stop supporting those Techdirt cranks. *grins*\n  * Samuel Abram: That\u2019s fair\n  * Though if I were you, I\u2019d _never_ stop supporting these Techdirt cranks. Quality journalism is worth paying for.\n  * John Roddy: The post of Paxton complaining about the community note being wrong now has its own community note explaining how his explanation of it being wrong is wrong.\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah. I had sent that to @Tim Cushing earlier to check out. Hilarious.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder if Paxton'll retaliate against Elon and make him keep shopping for a state to reincorporate Tesla in\n  * John Roddy: Also I'm banned from submitting any community notes, apparently.\n  * As is anyone else who ever said the word \"cis\" in any context.\n  * candescence: I swear, Elon is the peak example of white male fragility\n  * Samuel Abram: So I guess you could never talk about Transalpine Gaul and [redacted]alpine Gaul, right?\n  * BentFranklin: ...or be a chemist\n  * mildconcern: or the loose trade alliance of former USSR republics\n\nBecome an Insider!\n\nRecent Stories\n\n## Friday  \n  \n---  \n10:54| The US Banning TikTok Would Play Right Into China\u2019s Hands, And Destroy\nDecades Of US Work On Promoting An Open Internet (1)  \n10:51| Daily Deal: The Ultimate Adobe CC Training Bundle (0)  \n09:26| Congressional Testimony On Section 230 Was So Wrong That It Should Be\nStruck From The Record (8)  \n05:26| Apple Praised For Repair Reforms Only Made Possible By New Oregon Law\nIt Tried To Kill (2)  \n  \n## Thursday  \n  \n20:45| UK Prosecutors Apologize For Pursuing BS Charges Against A Photographer\n(12)  \n15:32| Palworld Creator Loves That Others Are Trying To Clone The Game (14)  \n13:02| Sextortion Is A Real & Serious Criminal Issue; Blaming Section 230 For\nIt Is Not (25)  \n11:02| Cops Claim Body Cam Footage Of Wrong Address Raid Would Be 'Dangerous'\nTo Release To General Public (37)  \n10:57| Daily Deal: The Complete Cisco Training Bundle (0)  \n09:24| No, TikTok Is Not \u2018Programmable Fentanyl.'
