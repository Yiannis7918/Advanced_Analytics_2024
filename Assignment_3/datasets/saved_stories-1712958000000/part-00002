The growth in volume is shown in red while the\ngrowth in value is in yellow.\n\nConsequently, it threatens U.S. and EU firms which survive on profits rather\nthan what Western officials argue is a drip-feed of state resources in China.\nAnd, it can complicate longer-term investment decisions.\n\nGrowing numbers of loss-making manufacturers in China\n\nChina's industrial complex is expanding, but many firms cannot cope with the\nheightened competition.\n\nShare of\n\nloss-making\n\nenterprises\n\n40%\n\n500,000 units\n\n35\n\n400,000\n\n30\n\n25\n\n300,000\n\nNumber of\n\nindustrial\n\nenterprises\n\n20\n\n200,000\n\n15\n\n10\n\n100,000\n\nNumber of\n\nloss-making\n\nenterprises\n\n5\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2016\n\n2018\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\n2024\n\n2014\n\n2016\n\n2018\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\n2024\n\nNote: month-end data / January missing due to Lunar New Year holidays.\n\nGrowing numbers of loss-making manufacturers in China\n\nChina's industrial complex is expanding, but many firms cannot cope with the\nheightened competition.\n\nThe graphic has two charts next to each other.

That means no trade. Where would we be if there was no\ntrade?\"\n\nIt's not a new debate. More than a decade ago, Washington complained that the\nU.S. rust belt was crippled by Chinese overproduction of steel, which had\nforced China to dump it at very low prices.\n\nBut China can argue its output is more in tune with global demand than it was\nback then. China's inventory levels have ticked up during the COVID-hit years,\nbut remain well below levels seen in the 2010s.\n\nChina's inventories pick up pace\n\nInventory levels in China are picking up but still remain much lower than the\nhistorical norm.\n\nInventories as a percentage of GDP\n\n18%\n\n17\n\n16\n\n15\n\n14\n\n13.6%\n\n13\n\n12\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\n2016\n\n2018\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\nChina's inventories pick up pace\n\nInventory levels in China are picking up but still remain much lower than the\nhistorical norm.\n\nThe graphic is a line chart showing inventories as a percentage of the GDP in\nChina between 2004 and 2022.\n\nChina views the \"new three\" industries of electric vehicles, batteries and\nsolar power as key for its development.\n\nIn 2023, exports of the \"new three\" totalled 1.06 trillion yuan ($146.6\nbillion), up 29.9% year-on-year, official data showed. But they accounted for\nonly 4.5% of China's total yuan-denominated exports last year, so those on\nBeijing's side of the debate see the West's focus on them as hypocritical.\n\n\"U.S. and Europe have a bit of a gangster logic,\" said Wang Jun, chief\neconomist at Huatai Asset Management.\n\nIn the automotive sector, China argues overcapacity is concentrated in\ncombustion-engine cars rather than EVs and says market mechanisms will\neventually weed out weak players.\n\nMoreover, some models by Chinese EV maker BYD sell in Germany for more than\ndouble their price in China - an argument that critics use against Europe's\nconcerns over unfair pricing.\n\nCapacity utilisation of top NEV brands\n\nCapacity and production of vehicles in 2023\n\nCapacity over two shifts\n\nTotal units produced\n\nBYD\n\nSAIC GM Wuling*\n\nGreat Wall Motor*\n\nSAIC Motor Passenger Vehicle*\n\nGAC AION\n\nSAIC VW MEB EV factory\n\n1 mln\n\n4 mln\n\n0 mln units\n\n2 mln\n\n3 mln\n\nNotes:\n\n1\\.
