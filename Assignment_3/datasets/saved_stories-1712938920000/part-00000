Wikimedia Commons\n\nSamsung's Try Galaxy app now lets you experience the latest AI features of the\nGalaxy S24, even if you are using an iPhone or another Android phone.Previou\nsly limited to iOS devices, the Try Galaxy app is now available on all Android\nphones, allowing you to experience the latest Galaxy features without needing\na Galaxy phone.\n\nYou can experience the power of Galaxy AI on your Android phone by downloading\nthe Try Galaxy app. The app will allow you to explore exciting features like\nLive Translate, Chat Assist, Note Assist, Photo Assist and Circle to Search,\nall designed to offer Galaxy owners a whole new level of functionality.\n\nThe updated Try Galaxy app lets you experience the look and feel of the Galaxy\nS24's home screen. You can refer to tutorials and interactive content to learn\nmore about the new features.\n\nThe second page of the home screen features a widget that introduces the core\nAI-powered features of the Galaxy S24 series and its impressive camera setup.\nBy tapping each item, you can watch short demonstration videos that divulge\nkey details about the features and demonstrate their multiple use cases.\n\nThe app conveniently tracks your progress by marking completed items with\ncheck marks. The widget showcases these new AI-powered features:\n\n## Live Translate\n\nLive Translate, as the name suggests, bridges language barriers in real time\nusing AI. Galaxy AI will translate messages and conversations into your\npreferred language, whether you are texting or on a call.\n\n\"Effortlessly get in touch with a ride-share driver or make a restaurant\nreservation in a foreign country with voice and text translations of phone\ncalls, supported in 13 languages,\" the company noted in a blog post on the\nSamsung Newsroom UK website.\n\n## Note Assist\n\nSamsung's AI assistant in the Notes app does the hard work for you by\nautomatically formatting your notes. The technology is also capable of\ncorrecting typos and translating sections on the fly. It even shortens lengthy\nparagraphs into clear, scannable bullet points.\n\n## Chat Assist\n\nGalaxy AI can come in handy for those who struggle to craft the perfect tone\nfor their emails, texts or documents. Chat Assist is designed to refine your\nwriting to achieve the right tone for various occasions, including\nprofessional and casual.\n\n\"Send polished meeting agendas to the boss, and chat with international\nfriends in Spanish. The AI built into the Samsung Keyboard can also translate\nmessages in real-time in 13 languages, so that users can communicate better\nacross cultural and language barriers,\" Samsung says.\n\n## Photo Assist\n\nWhile Google's Pixel series phones are usually associated with AI-powered\nphoto editing functionalities, Samsung is raising the bar. The Korean brand's\nnew Generative Edit tool allows you to magically resize, reposition, and even\nremove unwanted objects from photos.\n\nSamsung's technology intelligently fills in any gaps left behind, ensuring\nyour photos look natural and seamless, even after editing. Aside from this,\nthere's a new Erase Reflection tool that will help you get rid of unwanted\nshadows and light reflections from glass and water.\n\n## Circle to Search with Google\n\nSamsung has been sparing no effort to promote the Circle to Search feature\nlately. In addition to turning London's iconic Tube map into a giant Circle to\nSearch puzzle to mark a new era of Galaxy AI, the Korean tech giant painted\ngiant glowing circles across the clear skies above Table Mountain in Cape\nTown, South Africa.\n\nTo use the feature, you just need to draw a circle on your screen and Galaxy\nS24's AI will instantly launch a Google search for anything you see, be it\ntext, clothing, movie stills, celebrities, or practically anything else,\nwithout requiring you to switch apps.\n\nThe Try Galaxy app also allows you to experience the functionalities and\nfeatures of the latest Galaxy S24 series while giving you an overview of its\nadvanced camera system. Regrettably, you will not be able to directly\nexperience the superior camera hardware.\n\nNevertheless, the Try Galaxy app provides valuable insights and demonstrations\nto help you explore the potential of the Galaxy S24 lineup.\n\nRead more\n\nGalaxy AI To Turn Samsung Wearables Into An AI-Powered Health Assistant\n\nTimeline Speculation: When Will The Galaxy S24 Series Get Android 15 (One UI\n7) Update?\n\nSamsung Unleashes Bixby Voice Commands On The Galaxy S24\n\nSamsung\n\n\u00a9 Copyright IBTimes 2024.
