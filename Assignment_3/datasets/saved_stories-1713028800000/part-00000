The SEB industrial group, which\nhad expressed concern over the text, welcomed an exemption for non-stick pans.\n\nBy St\u00e9phane Mandard\n\nPublished on April 5, 2024, at 9:09 am (Paris)\n\nTime to 3 min.\n\nLire en fran\u00e7ais\n\n  * Share\n\n    * Share on Facebook\n    * Share by email\n    * Share on Linkedin\n\nSubscribers only\n\nOn the eve of the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale's examination of his proposed law aimed\nat protecting the French population from the risks associated with per- and\npolyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), Green MP for Gironde in southwest France,\nNicolas Thierry, called on his colleagues to \"take action in the face of a\nmajor health scandal, perhaps the largest mass pollution in our history.\"\n\nAfter a long day of debates primarily focused on the potential risks of this\ntext for French businesses, he could congratulate himself on a \"first\nimportant milestone\": The proposed law was adopted unanimously (186 votes for,\nnone against and 27 abstentions) on Thursday, April 4. The result was achieved\ndespite opposition from the government and SEB, the world leader in non-stick\nfrying pans, which managed to secure an exemption for kitchen utensils even\nthough the company is a heavy consumer and emitter of \"forever chemicals.\" \"I\nregret that the crass lobbying of one industrialist has been able to gain so\nmuch support from the majority, the far right and the far-right,\" lamented\nThierry. The text will now go through the S\u00e9nat.\n\nIts flagship measure will ban the manufacture, import and sale of products\ncontaining PFAS in France. The ban, effective January 1, 2026, rather than\n2025 as envisaged in the initial text, will prohibit three categories of\nconsumer goods: cosmetics, clothing textiles (excluding protective clothing\nfor security and civil protection workers) and ski waxes. All textiles will be\ncovered by the ban from January 1, 2030.\n\nRead more 'Forever pollution': Explore the map of Europe's PFAS contamination\n\nThe issue of food packaging, another major source of exposure to \"forever\nchemicals,\" was left out of the committee's deliberations. Instead, it was\ndeferred to forthcoming European regulations, which are expected to impose\nstricter regulations, similar to Denmark's existing ban on PFAS.\n\nAnother key aspect in the text is that lawmakers decided to apply the\n\"polluter pays\" principle. It involves imposing a fee on industries\nresponsible for pollution to be paid to water agencies across France that are\nconfronted with contamination problems.\n\n## Present in everyday objects\n\nTo better characterize the extent of the pollution and protect populations,\nthe text introduces the obligation to monitor the presence of \"forever\nchemicals\" in drinking water throughout the country. Today, the collection of\nthis data is mainly confined to regions with significant pollution incidents,\nsuch as in Rumilly (eastern France), known as the \"frying pan capital of the\nworld,\" and home to the historic Tefal factory. They're also recorded in the\n\"chemical valley,\" south of Lyon (southeast-central France), home to two major\nPFAS producers, Arkema and Daikin.\n\nYou have 53.77% of this article left to read.
