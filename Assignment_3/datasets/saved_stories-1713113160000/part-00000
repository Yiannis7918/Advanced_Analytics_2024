He also\nsaid that the internal culture at NPR had placed race and identity as\n\u201cparamount in nearly every aspect of the workplace.\u201d\n\nMr. Berliner\u2019s essay has ignited a firestorm of criticism of NPR on social\nmedia, especially among conservatives who have long accused the network of\npolitical bias in its reporting. Former President Donald J. Trump took to his\nsocial media platform, Truth Social, to argue that NPR\u2019s government funding\nshould be rescinded, an argument he has made in the past.\n\nNPR has forcefully pushed back on Mr. Berliner\u2019s accusations and the\ncriticism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to stand behind the exceptional work that our desks and shows do\nto cover a wide range of challenging stories,\u201d Edith Chapin, the\norganization\u2019s editor in chief, said in an email to staff on Tuesday. \u201cWe\nbelieve that inclusion \u2014 among our staff, with our sourcing, and in our\noverall coverage \u2014 is critical to telling the nuanced stories of this country\nand our world.\u201d Some other NPR journalists also criticized the essay publicly,\nincluding Eric Deggans, its TV critic, who faulted Mr. Berliner for not giving\nNPR an opportunity to comment on the piece.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Mr. Berliner expressed no regrets about\npublishing the essay, saying that he loved NPR and hoped to make it better by\nairing criticisms that have gone unheeded by leaders for years. He called NPR\na \u201cnational trust\u201d that people rely on for fair reporting and superb\nstorytelling.\n\n\u201cI decided to go out and publish it in hopes that something would change, and\nthat we get a broader conversation going about how the news is covered,\u201d Mr.\nBerliner said.\n\nHe said that he had not been disciplined by managers, though he said he\nreceived a note from his supervisor reminding him that NPR requires employees\nto clear speaking appearances and media requests with standards and media\nrelations. He said he didn\u2019t run his remarks to The New York Times by network\nspokespeople.\n\nWhen the hosts of NPR\u2019s biggest shows, including \u201cMorning Edition\u201d and \u201cAll\nThings Considered,\u201d convened on Wednesday afternoon for a long-scheduled meet-\nand-greet with the network\u2019s new chief executive, Katherine Maher,\nconversation soon turned to Mr. Berliner\u2019s essay, according to two people with\nknowledge of the meeting. During the lunch, Ms. Chapin told the hosts that she\ndidn\u2019t want Mr. Berliner to become a \u201cmartyr,\u201d the people said.\n\nMr. Berliner\u2019s essay also sent critical Slack messages whizzing through some\nof the same employee affinity groups focused on racial and sexual identity\nthat he cited in his essay. In one group, several staff members disputed Mr.\nBerliner\u2019s points about a lack of ideological diversity and said that efforts\nto recruit more people of color would make NPR\u2019s journalism better.\n\nOn Wednesday, staff members from \u201cMorning Edition\u201d convened to discuss the\nfallout from Mr. Berliner\u2019s essay. During the meeting, an NPR producer took\nissue with Mr. Berliner\u2019s argument for why NPR\u2019s listenership has fallen off,\ndescribing a variety of factors that have contributed to the change.\n\nMr. Berliner\u2019s remarks prompted vehement pushback from several news\nexecutives. Tony Cavin, NPR\u2019s managing editor of standards and practices, said\nin an interview that he rejected all of Mr. Berliner\u2019s claims of unfairness,\nadding that his remarks would probably make it harder for NPR journalists to\ndo their jobs.\n\n\u201cThe next time one of our people calls up a Republican congressman or\nsomething and tries to get an answer from them, they may well say, \u2018Oh, I read\nthese stories, you guys aren\u2019t fair, so I\u2019m not going to talk to you,\u2019\u201d Mr.\nCavin said.\n\nSome journalists have defended Mr. Berliner\u2019s essay. Jeffrey A. Dvorkin, NPR\u2019s\nformer ombudsman, said Mr. Berliner was \u201cnot wrong\u201d on social media. Chuck\nHolmes, a former managing editor at NPR, called Mr. Berliner\u2019s essay \u201cbrave\u201d\non Facebook.\n\nMr. Berliner\u2019s criticism was the latest salvo within NPR, which is no stranger\nto internal division. In October, Mr. Berliner took part in a lengthy debate\nover whether NPR should defer to language proposed by the Arab and Middle\nEastern Journalists Association while covering the conflict in Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to rely on an advocacy group\u2019s guidance,\u201d Mr. Berliner wrote,\naccording to a copy of the email exchange viewed by The New York Times. \u201cOur\njob is to seek out the facts and report them.\u201d The debate didn\u2019t change NPR\u2019s\nlanguage guidance, which is made by editors who weren\u2019t part of the\ndiscussion.\n\nMr. Berliner\u2019s public criticism has highlighted broader concerns within NPR\nabout the public broadcaster\u2019s mission amid continued financial struggles.\nLast year, NPR cut 10 percent of its staff and canceled four podcasts,\nincluding the popular \u201cInvisibilia,\u201d as it tried to make up for a $30 million\nbudget shortfall. Listeners have drifted away from traditional radio to\npodcasts, and the advertising market has been unsteady.\n\nIn his essay, Mr. Berliner laid some of the blame at the feet of NPR\u2019s former\nchief executive, John Lansing, who retired at the end of last year after four\nyears in the role. He was replaced by Ms. Maher, who started on March 25.\n\nDuring a meeting with employees in her first week, Ms. Maher was asked what\nshe thought about decisions to give a platform to political figures like Ronna\nMcDaniel, the former Republican Party chair whose position as a political\nanalyst at NBC News became untenable after an on-air revolt from hosts who\ncriticized her efforts to undermine the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cI think that this conversation has been one that does not have an easy\nanswer,\u201d Ms. Maher responded.\n\nBenjamin Mullin reports on the major companies behind news and entertainment.\nContact Ben securely on Signal at +1 530-961-3223 or email at\nbenjamin.mullin@nytimes.com.
