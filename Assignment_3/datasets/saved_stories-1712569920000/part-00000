supermassive black hole at the core of Messier 87^[1]\n\nAnimated simulation of a Schwarzschild black hole with a galaxy passing\nbehind. Around the time of alignment, extreme gravitational lensing of the\ngalaxy is observed.\n\nA black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing,\nincluding light and other electromagnetic waves, is capable of possessing\nenough energy to escape it.^[2] Einstein's theory of general relativity\npredicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black\nhole.^[3]^[4] The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. A black\nhole has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing\nit, but it has no locally detectable features according to general\nrelativity.^[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as\nit reflects no light.^[6]^[7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved\nspacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same\nspectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass.\nThis temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black\nholes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.\n\nObjects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were\nfirst considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon\nLaplace.^[8] In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of\ngeneral relativity that would characterize a black hole. David Finkelstein, in\n1958, first published the interpretation of \"black hole\" as a region of space\nfrom which nothing can escape. Black holes were long considered a mathematical\ncuriosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a\ngeneric prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by\nJocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed\ncompact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole\nknown was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in\n1971.^[9]^[10]\n\nBlack holes of stellar mass form when massive stars collapse at the end of\ntheir life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can grow by absorbing mass\nfrom its surroundings. Supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses\n(M_\u2609) may form by absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, or\nvia direct collapse of gas clouds. There is consensus that supermassive black\nholes exist in the centres of most galaxies.\n\nThe presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with\nother matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Any\nmatter that falls toward a black hole can form an external accretion disk\nheated by friction, forming quasars, some of the brightest objects in the\nuniverse. Stars passing too close to a supermassive black hole can be shredded\ninto streamers that shine very brightly before being \"swallowed.\"^[11] If\nother stars are orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine\nthe black hole's mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude\npossible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have\nidentified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems and\nestablished that the radio source known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of the\nMilky Way galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million\nsolar masses.\n\n## History\n\nThe idea of a body so big that even light could not escape was briefly\nproposed by English astronomical pioneer and clergyman John Michell in a\nletter published in November 1784. Michell's simplistic calculations assumed\nsuch a body might have the same density as the Sun, and concluded that one\nwould form when a star's diameter exceeds the Sun's by a factor of 500, and\nits surface escape velocity exceeds the usual speed of light. Michell referred\nto these bodies as dark stars.^[12] He correctly noted that such supermassive\nbut non-radiating bodies might be detectable through their gravitational\neffects on nearby visible bodies.^[8]^[13]^[14] Scholars of the time were\ninitially excited by the proposal that giant but invisible 'dark stars' might\nbe hiding in plain view, but enthusiasm dampened when the wavelike nature of\nlight became apparent in the early nineteenth century,^[15] as if light were a\nwave rather than a particle, it was unclear what, if any, influence gravity\nwould have on escaping light waves.^[8]^[14]\n\nThe modern theory of gravity, general relativity, discredits Michell's notion\nof a light ray shooting directly from the surface of a supermassive star,\nbeing slowed down by the star's gravity, stopping, and then free-falling back\nto the star's surface.^[16] Instead, spacetime itself is curved such that the\ngeodesic light travels on never leaves the surface of the \"star\" (black hole).\n\n### General relativity\n\nSee also: History of general relativity\n\nGeneral relativity  \n---  \n  \n  * Introduction\n  *     * History\n    * Timeline\n    * Tests\n  * Mathematical formulation\n\n  \nFundamental concepts\n\n  * Equivalence principle\n  * Special relativity\n  * World line\n  * Pseudo-Riemannian manifold\n\n  \nPhenomena|\n\n  * Kepler problem\n  * Gravitational lensing\n  * Gravitational red shift\n  * Gravitational time dilation\n  * Gravitational waves\n  * Frame-dragging\n  * Geodetic effect\n  * Event horizon\n  * Singularity\n  * Black hole\n\n  \n---  \nSpacetime  \n  \n  * Spacetime diagrams\n  * Minkowski spacetime\n  * Einstein\u2013Rosen bridge\n\n  \n  \n  * Equations\n  * Formalisms\n\n| Equations  \n---  \n  \n  * Linearized gravity\n  * Einstein field equations\n  * Friedmann\n  * Geodesics\n  * Mathisson\u2013Papapetrou\u2013Dixon\n  * Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Einstein\n\n  \nFormalisms  \n  \n  * ADM\n  * BSSN\n  * Post-Newtonian\n\n  \nAdvanced theory  \n  \n  * Kaluza\u2013Klein theory\n  * Quantum gravity\n\n  \n  \nSolutions\n\n  * Schwarzschild (interior)\n  * Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m\n  * G\u00f6del\n  * Kerr\n  * Kerr\u2013Newman\n  * Kerr\u2013Newman\u2013de Sitter\n  * Kasner\n  * Lema\u00eetre\u2013Tolman\n  * Taub\u2013NUT\n  * Milne\n  * Robertson\u2013Walker\n  * Oppenheimer\u2013Snyder\n  * pp-wave\n  * van Stockum dust\n  * Weyl\u2212Lewis\u2212Papapetrou\n\n  \nScientists\n\n  * Einstein\n  * Lorentz\n  * Hilbert\n  * Poincar\u00e9\n  * Schwarzschild\n  * de Sitter\n  * Reissner\n  * Nordstr\u00f6m\n  * Weyl\n  * Eddington\n  * Friedman\n  * Milne\n  * Zwicky\n  * Lema\u00eetre\n  * Oppenheimer\n  * G\u00f6del\n  * Wheeler\n  * Robertson\n  * Bardeen\n  * Walker\n  * Kerr\n  * Chandrasekhar\n  * Ehlers\n  * Penrose\n  * Hawking\n  * Raychaudhuri\n  * Taylor\n  * Hulse\n  * van Stockum\n  * Taub\n  * Newman\n  * Yau\n  * Thorne\n  * others\n\n  \n  \n  * Physics portal\n  * Category\n\n  \n  \n  * v\n  * t\n  * e\n\n  \n  \nIn 1915, Albert Einstein developed his theory of general relativity, having\nearlier shown that gravity does influence light's motion. Only a few months\nlater, Karl Schwarzschild found a solution to the Einstein field equations\nthat describes the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical\nmass.^[17]^[18] A few months after Schwarzschild, Johannes Droste, a student\nof Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave the same solution for the point mass\nand wrote more extensively about its properties.^[19]^[20] This solution had a\npeculiar behaviour at what is now called the Schwarzschild radius, where it\nbecame singular, meaning that some of the terms in the Einstein equations\nbecame infinite. The nature of this surface was not quite understood at the\ntime.\n\nIn 1924, Arthur Eddington showed that the singularity disappeared after a\nchange of coordinates, although it took until 1933 for Georges Lema\u00eetre to\nrealize that this meant the singularity at the Schwarzschild radius was a non-\nphysical coordinate singularity.^[21] Arthur Eddington did however comment on\nthe possibility of a star with mass compressed to the Schwarzschild radius in\na 1926 book, noting that Einstein's theory allows us to rule out overly large\ndensities for visible stars like Betelgeuse because \"a star of 250 million km\nradius could not possibly have so high a density as the Sun. Firstly, the\nforce of gravitation would be so great that light would be unable to escape\nfrom it, the rays falling back to the star like a stone to the earth.\nSecondly, the red shift of the spectral lines would be so great that the\nspectrum would be shifted out of existence. Thirdly, the mass would produce so\nmuch curvature of the spacetime metric that space would close up around the\nstar, leaving us outside (i.e., nowhere).\"^[22]^[23]\n\nIn 1931, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar calculated, using special relativity, that\na non-rotating body of electron-degenerate matter above a certain limiting\nmass (now called the Chandrasekhar limit at 1.4 M_\u2609) has no stable\nsolutions.^[24] His arguments were opposed by many of his contemporaries like\nEddington and Lev Landau, who argued that some yet unknown mechanism would\nstop the collapse.^[25] They were partly correct: a white dwarf slightly more\nmassive than the Chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a neutron star,^[26]\nwhich is itself stable. But in 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and others predicted\nthat neutron stars above another limit (the Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit)\nwould collapse further for the reasons presented by Chandrasekhar, and\nconcluded that no law of physics was likely to intervene and stop at least\nsome stars from collapsing to black holes.^[27] Their original calculations,\nbased on the Pauli exclusion principle, gave it as 0.7 M_\u2609; subsequent\nconsideration of neutron-neutron repulsion mediated by the strong force raised\nthe estimate to approximately 1.5 M_\u2609 to 3.0 M_\u2609.^[28] Observations of the\nneutron star merger GW170817, which is thought to have generated a black hole\nshortly afterward, have refined the TOV limit estimate to ~2.17\nM_\u2609.^[29]^[30]^[31]^[32]^[33] Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the\nsingularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that\nthis was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a valid point\nof view for external observers, but not for infalling observers. Because of\nthis property, the collapsed stars were called \"frozen stars\", because an\noutside observer would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the\ninstant where its collapse takes it to the Schwarzschild radius.^[34]\n\nAlso in 1939, Einstein would attempt to prove that black holes were impossible\nin his publication \"On a Stationary System with Spherical Symmetry Consisting\nof Many Gravitating Masses\", using his theory of general relativity to defend\nhis argument.^[35] Months later, Oppenheimer and his student Hartland Snyder\nwould provide the Oppenheimer\u2013Snyder model in their paper \"On Continued\nGravitational Contraction\",^[36] which predicted the existence of black holes.\nIn the paper, which made no reference to Einstein's recent publication,\nOppenheimer and Snyder used Einstein's own theory of general relativity to\nshow the conditions on how a black hole could develop for the first time in\ncontemporary physics .^[35]\n\n#### Golden age\n\nIn 1958, David Finkelstein identified the Schwarzschild surface as an event\nhorizon, \"a perfect unidirectional membrane: causal influences can cross it in\nonly one direction\".^[37] This did not strictly contradict Oppenheimer's\nresults, but extended them to include the point of view of infalling\nobservers. Finkelstein's solution extended the Schwarzschild solution for the\nfuture of observers falling into a black hole. A complete extension had\nalready been found by Martin Kruskal, who was urged to publish it.^[38]\n\nThese results came at the beginning of the golden age of general relativity,\nwhich was marked by general relativity and black holes becoming mainstream\nsubjects of research. This process was helped by the discovery of pulsars by\nJocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967,^[39]^[40] which, by 1969, were shown to be\nrapidly rotating neutron stars.^[41] Until that time, neutron stars, like\nblack holes, were regarded as just theoretical curiosities; but the discovery\nof pulsars showed their physical relevance and spurred a further interest in\nall types of compact objects that might be formed by gravitational\ncollapse.^[42]\n\nIn this period more general black hole solutions were found. In 1963, Roy Kerr\nfound the exact solution for a rotating black hole. Two years later, Ezra\nNewman found the axisymmetric solution for a black hole that is both rotating\nand electrically charged.^[43] Through the work of Werner Israel,^[44] Brandon\nCarter,^[45]^[46] and David Robinson^[47] the no-hair theorem emerged, stating\nthat a stationary black hole solution is completely described by the three\nparameters of the Kerr\u2013Newman metric: mass, angular momentum, and electric\ncharge.^[48]\n\nAt first, it was suspected that the strange features of the black hole\nsolutions were pathological artifacts from the symmetry conditions imposed,\nand that the singularities would not appear in generic situations. This view\nwas held in particular by Vladimir Belinsky, Isaak Khalatnikov, and Evgeny\nLifshitz, who tried to prove that no singularities appear in generic\nsolutions. However, in the late 1960s Roger Penrose^[49] and Stephen Hawking\nused global techniques to prove that singularities appear generically.^[50]\nFor this work, Penrose received half of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics,\nHawking having died in 2018.^[51] Based on observations in Greenwich and\nToronto in the early 1970s, Cygnus X-1, a galactic X-ray source discovered in\n1964, became the first astronomical object commonly accepted to be a black\nhole.^[52]^[53]\n\nWork by James Bardeen, Jacob Bekenstein, Carter, and Hawking in the early\n1970s led to the formulation of black hole thermodynamics.^[54] These laws\ndescribe the behaviour of a black hole in close analogy to the laws of\nthermodynamics by relating mass to energy, area to entropy, and surface\ngravity to temperature. The analogy was completed when Hawking, in 1974,\nshowed that quantum field theory implies that black holes should radiate like\na black body with a temperature proportional to the surface gravity of the\nblack hole, predicting the effect now known as Hawking radiation.^[55]\n\n### Observation\n\nOn 11 February 2016, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo\ncollaboration announced the first direct detection of gravitational waves,\nrepresenting the first observation of a black hole merger.^[56] On 10 April\n2019, the first direct image of a black hole and its vicinity was published,\nfollowing observations made by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) in 2017 of\nthe supermassive black hole in Messier 87's galactic centre.^[57]^[58]^[59] As\nof 2023^[update], the nearest known body thought to be a black hole, Gaia BH1,\nis around 1,560 light-years (480 parsecs) away.^[60] Though only a couple\ndozen black holes have been found so far in the Milky Way, there are thought\nto be hundreds of millions, most of which are solitary and do not cause\nemission of radiation.^[61] Therefore, they would only be detectable by\ngravitational lensing.\n\n### Etymology\n\nJohn Michell used the term \"dark star\" in a November 1783 letter to Henry\nCavendish,^[62] and in the early 20th century, physicists used the term\n\"gravitationally collapsed object\". Science writer Marcia Bartusiak traces the\nterm \"black hole\" to physicist Robert H. Dicke, who in the early 1960s\nreportedly compared the phenomenon to the Black Hole of Calcutta, notorious as\na prison where people entered but never left alive.^[63]\n\nThe term \"black hole\" was used in print by Life and Science News magazines in\n1963,^[63] and by science journalist Ann Ewing in her article \"'Black Holes'\nin Space\", dated 18 January 1964, which was a report on a meeting of the\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science held in Cleveland,\nOhio.^[64]^[65]\n\nIn December 1967, a student reportedly suggested the phrase \"black hole\" at a\nlecture by John Wheeler;^[64] Wheeler adopted the term for its brevity and\n\"advertising value\", and it quickly caught on,^[66] leading some to credit\nWheeler with coining the phrase.^[67]\n\n## Properties and structure\n\nThe no-hair theorem postulates that, once it achieves a stable condition after\nformation, a black hole has only three independent physical properties: mass,\nelectric charge, and angular momentum; the black hole is otherwise\nfeatureless. If the conjecture is true, any two black holes that share the\nsame values for these properties, or parameters, are indistinguishable from\none another. The degree to which the conjecture is true for real black holes\nunder the laws of modern physics is currently an unsolved problem.^[48]\n\nThese properties are special because they are visible from outside a black\nhole. For example, a charged black hole repels other like charges just like\nany other charged object. Similarly, the total mass inside a sphere containing\na black hole can be found by using the gravitational analog of Gauss's law\n(through the ADM mass), far away from the black hole.^[68] Likewise, the\nangular momentum (or spin) can be measured from far away using frame dragging\nby the gravitomagnetic field, through for example the Lense\u2013Thirring\neffect.^[69]\n\nArtistic depiction of a black hole and its features\n\nWhen an object falls into a black hole, any information about the shape of the\nobject or distribution of charge on it is evenly distributed along the horizon\nof the black hole, and is lost to outside observers. The behavior of the\nhorizon in this situation is a dissipative system that is closely analogous to\nthat of a conductive stretchy membrane with friction and electrical\nresistance\u2014the membrane paradigm.^[70] This is different from other field\ntheories such as electromagnetism, which do not have any friction or\nresistivity at the microscopic level, because they are time-reversible.\nBecause a black hole eventually achieves a stable state with only three\nparameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial\nconditions: the gravitational and electric fields of a black hole give very\nlittle information about what went in. The information that is lost includes\nevery quantity that cannot be measured far away from the black hole horizon,\nincluding approximately conserved quantum numbers such as the total baryon\nnumber and lepton number. This behavior is so puzzling that it has been called\nthe black hole information loss paradox.^[71]^[72]\n\n### Physical properties\n\nAn animation of how light rays can be gravitationally bent\n\nThe simplest static black holes have mass but neither electric charge nor\nangular momentum. These black holes are often referred to as Schwarzschild\nblack holes after Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in\n1916.^[18] According to Birkhoff's theorem, it is the only vacuum solution\nthat is spherically symmetric.^[73] This means there is no observable\ndifference at a distance between the gravitational field of such a black hole\nand that of any other spherical object of the same mass. The popular notion of\na black hole \"sucking in everything\" in its surroundings is therefore correct\nonly near a black hole's horizon; far away, the external gravitational field\nis identical to that of any other body of the same mass.^[74]\n\nSolutions describing more general black holes also exist. Non-rotating charged\nblack holes are described by the Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m metric, while the Kerr\nmetric describes a non-charged rotating black hole. The most general\nstationary black hole solution known is the Kerr\u2013Newman metric, which\ndescribes a black hole with both charge and angular momentum.^[75]\n\nWhile the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, the charge and\nangular momentum are constrained by the mass. The total electric charge Q and\nthe total angular momentum J are expected to satisfy the inequality\n\nfor a black hole of mass M. Black holes with the minimum possible mass\nsatisfying this inequality are called extremal. Solutions of Einstein's\nequations that violate this inequality exist, but they do not possess an event\nhorizon. These solutions have so-called naked singularities that can be\nobserved from the outside, and hence are deemed unphysical. The cosmic\ncensorship hypothesis rules out the formation of such singularities, when they\nare created through the gravitational collapse of realistic matter.^[3] This\nis supported by numerical simulations.^[76]\n\nDue to the relatively large strength of the electromagnetic force, black holes\nforming from the collapse of stars are expected to retain the nearly neutral\ncharge of the star. Rotation, however, is expected to be a universal feature\nof compact astrophysical objects. The black-hole candidate binary X-ray source\nGRS 1915+105^[77] appears to have an angular momentum near the maximum allowed\nvalue. That uncharged limit is^[78]\n\nallowing definition of a dimensionless spin parameter such that^[78]\n\n    ^[78]^[Note 1]\nBlack hole classificationsClass| Approx. mass| Approx. radius  \n---|---|---  \nUltramassive black hole| 10^9\u201310^11 M_\u2609| >1,000 AU  \nSupermassive black hole| 10^6\u201310^9 M_\u2609| 0.001\u2013400 AU  \nIntermediate-mass black hole| 10^2\u201310^5 M_\u2609| 10^3 km \u2248 R_Earth  \nStellar black hole| 2-150 M_\u2609| 30 km  \nMicro black hole| up to M_Moon| up to 0.1 mm  \n  \nBlack holes are commonly classified according to their mass, independent of\nangular momentum, J.

It is restricted only by the speed of light.\n\nCloser to the black hole, spacetime starts to deform. There are more paths\ngoing towards the black hole than paths moving away.^[Note 3]\n\nInside of the event horizon, all paths bring the particle closer to the centre\nof the black hole. It is no longer possible for the particle to escape.\n\nThe defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event horizon\u2014a\nboundary in spacetime through which matter and light can pass only inward\ntowards the mass of the black hole. Nothing, not even light, can escape from\ninside the event horizon.^[83]^[84] The event horizon is referred to as such\nbecause if an event occurs within the boundary, information from that event\ncannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine whether\nsuch an event occurred.^[85]\n\nAs predicted by general relativity, the presence of a mass deforms spacetime\nin such a way that the paths taken by particles bend towards the mass.^[86] At\nthe event horizon of a black hole, this deformation becomes so strong that\nthere are no paths that lead away from the black hole.^[87]\n\nTo a distant observer, clocks near a black hole would appear to tick more\nslowly than those farther away from the black hole.^[88] Due to this effect,\nknown as gravitational time dilation, an object falling into a black hole\nappears to slow as it approaches the event horizon, taking an infinite time to\nreach it.^[89] At the same time, all processes on this object slow down, from\nthe viewpoint of a fixed outside observer, causing any light emitted by the\nobject to appear redder and dimmer, an effect known as gravitational\nredshift.^[90] Eventually, the falling object fades away until it can no\nlonger be seen. Typically this process happens very rapidly with an object\ndisappearing from view within less than a second.^[91]\n\nOn the other hand, indestructible observers falling into a black hole do not\nnotice any of these effects as they cross the event horizon. According to\ntheir own clocks, which appear to them to tick normally, they cross the event\nhorizon after a finite time without noting any singular behaviour; in\nclassical general relativity, it is impossible to determine the location of\nthe event horizon from local observations, due to Einstein's equivalence\nprinciple.^[92]^[93]\n\nThe topology of the event horizon of a black hole at equilibrium is always\nspherical.^[Note 4]^[96] For non-rotating (static) black holes the geometry of\nthe event horizon is precisely spherical, while for rotating black holes the\nevent horizon is oblate.^[97]^[98]^[99]\n\n### Singularity\n\nMain article: Gravitational singularity\n\nAt the centre of a black hole, as described by general relativity, may lie a\ngravitational singularity, a region where the spacetime curvature becomes\ninfinite.^[100] For a non-rotating black hole, this region takes the shape of\na single point; for a rotating black hole it is smeared out to form a ring\nsingularity that lies in the plane of rotation.^[101] In both cases, the\nsingular region has zero volume. It can also be shown that the singular region\ncontains all the mass of the black hole solution.^[102] The singular region\ncan thus be thought of as having infinite density.^[103]\n\nObservers falling into a Schwarzschild black hole (i.e., non-rotating and not\ncharged) cannot avoid being carried into the singularity once they cross the\nevent horizon. They can prolong the experience by accelerating away to slow\ntheir descent, but only up to a limit.^[104] When they reach the singularity,\nthey are crushed to infinite density and their mass is added to the total of\nthe black hole. Before that happens, they will have been torn apart by the\ngrowing tidal forces in a process sometimes referred to as spaghettification\nor the \"noodle effect\".^[105]\n\nIn the case of a charged (Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m) or rotating (Kerr) black hole,\nit is possible to avoid the singularity. Extending these solutions as far as\npossible reveals the hypothetical possibility of exiting the black hole into a\ndifferent spacetime with the black hole acting as a wormhole.^[106] The\npossibility of traveling to another universe is, however, only theoretical\nsince any perturbation would destroy this possibility.^[107] It also appears\nto be possible to follow closed timelike curves (returning to one's own past)\naround the Kerr singularity, which leads to problems with causality like the\ngrandfather paradox.^[108] It is expected that none of these peculiar effects\nwould survive in a proper quantum treatment of rotating and charged black\nholes.^[109]\n\nThe appearance of singularities in general relativity is commonly perceived as\nsignaling the breakdown of the theory.^[110] This breakdown, however, is\nexpected; it occurs in a situation where quantum effects should describe these\nactions, due to the extremely high density and therefore particle\ninteractions. To date, it has not been possible to combine quantum and\ngravitational effects into a single theory, although there exist attempts to\nformulate such a theory of quantum gravity. It is generally expected that such\na theory will not feature any singularities.^[111]^[112]\n\n### Photon sphere\n\nMain article: Photon sphere\n\nThe photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness in which photons\nthat move on tangents to that sphere would be trapped in a circular orbit\nabout the black hole. For non-rotating black holes, the photon sphere has a\nradius 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius. Their orbits would be dynamically\nunstable, hence any small perturbation, such as a particle of infalling\nmatter, would cause an instability that would grow over time, either setting\nthe photon on an outward trajectory causing it to escape the black hole, or on\nan inward spiral where it would eventually cross the event horizon.^[113]\n\nWhile light can still escape from the photon sphere, any light that crosses\nthe photon sphere on an inbound trajectory will be captured by the black hole.\nHence any light that reaches an outside observer from the photon sphere must\nhave been emitted by objects between the photon sphere and the event\nhorizon.^[113] For a Kerr black hole the radius of the photon sphere depends\non the spin parameter and on the details of the photon orbit, which can be\nprograde (the photon rotates in the same sense of the black hole spin) or\nretrograde.^[114]^[115]\n\n### Ergosphere\n\nMain article: Ergosphere\n\nThe ergosphere is a region outside of the event horizon, where objects cannot\nremain in place.^[116]\n\nRotating black holes are surrounded by a region of spacetime in which it is\nimpossible to stand still, called the ergosphere. This is the result of a\nprocess known as frame-dragging; general relativity predicts that any rotating\nmass will tend to slightly \"drag\" along the spacetime immediately surrounding\nit. Any object near the rotating mass will tend to start moving in the\ndirection of rotation. For a rotating black hole, this effect is so strong\nnear the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed\nof light in the opposite direction to just stand still.^[117]\n\nThe ergosphere of a black hole is a volume bounded by the black hole's event\nhorizon and the ergosurface, which coincides with the event horizon at the\npoles but is at a much greater distance around the equator.^[116]\n\nObjects and radiation can escape normally from the ergosphere. Through the\nPenrose process, objects can emerge from the ergosphere with more energy than\nthey entered with. The extra energy is taken from the rotational energy of the\nblack hole. Thereby the rotation of the black hole slows down.^[118] A\nvariation of the Penrose process in the presence of strong magnetic fields,\nthe Blandford\u2013Znajek process is considered a likely mechanism for the enormous\nluminosity and relativistic jets of quasars and other active galactic nuclei.\n\n### Innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)\n\nMain article: Innermost stable circular orbit\n\nIn Newtonian gravity, test particles can stably orbit at arbitrary distances\nfrom a central object. In general relativity, however, there exists an\ninnermost stable circular orbit (often called the ISCO), for which any\ninfinitesimal inward perturbations to a circular orbit will lead to spiraling\ninto the black hole, and any outward perturbations will, depending on the\nenergy, result in spiraling in, stably orbiting between apastron and\nperiastron, or escaping to infinity.^[119] The location of the ISCO depends on\nthe spin of the black hole, in the case of a Schwarzschild black hole (spin\nzero) is:\n\nand decreases with increasing black hole spin for particles orbiting in the\nsame direction as the spin.^[120]\n\n## Formation and evolution\n\nGiven the bizarre character of black holes, it was long questioned whether\nsuch objects could actually exist in nature or whether they were merely\npathological solutions to Einstein's equations. Einstein himself wrongly\nthought black holes would not form, because he held that the angular momentum\nof collapsing particles would stabilize their motion at some radius.^[121]\nThis led the general relativity community to dismiss all results to the\ncontrary for many years. However, a minority of relativists continued to\ncontend that black holes were physical objects,^[122] and by the end of the\n1960s, they had persuaded the majority of researchers in the field that there\nis no obstacle to the formation of an event horizon.^[123]\n\nPenrose demonstrated that once an event horizon forms, general relativity\nwithout quantum mechanics requires that a singularity will form within.^[49]\nShortly afterwards, Hawking showed that many cosmological solutions that\ndescribe the Big Bang have singularities without scalar fields or other exotic\nmatter.^[clarification needed] The Kerr solution, the no-hair theorem, and the\nlaws of black hole thermodynamics showed that the physical properties of black\nholes were simple and comprehensible, making them respectable subjects for\nresearch.^[124] Conventional black holes are formed by gravitational collapse\nof heavy objects such as stars, but they can also in theory be formed by other\nprocesses.^[125]^[126]\n\n### Gravitational collapse\n\nMain article: Gravitational collapse\n\nGas cloud being ripped apart by black hole at the centre of the Milky Way\n(observations from 2006, 2010 and 2013 are shown in blue, green and red,\nrespectively).^[127]\n\nGravitational collapse occurs when an object's internal pressure is\ninsufficient to resist the object's own gravity. For stars this usually occurs\neither because a star has too little \"fuel\" left to maintain its temperature\nthrough stellar nucleosynthesis, or because a star that would have been stable\nreceives extra matter in a way that does not raise its core temperature. In\neither case the star's temperature is no longer high enough to prevent it from\ncollapsing under its own weight.^[128] The collapse may be stopped by the\ndegeneracy pressure of the star's constituents, allowing the condensation of\nmatter into an exotic denser state. The result is one of the various types of\ncompact star. Which type forms depends on the mass of the remnant of the\noriginal star left if the outer layers have been blown away (for example, in a\nType II supernova). The mass of the remnant, the collapsed object that\nsurvives the explosion, can be substantially less than that of the original\nstar. Remnants exceeding 5 M_\u2609 are produced by stars that were over 20 M_\u2609\nbefore the collapse.^[128]\n\nIf the mass of the remnant exceeds about 3\u20134 M_\u2609 (the\nTolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit^[27]), either because the original star was\nvery heavy or because the remnant collected additional mass through accretion\nof matter, even the degeneracy pressure of neutrons is insufficient to stop\nthe collapse. No known mechanism (except possibly quark degeneracy pressure)\nis powerful enough to stop the implosion and the object will inevitably\ncollapse to form a black hole.^[128]\n\nThe gravitational collapse of heavy stars is assumed to be responsible for the\nformation of stellar mass black holes. Star formation in the early universe\nmay have resulted in very massive stars, which upon their collapse would have\nproduced black holes of up to 10^3 M_\u2609. These black holes could be the seeds\nof the supermassive black holes found in the centres of most galaxies.^[129]\nIt has further been suggested that massive black holes with typical masses of\n~10^5 M_\u2609 could have formed from the direct collapse of gas clouds in the\nyoung universe.^[125] These massive objects have been proposed as the seeds\nthat eventually formed the earliest quasars observed already at redshift\n.^[130] Some candidates for such objects have been found in observations of\nthe young universe.^[125]\n\nWhile most of the energy released during gravitational collapse is emitted\nvery quickly, an outside observer does not actually see the end of this\nprocess. Even though the collapse takes a finite amount of time from the\nreference frame of infalling matter, a distant observer would see the\ninfalling material slow and halt just above the event horizon, due to\ngravitational time dilation. Light from the collapsing material takes longer\nand longer to reach the observer, with the light emitted just before the event\nhorizon forms delayed an infinite amount of time. Thus the external observer\nnever sees the formation of the event horizon; instead, the collapsing\nmaterial seems to become dimmer and increasingly red-shifted, eventually\nfading away.^[131]\n\n#### Primordial black holes and the Big Bang\n\nGravitational collapse requires great density. In the current epoch of the\nuniverse these high densities are found only in stars, but in the early\nuniverse shortly after the Big Bang densities were much greater, possibly\nallowing for the creation of black holes. High density alone is not enough to\nallow black hole formation since a uniform mass distribution will not allow\nthe mass to bunch up. In order for primordial black holes to have formed in\nsuch a dense medium, there must have been initial density perturbations that\ncould then grow under their own gravity. Different models for the early\nuniverse vary widely in their predictions of the scale of these fluctuations.\nVarious models predict the creation of primordial black holes ranging in size\nfrom a Planck mass ( \u2248 1.2\u00d710^19 GeV/c^2 \u2248 2.2\u00d710^\u22128 kg) to hundreds of\nthousands of solar masses.^[126]\n\nDespite the early universe being extremely dense, it did not re-collapse into\na black hole during the Big Bang, since the expansion rate was greater than\nthe attraction. Following inflation theory there was a net repulsive\ngravitation in the beginning until the end of inflation. Since then the Hubble\nflow was slowed by the energy density of the universe.\n\nModels for the gravitational collapse of objects of relatively constant size,\nsuch as stars, do not necessarily apply in the same way to rapidly expanding\nspace such as the Big Bang.^[132]\n\n### High-energy collisions\n\nGravitational collapse is not the only process that could create black holes.\nIn principle, black holes could be formed in high-energy collisions that\nachieve sufficient density. As of 2002, no such events have been detected,\neither directly or indirectly as a deficiency of the mass balance in particle\naccelerator experiments.^[133] This suggests that there must be a lower limit\nfor the mass of black holes. Theoretically, this boundary is expected to lie\naround the Planck mass, where quantum effects are expected to invalidate the\npredictions of general relativity.^[134] This would put the creation of black\nholes firmly out of reach of any high-energy process occurring on or near the\nEarth. However, certain developments in quantum gravity suggest that the\nminimum black hole mass could be much lower: some braneworld scenarios for\nexample put the boundary as low as 1 TeV/c^2.^[135] This would make it\nconceivable for micro black holes to be created in the high-energy collisions\nthat occur when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere, or possibly in the\nLarge Hadron Collider at CERN. These theories are very speculative, and the\ncreation of black holes in these processes is deemed unlikely by many\nspecialists.^[136] Even if micro black holes could be formed, it is expected\nthat they would evaporate in about 10^\u221225 seconds, posing no threat to the\nEarth.^[137]\n\n### Growth\n\nOnce a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing additional\nmatter. Any black hole will continually absorb gas and interstellar dust from\nits surroundings. This growth process is one possible way through which some\nsupermassive black holes may have been formed, although the formation of\nsupermassive black holes is still an open field of research.^[129] A similar\nprocess has been suggested for the formation of intermediate-mass black holes\nfound in globular clusters.^[138] Black holes can also merge with other\nobjects such as stars or even other black holes. This is thought to have been\nimportant, especially in the early growth of supermassive black holes, which\ncould have formed from the aggregation of many smaller objects.^[129] The\nprocess has also been proposed as the origin of some intermediate-mass black\nholes.^[139]^[140]\n\n### Evaporation\n\nMain article: Hawking radiation\n\nIn 1974, Hawking predicted that black holes are not entirely black but emit\nsmall amounts of thermal radiation at a temperature \u0127c^3/(8\u03c0GMk_B);^[55] this\neffect has become known as Hawking radiation. By applying quantum field theory\nto a static black hole background, he determined that a black hole should emit\nparticles that display a perfect black body spectrum. Since Hawking's\npublication, many others have verified the result through various\napproaches.^[141] If Hawking's theory of black hole radiation is correct, then\nblack holes are expected to shrink and evaporate over time as they lose mass\nby the emission of photons and other particles.^[55] The temperature of this\nthermal spectrum (Hawking temperature) is proportional to the surface gravity\nof the black hole, which, for a Schwarzschild black hole, is inversely\nproportional to the mass. Hence, large black holes emit less radiation than\nsmall black holes.^[142]\n\nA stellar black hole of 1 M_\u2609 has a Hawking temperature of 62\nnanokelvins.^[143] This is far less than the 2.7 K temperature of the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation. Stellar-mass or larger black holes receive\nmore mass from the cosmic microwave background than they emit through Hawking\nradiation and thus will grow instead of shrinking.^[144] To have a Hawking\ntemperature larger than 2.7 K (and be able to evaporate), a black hole would\nneed a mass less than the Moon. Such a black hole would have a diameter of\nless than a tenth of a millimeter.^[145]\n\nIf a black hole is very small, the radiation effects are expected to become\nvery strong. A black hole with the mass of a car would have a diameter of\nabout 10^\u221224 m and take a nanosecond to evaporate, during which time it would\nbriefly have a luminosity of more than 200 times that of the Sun. Lower-mass\nblack holes are expected to evaporate even faster; for example, a black hole\nof mass 1 TeV/c^2 would take less than 10^\u221288 seconds to evaporate completely.\nFor such a small black hole, quantum gravity effects are expected to play an\nimportant role and could hypothetically make such a small black hole stable,\nalthough current developments in quantum gravity do not indicate this is the\ncase.^[146]^[147]\n\nThe Hawking radiation for an astrophysical black hole is predicted to be very\nweak and would thus be exceedingly difficult to detect from Earth. A possible\nexception, however, is the burst of gamma rays emitted in the last stage of\nthe evaporation of primordial black holes. Searches for such flashes have\nproven unsuccessful and provide stringent limits on the possibility of\nexistence of low mass primordial black holes.^[148] NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray\nSpace Telescope launched in 2008 will continue the search for these\nflashes.^[149]\n\nIf black holes evaporate via Hawking radiation, a solar mass black hole will\nevaporate (beginning once the temperature of the cosmic microwave background\ndrops below that of the black hole) over a period of 10^64 years.^[150] A\nsupermassive black hole with a mass of 10^11 M_\u2609 will evaporate in around\n2\u00d710^100 years.^[151] Some monster black holes in the universe are predicted\nto continue to grow up to perhaps 10^14 M_\u2609 during the collapse of\nsuperclusters of galaxies. Even these would evaporate over a timescale of up\nto 10^106 years.^[150]\n\nSome models of quantum gravity predict modifications of the Hawking\ndescription of black holes. In particular, the evolution equations describing\nthe mass loss rate and charge loss rate get modified.^[152]\n\n## Observational evidence\n\nBy nature, black holes do not themselves emit any electromagnetic radiation\nother than the hypothetical Hawking radiation, so astrophysicists searching\nfor black holes must generally rely on indirect observations. For example, a\nblack hole's existence can sometimes be inferred by observing its\ngravitational influence on its surroundings.^[153]\n\n### Direct interferometry\n\nA view of M87* black hole in polarised lightSagittarius A*, black hole in the\ncenter of the Milky Way\n\nThe Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is an active program that directly observes\nthe immediate environment of black holes' event horizons, such as the black\nhole at the centre of the Milky Way. In April 2017, EHT began observing the\nblack hole at the centre of Messier 87.^[154]^[155] \"In all, eight radio\nobservatories on six mountains and four continents observed the galaxy in\nVirgo on and off for 10 days in April 2017\" to provide the data yielding the\nimage in April 2019.^[156] After two years of data processing, EHT released\nthe first direct image of a black hole; specifically, the supermassive black\nhole that lies in the centre of the aforementioned galaxy.^[157]^[158] What is\nvisible is not the black hole\u2014which shows as black because of the loss of all\nlight within this dark region. Instead, it is the gases at the edge of the\nevent horizon (displayed as orange or red) that define the black hole.^[159]\n\nOn 12 May 2022, the EHT released the first image of Sagittarius A*, the\nsupermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way galaxy. The published\nimage displayed the same ring-like structure and circular shadow as seen in\nthe M87* black hole, and the image was created using the same techniques as\nfor the M87 black hole. However, the imaging process for Sagittarius A*, which\nis more than a thousand times smaller and less massive than M87*, was\nsignificantly more complex because of the instability of its\nsurroundings.^[160] The image of Sagittarius A* was also partially blurred by\nturbulent plasma on the way to the galactic centre, an effect which prevents\nresolution of the image at longer wavelengths.^[161]\n\nThe brightening of this material in the 'bottom' half of the processed EHT\nimage is thought to be caused by Doppler beaming, whereby material approaching\nthe viewer at relativistic speeds is perceived as brighter than material\nmoving away. In the case of a black hole, this phenomenon implies that the\nvisible material is rotating at relativistic speeds (>1,000 km/s [2,200,000\nmph]), the only speeds at which it is possible to centrifugally balance the\nimmense gravitational attraction of the singularity, and thereby remain in\norbit above the event horizon. This configuration of bright material implies\nthat the EHT observed M87* from a perspective catching the black hole's\naccretion disc nearly edge-on, as the whole system rotated\nclockwise.^[162]^[163] However, the extreme gravitational lensing associated\nwith black holes produces the illusion of a perspective that sees the\naccretion disc from above. In reality, most of the ring in the EHT image was\ncreated when the light emitted by the far side of the accretion disc bent\naround the black hole's gravity well and escaped, meaning that most of the\npossible perspectives on M87* can see the entire disc, even that directly\nbehind the \"shadow\".\n\nIn 2015, the EHT detected magnetic fields just outside the event horizon of\nSagittarius A* and even discerned some of their properties. The field lines\nthat pass through the accretion disc were a complex mixture of ordered and\ntangled. Theoretical studies of black holes had predicted the existence of\nmagnetic fields.^[164]^[165]\n\nIn April 2023, an image of the shadow of the Messier 87 black hole and the\nrelated high-energy jet, viewed together for the first time, was\npresented.^[166]^[167]\n\n### Detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes\n\nLIGO measurement of the gravitational waves at the Livingston (right) and\nHanford (left) detectors, compared with the theoretical predicted values\n\nOn 14 September 2015, the LIGO gravitational wave observatory made the first-\never successful direct observation of gravitational waves.^[56]^[168] The\nsignal was consistent with theoretical predictions for the gravitational waves\nproduced by the merger of two black holes: one with about 36 solar masses, and\nthe other around 29 solar masses.^[56]^[169] This observation provides the\nmost concrete evidence for the existence of black holes to date. For instance,\nthe gravitational wave signal suggests that the separation of the two objects\nbefore the merger was just 350 km (or roughly four times the Schwarzschild\nradius corresponding to the inferred masses). The objects must therefore have\nbeen extremely compact, leaving black holes as the most plausible\ninterpretation.^[56]\n\nMore importantly, the signal observed by LIGO also included the start of the\npost-merger ringdown, the signal produced as the newly formed compact object\nsettles down to a stationary state. Arguably, the ringdown is the most direct\nway of observing a black hole.^[170] From the LIGO signal, it is possible to\nextract the frequency and damping time of the dominant mode of the ringdown.\nFrom these, it is possible to infer the mass and angular momentum of the final\nobject, which match independent predictions from numerical simulations of the\nmerger.^[171] The frequency and decay time of the dominant mode are determined\nby the geometry of the photon sphere. Hence, observation of this mode confirms\nthe presence of a photon sphere; however, it cannot exclude possible exotic\nalternatives to black holes that are compact enough to have a photon\nsphere.^[170]^[172]\n\nThe observation also provides the first observational evidence for the\nexistence of stellar-mass black hole binaries. Furthermore, it is the first\nobservational evidence of stellar-mass black holes weighing 25 solar masses or\nmore.^[173]\n\nSince then, many more gravitational wave events have been observed.^[174]\n\n### Stars orbiting Sagittarius A*\n\nMain article: Sagittarius A* cluster\n\nStars moving around Sagittarius A* as seen in 2021\n\nThe proper motions of stars near the centre of our own Milky Way provide\nstrong observational evidence that these stars are orbiting a supermassive\nblack hole.^[175] Since 1995, astronomers have tracked the motions of 90 stars\norbiting an invisible object coincident with the radio source Sagittarius A*.\nBy fitting their motions to Keplerian orbits, the astronomers were able to\ninfer, in 1998, that a 2.6\u00d710^6 M_\u2609 object must be contained in a volume with\na radius of 0.02 light-years to cause the motions of those stars.^[176] Since\nthen, one of the stars\u2014called S2\u2014has completed a full orbit. From the orbital\ndata, astronomers were able to refine the calculations of the mass to 4.3\u00d710^6\nM_\u2609 and a radius of less than 0.002 light-years for the object causing the\norbital motion of those stars.^[175] The upper limit on the object's size is\nstill too large to test whether it is smaller than its Schwarzschild radius;\nnevertheless, these observations strongly suggest that the central object is a\nsupermassive black hole as there are no other plausible scenarios for\nconfining so much invisible mass into such a small volume.^[176] Additionally,\nthere is some observational evidence that this object might possess an event\nhorizon, a feature unique to black holes.^[177]\n\n### Accretion of matter\n\nSee also: Accretion disk\n\nBlurring of X-rays near black hole (NuSTAR; 12 August 2014)^[178]\n\nDue to conservation of angular momentum,^[179] gas falling into the\ngravitational well created by a massive object will typically form a disk-like\nstructure around the object. Artists' impressions such as the accompanying\nrepresentation of a black hole with corona commonly depict the black hole as\nif it were a flat-space body hiding the part of the disk just behind it, but\nin reality gravitational lensing would greatly distort the image of the\naccretion disk.^[180]\n\nWithin such a disk, friction would cause angular momentum to be transported\noutward, allowing matter to fall farther inward, thus releasing potential\nenergy and increasing the temperature of the gas.^[181]\n\nWhen the accreting object is a neutron star or a black hole, the gas in the\ninner accretion disk orbits at very high speeds because of its proximity to\nthe compact object. The resulting friction is so significant that it heats the\ninner disk to temperatures at which it emits vast amounts of electromagnetic\nradiation (mainly X-rays). These bright X-ray sources may be detected by\ntelescopes. This process of accretion is one of the most efficient energy-\nproducing processes known; up to 40% of the rest mass of the accreted material\ncan be emitted as radiation.^[181] (In nuclear fusion only about 0.7% of the\nrest mass will be emitted as energy.) In many cases, accretion disks are\naccompanied by relativistic jets that are emitted along the poles, which carry\naway much of the energy. The mechanism for the creation of these jets is\ncurrently not well understood, in part due to insufficient data.^[182]\n\nAs such, many of the universe's more energetic phenomena have been attributed\nto the accretion of matter on black holes. In particular, active galactic\nnuclei and quasars are believed to be the accretion disks of supermassive\nblack holes.^[183] Similarly, X-ray binaries are generally accepted to be\nbinary star systems in which one of the two stars is a compact object\naccreting matter from its companion.^[183] It has also been suggested that\nsome ultraluminous X-ray sources may be the accretion disks of intermediate-\nmass black holes.^[184]\n\nIn November 2011 the first direct observation of a quasar accretion disk\naround a supermassive black hole was reported.^[185]^[186]\n\n#### X-ray binaries\n\nSee also: X-ray binary\n\nA Chandra X-Ray Observatory image of Cygnus X-1, which was the first strong\nblack hole candidate discovered\n\nX-ray binaries are binary star systems that emit a majority of their radiation\nin the X-ray part of the spectrum. These X-ray emissions are generally thought\nto result when one of the stars (compact object) accretes matter from another\n(regular) star. The presence of an ordinary star in such a system provides an\nopportunity for studying the central object and to determine if it might be a\nblack hole.^[183]\n\nIf such a system emits signals that can be directly traced back to the compact\nobject, it cannot be a black hole. The absence of such a signal does, however,\nnot exclude the possibility that the compact object is a neutron star. By\nstudying the companion star it is often possible to obtain the orbital\nparameters of the system and to obtain an estimate for the mass of the compact\nobject. If this is much larger than the Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit (the\nmaximum mass a star can have without collapsing) then the object cannot be a\nneutron star and is generally expected to be a black hole.^[183]\n\nThe first strong candidate for a black hole, Cygnus X-1, was discovered in\nthis way by Charles Thomas Bolton,^[187] Louise Webster, and Paul Murdin^[188]\nin 1972.^[189]^[190] Some doubt, however, remained due to the uncertainties\nthat result from the companion star being much heavier than the candidate\nblack hole. Currently, better candidates for black holes are found in a class\nof X-ray binaries called soft X-ray transients. In this class of system, the\ncompanion star is of relatively low mass allowing for more accurate estimates\nof the black hole mass. Moreover, these systems actively emit X-rays for only\nseveral months once every 10\u201350 years. During the period of low X-ray emission\n(called quiescence), the accretion disk is extremely faint allowing detailed\nobservation of the companion star during this period. One of the best such\ncandidates is V404 Cygni.^[183]\n\n##### Quasi-periodic oscillations\n\nMain article: Quasi-periodic oscillation\n\nThe X-ray emissions from accretion disks sometimes flicker at certain\nfrequencies. These signals are called quasi-periodic oscillations and are\nthought to be caused by material moving along the inner edge of the accretion\ndisk (the innermost stable circular orbit). As such their frequency is linked\nto the mass of the compact object. They can thus be used as an alternative way\nto determine the mass of candidate black holes.^[191]\n\n#### Galactic nuclei\n\nSee also: Active galactic nucleus\n\nDetection of unusually bright X-ray flare from Sagittarius A*, a black hole in\nthe centre of the Milky Way galaxy on 5 January 2015^[192]\n\nAstronomers use the term \"active galaxy\" to describe galaxies with unusual\ncharacteristics, such as unusual spectral line emission and very strong radio\nemission. Theoretical and observational studies have shown that the activity\nin these active galactic nuclei (AGN) may be explained by the presence of\nsupermassive black holes, which can be millions of times more massive than\nstellar ones. The models of these AGN consist of a central black hole that may\nbe millions or billions of times more massive than the Sun; a disk of\ninterstellar gas and dust called an accretion disk; and two jets perpendicular\nto the accretion disk.^[193]^[194]\n\nAlthough supermassive black holes are expected to be found in most AGN, only\nsome galaxies' nuclei have been more carefully studied in attempts to both\nidentify and measure the actual masses of the central supermassive black hole\ncandidates. Some of the most notable galaxies with supermassive black hole\ncandidates include the Andromeda Galaxy, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC\n4258, NGC 4889, NGC 1277, OJ 287, APM 08279+5255 and the Sombrero\nGalaxy.^[195]\n\nIt is now widely accepted that the centre of nearly every galaxy, not just\nactive ones, contains a supermassive black hole.^[196] The close observational\ncorrelation between the mass of this hole and the velocity dispersion of the\nhost galaxy's bulge, known as the M\u2013sigma relation, strongly suggests a\nconnection between the formation of the black hole and that of the galaxy\nitself.^[197]\n\n### Microlensing\n\nAnother way the black hole nature of an object may be tested is through\nobservation of effects caused by a strong gravitational field in their\nvicinity. One such effect is gravitational lensing: The deformation of\nspacetime around a massive object causes light rays to be deflected, such as\nlight passing through an optic lens. Observations have been made of weak\ngravitational lensing, in which light rays are deflected by only a few\narcseconds. Microlensing occurs when the sources are unresolved and the\nobserver sees a small brightening. In January 2022, astronomers reported the\nfirst possible detection of a microlensing event from an isolated black\nhole.^[198]\n\nAnother possibility for observing gravitational lensing by a black hole would\nbe to observe stars orbiting the black hole. There are several candidates for\nsuch an observation in orbit around Sagittarius A*.^[199]\n\n## Alternatives\n\nSee also: Exotic star\n\nThe evidence for stellar black holes strongly relies on the existence of an\nupper limit for the mass of a neutron star. The size of this limit heavily\ndepends on the assumptions made about the properties of dense matter. New\nexotic phases of matter could push up this bound.^[183] A phase of free quarks\nat high density might allow the existence of dense quark stars,^[200] and some\nsupersymmetric models predict the existence of Q stars.^[201] Some extensions\nof the standard model posit the existence of preons as fundamental building\nblocks of quarks and leptons, which could hypothetically form preon\nstars.^[202] These hypothetical models could potentially explain a number of\nobservations of stellar black hole candidates. However, it can be shown from\narguments in general relativity that any such object will have a maximum\nmass.^[183]\n\nSince the average density of a black hole inside its Schwarzschild radius is\ninversely proportional to the square of its mass, supermassive black holes are\nmuch less dense than stellar black holes (the average density of a 10^8 M_\u2609\nblack hole is comparable to that of water).^[183] Consequently, the physics of\nmatter forming a supermassive black hole is much better understood and the\npossible alternative explanations for supermassive black hole observations are\nmuch more mundane. For example, a supermassive black hole could be modelled by\na large cluster of very dark objects. However, such alternatives are typically\nnot stable enough to explain the supermassive black hole candidates.^[183]\n\nThe evidence for the existence of stellar and supermassive black holes implies\nthat in order for black holes to not form, general relativity must fail as a\ntheory of gravity, perhaps due to the onset of quantum mechanical corrections.\nA much anticipated feature of a theory of quantum gravity is that it will not\nfeature singularities or event horizons and thus black holes would not be real\nartifacts.^[203] For example, in the fuzzball model^[204] based on string\ntheory, the individual states of a black hole solution do not generally have\nan event horizon or singularity, but for a classical/semiclassical observer\nthe statistical average of such states appears just as an ordinary black hole\nas deduced from general relativity.^[205]\n\nA few theoretical objects have been conjectured to match observations of\nastronomical black hole candidates identically or near-identically,^[172] but\nwhich function via a different mechanism. These include the gravastar,^[206]\nthe black star,^[207] related nestar^[208] and the dark-energy star.^[209]\n\n## Open questions\n\n### Entropy and thermodynamics\n\nFurther information: Black hole thermodynamics and Bekenstein bound\n\nS = 1/4 c^3k/G\u0127 A\n\nThe formula for the Bekenstein\u2013Hawking entropy (S) of a black hole, which\ndepends on the area of the black hole (A). The constants are the speed of\nlight (c), the Boltzmann constant (k), Newton's constant (G), and the reduced\nPlanck constant (\u0127). In Planck units, this reduces to S = A/4.\n\nIn 1971, Hawking showed under general conditions^[Note 5] that the total area\nof the event horizons of any collection of classical black holes can never\ndecrease, even if they collide and merge.^[210] This result, now known as the\nsecond law of black hole mechanics, is remarkably similar to the second law of\nthermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can\nnever decrease. As with classical objects at absolute zero temperature, it was\nassumed that black holes had zero entropy. If this were the case, the second\nlaw of thermodynamics would be violated by entropy-laden matter entering a\nblack hole, resulting in a decrease in the total entropy of the universe.\nTherefore, Bekenstein proposed that a black hole should have an entropy, and\nthat it should be proportional to its horizon area.^[211]\n\nThe link with the laws of thermodynamics was further strengthened by Hawking's\ndiscovery in 1974 that quantum field theory predicts that a black hole\nradiates blackbody radiation at a constant temperature. This seemingly causes\na violation of the second law of black hole mechanics, since the radiation\nwill carry away energy from the black hole causing it to shrink. The\nradiation, however also carries away entropy, and it can be proven under\ngeneral assumptions that the sum of the entropy of the matter surrounding a\nblack hole and one quarter of the area of the horizon as measured in Planck\nunits is in fact always increasing. This allows the formulation of the first\nlaw of black hole mechanics as an analogue of the first law of thermodynamics,\nwith the mass acting as energy, the surface gravity as temperature and the\narea as entropy.^[211]\n\nOne puzzling feature is that the entropy of a black hole scales with its area\nrather than with its volume, since entropy is normally an extensive quantity\nthat scales linearly with the volume of the system. This odd property led\nGerard 't Hooft and Leonard Susskind to propose the holographic principle,\nwhich suggests that anything that happens in a volume of spacetime can be\ndescribed by data on the boundary of that volume.^[212]\n\nAlthough general relativity can be used to perform a semiclassical calculation\nof black hole entropy, this situation is theoretically unsatisfying. In\nstatistical mechanics, entropy is understood as counting the number of\nmicroscopic configurations of a system that have the same macroscopic\nqualities (such as mass, charge, pressure, etc.). Without a satisfactory\ntheory of quantum gravity, one cannot perform such a computation for black\nholes. Some progress has been made in various approaches to quantum gravity.\nIn 1995, Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa showed that counting the\nmicrostates of a specific supersymmetric black hole in string theory\nreproduced the Bekenstein\u2013Hawking entropy.^[213] Since then, similar results\nhave been reported for different black holes both in string theory and in\nother approaches to quantum gravity like loop quantum gravity.^[214]\n\nAnother promising approach is constituted by treating gravity as an effective\nfield theory. One first computes the quantum gravitational corrections to the\nradius of the event horizon of the black hole, then integrates over it to find\nthe quantum gravitational corrections to the entropy as given by the Wald\nformula. The method was applied for Schwarzschild black holes by Calmet and\nKuipers,^[215] then successfully generalised for charged black holes by Campos\nDelgado.^[216]\n\n### Information loss paradox\n\nMain article: Black hole information paradox\n\nUnsolved problem in physics:\n\nIs physical information lost in black holes?\n\n(more unsolved problems in physics)\n\nBecause a black hole has only a few internal parameters, most of the\ninformation about the matter that went into forming the black hole is lost.\nRegardless of the type of matter which goes into a black hole, it appears that\nonly information concerning the total mass, charge, and angular momentum are\nconserved. As long as black holes were thought to persist forever this\ninformation loss is not that problematic, as the information can be thought of\nas existing inside the black hole, inaccessible from the outside, but\nrepresented on the event horizon in accordance with the holographic principle.\nHowever, black holes slowly evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation. This\nradiation does not appear to carry any additional information about the matter\nthat formed the black hole, meaning that this information appears to be gone\nforever.^[217]\n\nThe question whether information is truly lost in black holes (the black hole\ninformation paradox) has divided the theoretical physics community. In quantum\nmechanics, loss of information corresponds to the violation of a property\ncalled unitarity, and it has been argued that loss of unitarity would also\nimply violation of conservation of energy,^[218] though this has also been\ndisputed.^[219] Over recent years evidence has been building that indeed\ninformation and unitarity are preserved in a full quantum gravitational\ntreatment of the problem.^[220]\n\nOne attempt to resolve the black hole information paradox is known as black\nhole complementarity. In 2012, the \"firewall paradox\" was introduced with the\ngoal of demonstrating that black hole complementarity fails to solve the\ninformation paradox. According to quantum field theory in curved spacetime, a\nsingle emission of Hawking radiation involves two mutually entangled\nparticles. The outgoing particle escapes and is emitted as a quantum of\nHawking radiation; the infalling particle is swallowed by the black hole.\nAssume a black hole formed a finite time in the past and will fully evaporate\naway in some finite time in the future. Then, it will emit only a finite\namount of information encoded within its Hawking radiation. According to\nresearch by physicists like Don Page^[221]^[222] and Leonard Susskind, there\nwill eventually be a time by which an outgoing particle must be entangled with\nall the Hawking radiation the black hole has previously emitted. This\nseemingly creates a paradox: a principle called \"monogamy of entanglement\"\nrequires that, like any quantum system, the outgoing particle cannot be fully\nentangled with two other systems at the same time; yet here the outgoing\nparticle appears to be entangled both with the infalling particle and,\nindependently, with past Hawking radiation.^[223] In order to resolve this\ncontradiction, physicists may eventually be forced to give up one of three\ntime-tested principles: Einstein's equivalence principle, unitarity, or local\nquantum field theory. One possible solution, which violates the equivalence\nprinciple, is that a \"firewall\" destroys incoming particles at the event\nhorizon.^[224] In general, which\u2014if any\u2014of these assumptions should be\nabandoned remains a topic of debate.^[219]\n\n## See also\n\n  * Binary black hole\n  * Black brane or Black string\n  * Black Hole Initiative\n  * Black hole starship\n  * Black holes in fiction\n  * Blanet\n  * BTZ black hole\n  * Charged black hole\n  * Direct collapse black hole\n  * Hypothetical black hole (disambiguation)\n  * Kugelblitz (astrophysics)\n  * List of black holes\n  * List of nearest black holes\n  * Outline of black holes\n  * Sonic black hole\n  * Virtual black hole\n  * Susskind-Hawking battle\n  * Timeline of black hole physics\n  * White hole\n  * Planck star\n  * Dark star (dark matter)\n  * Schwarzschild radius\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. ^ The value of cJ/GM^2 can exceed 1 for objects other than black holes.

In higher dimensions more complicated horizon topologies like a black ring are possible.^[94]^[95]\n  5. ^ In particular, he assumed that all matter satisfies the weak energy condition.\n\n## References\n\n  1. ^ Oldham, L.
