In this paper, we show how language models can\n> be taught to search by representing the process of search in language, as a\n> flattened string -- a stream of search (SoS). We propose a unified language\n> for search that captures an array of different symbolic search strategies.\n> We demonstrate our approach using the simple yet difficult game of\n> Countdown, where the goal is to combine input numbers with arithmetic\n> operations to reach a target number. We pretrain a transformer-based\n> language model from scratch on a dataset of streams of search generated by\n> heuristic solvers. We find that SoS pretraining increases search accuracy by\n> 25% over models trained to predict only the optimal search trajectory. We\n> further finetune this model with two policy improvement methods: Advantage-\n> Induced Policy Alignment (APA) and Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR). The\n> finetuned SoS models solve 36% of previously unsolved problems, including\n> problems that cannot be solved by any of the heuristic solvers. Our results\n> indicate that language models can learn to solve problems via search, self-\n> improve to flexibly use different search strategies, and potentially\n> discover new ones.\n\nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nComputation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.03683 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2404.03683v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Kanishk Gandhi [view email] [v1] Mon, 1 Apr 2024 06:50:52 UTC (2,903 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Stream of Search (SoS): Learning to Search in\nLanguage, by Kanishk Gandhi and 6 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
