For a biographer this bodes ill. There are some writers whose work\ncomposts fascinatingly into their biographies, and others whose work sits in\ntheir life story like a body in an anaerobic bog, weird and leathery and\nstubbornly separate. Both the unaccountable precocity of her achievements and\nthe all-round freakiness of her imagination suggest that McCullers is the\nsecond kind of writer.\n\nPerhaps this is one reason why few have attempted a biography. In the two\ndecades since The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter was selected for Oprah\u2019s Book Club\nthere has been a proliferation of work relating to McCullers \u2013 stage plays,\nmemoirs, songs and subtly conversant novels such as Catherine Lacey\u2019s Pew\n(2020) \u2013 but with the exception of one study translated from French, there has\nbeen no Life since Virginia Spencer Carr\u2019s The Lonely Hunter (1975), which was\npublished just eight years after its subject\u2019s death. Carr\u2019s book was richly\noral-historical and full of things you didn\u2019t realize you wanted, such as a\nparagraph-long description of what the Hudson waterfront smelt like during\nMcCullers\u2019s first visit to Manhattan, and details of her opinions on small\ndogs (\u201ctoo poky and inquisitive\u201d), so for Mary V. Dearborn\u2019s publishers to\npush this as \u201cthe first dimensional life\u201d of the author seems a bit hard on\nCarr. But the point stands. McCullers, in her afterlife, has become a thing\nalmost inconceivable: a canonical writer short on biographies.\n\nThe first surprise for those turning to her life from her work is that it\nbegan amid so much love. Marguerite Vera Smith \u2013 known to all as B\u00e9b\u00e9 \u2013 had\nhoped for a boy, albeit largely, and obscurely, because she wanted to give her\nfirst child the name Enrico Caruso. In February 1917 she happily settled for a\ndaughter, and Lula Carson. There were more important things to worry about\nthan names, because she reckoned the infant was a genius and bound to be\nfamous. B\u00e9b\u00e9 could recite the first chapter of War and Peace from heart,\nhosted a salon of local artists at the family home in the Georgia mill town of\nColumbus, and patted lilac cologne into her beloved daughter\u2019s hair....\n\nYou have no more free articles available\n\n## Enjoy unlimited digital access, free for 1 month\n\nSubscribe\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in here\n\n## Keep reading\n\nBiography|Book Review\n\n## Never the twain shall meet\n\nHow Byron and Austen shadowed each other\n\nBy Kathryn Sutherland\n\nBiography|Book Review\n\n## A chameleon life\n\nReviving Byron on the bicentenary of his death\n\nBy Corin Throsby\n\nBiography|Book Review\n\n## Motif man\n\nThe banker who became an art historian\n\nBy Edward Wilson-Lee\n\nBiography|Book Review\n\n## News we could use\n\nThe former spy who revolutionized BBC radio\n\nBy Vanessa Curtis\n\n## The TLS Newsletter\n\nJoin 40,000 readers to enjoy a regular dose of inspiration and motivation,\ndelivered to your inbox every Thursday.\n\nYou information will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy\n\n## Thanks for signing up!\n\n### Your newsletter subscription preferences have been updated.\n\n  * Home\n  * Regular features\n\n    * Audio / Visual\n    * Cartoons\n    * Crossword & quiz\n    * In Brief\n    * Grace Notes\n    * Letters to the Editor\n    * Mary Beard: A Don's life\n    * NB\n    * Poem of the week\n    * The Podcast\n    * Twenty Questions\n  * The Archive\n\n    * The Archive\n  * Explore\n\n    * Welcome to the TLS\n    * Highlights\n  * Categories\n\n    * Arts\n    * Classics\n    * Culture\n    * History\n    * Languages & Linguistics\n    * Literature\n    * Lives\n    * Philosophy\n    * Politics & society\n    * Regular features\n    * Religion\n    * Science & technology\n    * World\n  * About us\n\n    * Contact us\n    * Commissioning Terms\n    * Frequently Asked Questions\n    * How to Advertise\n  * Shop\n\n### Follow us on\n\n### Subscribe to the podcast\n\nGoogle Podcasts\n\nSpotify\n\nApple Podcasts\n\nTerms & ConditionsPrivacyCookie Settings\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Times Literary Supplement Limited 2024.
