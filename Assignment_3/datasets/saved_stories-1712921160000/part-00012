Tucker March 15, 2024 Government, History, Technology 9 minute\nread\n\nSHARE | PRINT | EMAIL\n\nIn the 1990s and for years into our century, it was common to ridicule the\ngovernment for being technologically backwards. We were all gaining access to\nfabulous things, including webs, apps, search tools, and social media. But\ngovernments at all levels were stuck in the past using IBM mainframes and\nlarge floppy disks. We had a great time poking fun at them.\n\nI recall the days of thinking government would never catch up to the glories\nand might of the market itself. I wrote several books on it, full of techno-\noptimism.\n\nThe new tech sector had a libertarian ethos about it. They didn\u2019t care about\nthe government and its bureaucrats. They didn\u2019t have lobbyists in Washington.\nThey were the new technologies of freedom and didn\u2019t care much about the old\nanalogue world of command and control. They would usher in a new age of people\npower.\n\nHere we sit a quarter-century later with documented evidence that the opposite\nhappened. The private sector collects the data that the government buys and\nuses as a tool of control. What is shared and how many people see it is a\nmatter of algorithms agreed upon by a combination of government agencies,\nuniversity centers, various nonprofits, and the companies themselves. The\nwhole thing has become an oppressive blob.\n\nHere is Google\u2019s new headquarters in Reston, Virginia.\n\nAnd here is Amazon\u2019s, in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nEvery major company that once stayed far away from Washington now owns a\nsimilar giant palace in or around D.C., and they collect tens of billions in\ngovernment revenue. Government has now become a major customer, if not the\nmain customer, of the services provided by the large social media and tech\ncompanies. They are advertisers but also massive purchasers of the main\nproduct too.\n\nAmazon, Microsoft, and Google are the biggest winners of government contracts,\naccording to a report from Tussel. Amazon hosts the data of the National\nSecurity Agency with a $10 billion contract, and gets hundreds of millions\nfrom other governments. We do not know how much Google has received from the\nUS government, but it is surely a substantial share of the $694 billion the\nfederal government hands out in contracts.\n\nMicrosoft also has a large share of government contracts. In 2023, the US\nDepartment of Defense awarded the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability contract\nto Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Oracle. The contract is worth up to $9\nbillion and provides the Department of Defense with cloud services. It\u2019s just\nthe beginning. The Pentagon is looking for a successor plan that will be\nbigger.\n\nActually, we don\u2019t even know the full extent of this but it is gargantuan.\nYes, these companies provide the regular consumer services but a main and even\ndecisive customer is government itself. As a result, the old laughing stock\nline about backwards tech at government agencies is no more. Today government\nis a main purchaser of tech services and is a top driver of the AI boom too.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the best-kept secrets in American public life, hardly talked about\nat all by mainstream media. Most people still think of tech companies as free-\nenterprise rebels. It\u2019s not true.\n\nThe same situation of course exists for pharmaceutical companies. This\nrelationship dates even further back in time and is even tighter to the point\nthat there is no real distinction between the interests of the FDA/CDC and\nlarge pharmaceutical companies. They are one and the same.\n\nIn this framework, we might also tag the agricultural sector, which is\ndominated by cartels that have driven out family farms. It\u2019s a government plan\nand massive subsidies that determine what is produced and in what quantity.\nIt\u2019s not because of consumers that your Coke is filled with a scary product\ncalled \u201chigh fructose corn syrup,\u201d why your candy bar and danish have the\nsame, and why there is corn in your gas tank. This is entirely the product of\ngovernment agencies and budgets.\n\nIn free enterprise, the old rule is that the customer is always right. That\u2019s\na wonderful system sometimes called consumer sovereignty. Its advent in\nhistory, dating perhaps from the 16th century, represented a tremendous\nadvance over the old guild system of feudalism and certainly a major step over\nancient despotisms. It\u2019s been the rallying cry of market-based economics ever\nsince.\n\nWhat happens, however, when government itself becomes a main and even dominant\ncustomer? The ethos of private enterprise is thereby changed. No longer\nprimarily interested in serving the general public, enterprise turns its\nattention to serving its powerful masters in the halls of the state, gradually\nweaving close relationships and forming a ruling class that becomes a\nconspiracy against the public.\n\nThis used to go by the name \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d which perhaps describes some of\nthe problems on a small scale. This is another level of reality that needs an\nentirely different name. That name is corporatism, a coinage from the 1930s\nand a synonym for fascism back before that became a curse word due to wartime\nalliances. Corporatism is a specific thing, not capitalism and not socialism\nbut a system of private property ownership with cartelized industry that\nprimarily serves the state.\n\nThe old binaries of the public and private sector \u2013 widely assumed by every\nmain ideological system \u2013have become so blurred that they no longer make much\nsense. And yet we are ideologically and philosophically unprepared to deal\nwith this new world with anything like intellectual insight. Not only that, it\ncan be extremely difficult even to tell the good guys from the bad guys in the\nnews stream. We hardly know anymore for whom to cheer or boo in the great\nstruggles of our time.\n\nThat\u2019s how mixed up everything has become. We\u2019ve clearly traveled a long way\nfrom the 1990s!\n\nSome might observe that this has been a problem far back in time. Starting\nwith the Spanish-American War, we\u2019ve seen a merger of public and private as\ninvolving the munitions industry.\n\nThis is true. Many Gilded Age fortunes were wholly legitimate and market-based\nenterprises but others were gathered from the nascent military-industrial\ncomplex that began to mature in the Great War and involved a vast range of\nindustries from industry to transportation to communications.\n\nOf course in 1913, we saw the advent of a particularly egregious public-\nprivate partnership with the Federal Reserve, in which private banks merged\ninto a unified front and agreed to service US government debt obligations in\nexchange for bailout guarantees. This monetary corporatism continues to vex us\nto this day, as does the military industrial complex.\n\nHow is it different from the past? It\u2019s different in degree and reach. The\ncorporatist machine now manages the main products and services in our civilian\nlife including the entire way we get information, how we work, how we bank,\nhow we contact friends, and how we buy. It is the manager of the whole of our\nlives in every respect, and has become the driving force of product innovation\nand design. It has become a tool for surveillance in the most intimate aspects\nof our lives, including financial information and inclusive of listening\ndevices we\u2019ve willingly installed in our own homes.\n\nIn other words, this is no longer just about private companies providing the\nbullets and bombs for both sides in a foreign war and obtaining the rebuilding\ncontracts after. The military-industrial complex has come home, expanded to\neverything, and invaded every aspect of our lives.\n\nIt has become a main curator and censor of our news and social media presence\nand postings. It is in a position to say which companies and products succeed\nand which ones fail. It can kill apps in a flash if the well-placed person\ndoes not like what it is doing. It can order other apps to add or subtract to\na blacklist based on political opinions. It can tell even the smallest company\nto comply or face death by lawfare. It can seize on any individual and make\nhim a public enemy based entirely on an opinion or action that runs contrary\nto regime priorities.\n\nIn short, this corporatism \u2013 in all its iterations including the regulatory\nstate and the patent war chest that maintains and enforces monopoly \u2013 is the\ncore source of all the current despotism.\n\nIt obtained its first full trial run with the lockdowns of 2020, when tech\ncompanies and media joined in the ear-splitting propaganda campaigns to\nshelter in place, cancel holidays, and not visit grandma in the hospital and\nnursing home. It cheered as millions of small businesses were destroyed and\nbig-box stores thrived as distributors of approved products, while vast swaths\nof the workforce were called nonessential and put on welfare.\n\nThis was the corporatist state at work, with a large corporate sector wholly\nacquiescent to regime priority and a government fully dedicated to rewarding\nits industrial partners in every sector that went along with the political\npriority at the moment. The trigger for the construction of the vast machinery\nthat rules our lives was far back in time and always begins the same way: with\na seemingly inauspicious government contract.\n\nHow well I recall those days in the 1990s when public schools first started to\nbuy computers from Microsoft. Did alarm bells go off? Not for me. I had a\ntypical attitude of any pro-business libertarian: whatever business wants to\ndo, it should do. Surely it is up to the enterprise to sell to all willing\nbuyers, even if that includes governments. In any case, how in the world would\none prevent this? Government contracting with private business has been the\nnorm from time immemorial. No harm done.\n\nAnd yet it turns out that vast harm was done. This was just the beginning of\nwhat became one of the world\u2019s largest industries, far more powerful and\ndecisive over industrial organization than old-fashioned producer-to-consumer\nmarkets. Adam Smith\u2019s \u201cbutcher, baker, and brewery\u201d have been crowded out by\nthe very business conspiracies against which he gravely warned. These gigantic\nfor-profit and public trading corporations became the operational foundation\nof the surveillance-driven corporatist complex.\n\nWe are nowhere near coming to terms with the implications of this. It goes way\nbeyond and fully transcends the old debates between capitalism and socialism.\nIndeed that is not what this is about. The focus on that might be\ntheoretically interesting but it has little or no relevance to the current\nreality in which public and private have fully merged and intruded into every\naspect of our lives, and with fully predictable results: economic decline for\nthe many and riches for the few.\n\nThis is also why neither the left nor the right, nor Democrats or Republicans,\nnor capitalists or socialists, seem to be speaking clearly to the moment in\nwhich we live. The dominating force on both the national and global scene\ntoday is techno-corporatism that intrudes itself into our food, our medicine,\nour media, our information flows, our homes, and all the way down to the\nhundreds of surveillance tools that we carry around in our pockets.\n\nI truly wish these companies were genuinely private, but they are not. They\nare de facto state actors. More precisely, they all work hand-in-glove and\nwhich is the hand and which is the glove is no longer clear.\n\nComing to terms with this intellectually is the major challenge of our times.\nDealing with it juridically and politically seems like a much more daunting\ntask, to say the least. The problem is complicated by the drive to purge\nserious dissent at all levels of society. How did American capitalism become\nAmerican corporatism?
