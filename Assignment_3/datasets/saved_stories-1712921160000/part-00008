NDC : Nature and Dynamics of a Crowd is part 1/3 of this series.\n\nVibhav Bobade\n\nApr 11, 2024\n\nShare this post\n\n#### CaP NDC-01: Essence, Formation, and Movement of Crowds 1\n\nwaveywaves.substack.com\n\nShare\n\n> The following analysis is done to understand and simulate different concepts\n> presented in the book Crowds and Power by Elias Canetti.\n\n##### About Elias Canetti\n\nElias Canetti won a Nobel Prize in Literature for \"for writings marked by a\nbroad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power\". Crowds and Power\nbeautifully delves into the nature and dynamics of Crowds with through\nreligions and cultures across the world throughout history.\n\n##### Introduction to this newsletter series of Crowds and Power and the\ninitial focus on Crowds\n\nThe first in this series of analyzing Crowds and Power, we are going to\nexplore the basic nature, formation and dynamics of a crowd. Here, Canetti\nshowcases crowds to have a life of their own. The concept of a Crowd itself\nbeing the main topic in discussion here. In later parts of this series we will\nexplore the aspect of Power through Crowds.\n\n##### What is it going to be like trying to understand the concepts in this\nbook ?\n\nTrying to understand these concepts will look like a person trying to figure\nout how different groups of ants work together. Each group of ants here has a\nspecific job and the survival of these ants depends on how well they can\ncollaborate and understand the other groups\u2019 dynamics. Here the group is a\nCrowd.\n\nHuman society being a complex structure of cultures doesn\u2019t enjoy the luxury\nof simple subdivisions used to explain the hierarchies in an ant colony. Due\nto this complexity, we are first going to try and understand how these\ndifferent groups or Crowds are formed and what their collective behavior looks\nlike.\n\nLet\u2019s try to understand the nature of an individual before they become part of\na crowd.\n\n#\n\nThe state of an individual before joining a crowd\n\n##### The state of fear\n\nThe initial state of an individual before they are part of a crowd is the\nstate of fear. In this state the individual\u2019s personal space is not to be\ntrifled with. It is a state in which the individual is most comfortable and\ntheir surroundings are no one else\u2019s but their own. This can translate into\nthe individual\u2019s safe space.\n\nWhen there is a breach in this space, the individual can retaliate. Canetti\ncalls this state, The Fear of Being Touched.\n\n##\n\nThe Fear of Being Touched\n\nBefore an individual becomes part of a crowd, they reside in a space where\nthey feel most safe and content. We explore this aspect of space and of\nbreaching the space with the p5.js sketch below. We shall try to explore and\nunderstand all the concepts in this book in the same way.\n\n##### Introduction to the Sketch (1)\n\nThe following sketch demonstrates an individual establishing a Minimum\nDistance which they try to maintain from the other individuals in the scene.\nWith this we can simulate the idea of safe space. If anyone else breaches this\nspace, the individual retaliates with a\n\n> \u201cew, get away !\u201d\n\nexpressing displeasure. Ever so mild displeasure of someone barging into your\nroom without knocking. The mouse cursor below is a movable individual with\nwhom we try to breach the personal space of others. What fun ?! Right ?!! This\nindividual, who is backed by the mouse cursor has their head is falling off\nand kind of looks like Nearly Headless Nick.\n\n###\n\nSketch 1.1: Fear of Being Touched (attacking personal space)\n\n##### Parameters of the Sketch\n\nApart from Minimum Distance parameter, we have Number of Particles as the\nother relevant parameter in this sketch. Rest of the parameters are animation\nand rendering related.\n\n##### Understanding Minimum Distance\n\nAs the other stick figures disperse when the mouse comes close to them, each\nindividual who\u2019s private space is breached says, \u201cew, get away !\u201d. This\nreaction is completely acceptable when the person going around is literally\nholding their head in their hands.\n\n> The above picture shows how each individual above has established their safe\n> space by maintaining minimum distance.\n\n##### Repulsion\n\nThis sketch helps us understand the initial state of a person and the\nunwillingness to let go of personal space, which is important to them. Each\nindividual is in a state of flux and disorientation of some sort at this\npoint. This is because, at any point if anyone else is too close to an\nindividual, their initial reaction is to repel. As the individuals disperse\nand bump into the rest of the crowd, the other individuals react, causing mass\nhysteria which is resembled by the red glows which we see.\n\n> The circles around the individuals represent their minimum distance. During\n> repulsion, the individual retaliates by moving in the opposite director of\n> disturbance trying to establish their safe space again.\n\n##### Increasing personal space to an extent where co-existence becomes\nproblematic \u2192 Introduction to Sketch (1.2)\n\nIn the simulation below, we are increasing the minimum distance required by\neach stick figure to be kept from each other and as we trigger this behavior\nwe see some interesting effects.\n\n###\n\nSketch 1.2: Fear of Being Touched (when too many people need too much personal\nspace)\n\n##### Updating the Minimum Distance parameter\n\nIn the above example we update the Minimum Distance parameter value to 100\nfrom 50. This is double the amount from the previous time causing each of the\nindividuals to require double the amount of safe space they require. This\ncauses each person goes in a frenzy in a small space trying to keep distance\nfrom each other.\n\n##### Too much personal space\n\nEach individual in the above sketch is now actively trying to move away from\neveryone else at all times and because of this no individual is able to return\nto a place of calm. The personal space required by each person is too much.\nThis is causing a mass hysteria where not enough space can be occupied by any\nof the people, making all of them struggle in place.\n\n> The necessity to draw bounds beyond what might be more than what everyone\n> can afford together causes all individuals to continuously struggle.\n\n##### Personal space and privilege\n\nOn a more pensive note, the characteristics and the amount of personal space\nrequired by a person can be a product of nature or nurture. Different\nsocieties and classes within these societies would have different experiences\nof personal space.\n\nSomeone who grew up in the slums where families of more than 4-5 would live in\na small space would say that the personal space nurtured by a well to do\nindividual could be enough for the whole family. Someone who has never had to\ndo a day\u2019s of work to live a good life would find the idea of 5 people staying\nin one room to be appalling.\n\nThis makes us think a little more deeply about how privilege and the bounds of\nan individual\u2019s personal space as a product of nature or nurture.\n\n##### Transition from the state of fear to that of being a part of a crowd\n\nNow that we have looked at how an individual functions when they aren\u2019t a part\nof a Crowd and when they are in the state of fear (The Fear of Being Touched),\nwe can now move forward to understand how the same individual could join a\nCrowd and become one with a group of people. When an individual is part of a\nCrowd, the fear has dissipated and they act in the spirit of the crowd. As\nlong as the Crowd has a goal, it shall be together and work together and keep\nthe individuals of the Crowd engaged, with everyone moving towards the same\ngoal.\n\nIn the next post we will delve into The Essence and Formation of Crowds. We\nwill try to understand how Crowds are formed and how depending on a lot of\ninternal and external factors the life or a Crowd is determined.\n\nIf you like the simulation you see above, subscribe to get access to more\ninteractive simulations including the one presented above.
