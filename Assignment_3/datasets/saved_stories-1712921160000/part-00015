However, LLMs are vulnerable to different types of\n> attacks, such as jailbreaking, prompt injection attacks, and privacy leakage\n> attacks. Foundational LLMs undergo adversarial and alignment training to\n> learn not to generate malicious and toxic content. For specialized use\n> cases, these foundational LLMs are subjected to fine-tuning or quantization\n> for better performance and efficiency. We examine the impact of downstream\n> tasks such as fine-tuning and quantization on LLM vulnerability. We test\n> foundation models like Mistral, Llama, MosaicML, and their fine-tuned\n> versions. Our research shows that fine-tuning and quantization reduces\n> jailbreak resistance significantly, leading to increased LLM\n> vulnerabilities. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of external guardrails\n> in reducing LLM vulnerabilities.\n\nSubjects:| Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.04392 [cs.CR]  \n(or arXiv:2404.04392v1 [cs.CR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.04392arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Divyanshu Kumar [view email] [v1] Fri, 5 Apr 2024 20:31:45 UTC (1,440\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Increased LLM Vulnerabilities from Fine-tuning\nand Quantization, by Divyanshu Kumar and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
