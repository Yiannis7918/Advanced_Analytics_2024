You know barely a week goes by without some\n> new announcement, and if you look at the amount of AI hardware, the\n> computers coming online that are dedicated to AI, that is increasing what\n> looks like at least by a factor of 10 every year, if not every 6 to nine\n> months. So when you combine the hardware coming online really an order of\n> magnitude increase every you know\u2014call it at least every nine months\u2014and\n> many, many software breakthroughs, if you look at that curve it looks\n> insane. My guess is that we'll have AI that is smarter than any one human\n> probably around the end of next year, and then AI, the total amount of sort\n> of sentient compute of AI, I think will probably exceed all humans in 5\n> years.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t buy the predictions for the next year1, and just said as much on X:\n\nMoments later, Damion Hankejh, Investor and CEO of ingk.com, offered to up the\nbet to $10 million. Are you in?\n\nBest,\n\nGary\n\nGary Marcus first suggested in 2016 that outliers would be a serious and\ndifficult-to-overcome challenge for driverless cars, and first anticipated\nhallucinations in large neural networks in 2001.\n\nMarcus on AI is a reader-supported publication.
