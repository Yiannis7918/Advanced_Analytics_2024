Amazon envisioned tens of thousands of software developers\nbuilding valued abilities for Alexa that would grow the voice assistant's\npopularity\u2014and help Amazon make some money.\n\nBut about seven years after launching a rewards program to encourage\ndevelopers to build Skills, Alexa's most preferred abilities are the basic\nones, like checking the weather. And on June 30, Amazon will stop giving out\nthe monthly Amazon Web Services credits that have made it free for third-party\ndevelopers to build and host Alexa Skills. The company also recently told devs\nthat its Alexa Developer Rewards program was ending, virtually\ndisincentivizing third-party devs to build for Alexa.\n\n## Death knell for third-party Alexa apps\n\nThe news has left dozens of Alexa Skills developers wondering if they have a\nfuture with Alexa, especially as Amazon preps a generative AI and\nsubscription-based version of Alexa. \"Dozens\" may sound like a dig at Alexa's\necosystem, but it's an estimation based on a podcast from Skills developers\nMark Tucker and Allen Firstenberg, who, in a recent podcast, agreed that\n\"dozens\" of third-party devs were contemplating if it's still worthwhile to\ndevelop Alexa skills. The casual summary wasn't stated as a hard fact or\nconfirmed by Amazon but, rather, seemed like a rough and quick estimation\nbased on the developers' familiarity with the Skills community. But with such\nminimal interest and money associated with Skills, dozens isn't an implausible\nfigure either.\n\nAmazon admitted that there's little interest in its Skills incentives\nprograms. Bloomberg reported that \"fewer than 1 percent of developers were\nusing the soon-to-end programs,\" per Amazon spokesperson Lauren Raemhild.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Today, with over 160,000 skills available for customers and a well-\nestablished Alexa developer community, these programs have run their course,\nand we decided to sunset them,\" she told the publication.\n\nThe writing on the wall, though, is that Amazon doesn't have the incentive or\nmoney to grow the Alexa app ecosystem it once imagined. Voice assistants\nlargely became money pits, and the Alexa division has endured recent layoffs\nas it fights for survival and relevance. Meanwhile, Google Assistant stopped\nusing third-party apps in 2022.\n\n\"Many developers are now going to need to make some tough decisions about\nmaintaining existing or creating future experiences on Alexa,\" Tucker said via\na LinkedIn post.\n\n## Alexa Skills criticized as \u201cuseless\u201d\n\nAs of this writing, the top Alexa skills, in order, are: Jeopardy, Are You\nSmarter Than a 5th Grader?, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, and Calm. That's\nnot exactly a futuristic list of must-have technological feats. For years,\npeople have wondered when the \"killer app\" would come to catapult Alexa's\npopularity. But now it seems like Alexa's only hope at that killer use case is\ngenerative AI (a gamble filled with its own obstacles).\n\nBut like Amazon, third-party developers found it hard to make money off\nSkills, with a rare few pointing to making thousands of dollars at most and\nthe vast majority not making anything.\n\n\"If you can't make money off it, no one's going to seriously engage,\" Joseph\n\"Jo\" Jaquinta, a developer who had made over 12 Skills, told CNET in 2017.\n\nBy 2018, Amazon had paid developers millions to grow Alexa Skills. But by\n2020, Amazon reduced the amount of money it paid out to third-party\ndevelopers, an anonymous source told Bloomberg, The source noted that the apps\nmade by paid developers weren't making the company much money. Come 2024, the\nmost desirable things you can make Alexa do remain basic tasks, like playing a\nsong and apparently trivia games.\n\nAmazon hasn't said it's ending Skills. That would seem premature considering\nthat its Alexa chatbot isn't expected until June. Developers can still make\nmoney off Skills with in-app purchases, but the incentive is minimal.\n\n\"Developers like you have and will play a critical role in the success of\nAlexa, and we appreciate your continued engagement,\" Amazon's notice to devs\nsaid, per Bloomberg.\n\nWe'll see how \"critical\" Amazon treats those remaining developers once its\ngenerative AI chatbot is ready.\n\n#### reader comments\n\n54\n\nScharon Harding Scharon is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Product Reviewer writing\nnews, reviews, and analysis on consumer technology, including laptops,\nmechanical keyboards, and monitors.
