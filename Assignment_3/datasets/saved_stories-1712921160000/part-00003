Meanwhile, 35% said the opposite is true.\n\nSmaller FIs appeared to be more receptive to providing open banking-supported\nservices, with nearly 2 in 5 saying the benefits of doing so outweighed any\nrisks. Conversely, more than half of the largest FIs surveyed \u2014 those managing\nmore than $100 billion in assets \u2014 said the risks overshadowed any benefits.\n\nOne takeaway from these findings is that smaller FIs likely see their support\nof open banking as a competitive differentiator. Larger FIs, meanwhile, simply\nhave more to lose.\n\nThe prospect of losses weighs heavily in the open banking debate. PYMNTS\nIntelligence\u2019s data showed concerns about fraud were a major determinant in\nwhether FIs were open to open banking or not.\n\nWhere 46% of FIs in general said open banking risks outweighed any benefits,\nfor institutions that saw an increase in fraud volumes, the stakes appeared to\nbe higher, with 57% of them saying the risk of open banking was too high. But\n45% of those FIs that experienced a decline in fraud volumes felt the same\nway, saying the risks outweighed the rewards.\n\nWith 62% of large FIs reporting increases in financial crimes, it\u2019s little\nwonder that FIs, especially larger ones, are reluctant to fully embrace open\nbanking at this time.\n\n#### Recommended\n\nFI Execs Curb Their Enthusiasm for Open Banking\n\nSettle CEO Says GenAI Expedites Cash Flow Management\n\nShare of Credit Card Accounts Past Due Hits 12-Year High\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman Seeking Global Support for AI Infrastructure\n\nSee More In: Banks, data, data brief, Featured News, FinTech, fraud, News,\nOpen Banking, PYMNTS Intelligence, PYMNTS News, PYMNTS Study, Security, The\nData Point\n\n# Investigation Into Morgan Stanley\u2019s Wealth Arm Underscores Scrutiny of AML\nand Onboarding Efforts\n\nBy PYMNTS | April 11, 2024\n\n|\n\nAnti-money laundering (AML) defenses might begin at the point of onboarding.\n\nThe needs are for all manner of firms \u2014 and especially banks and investment\nmanagement companies \u2014 to embrace technology in the service of beefing up\ntheir onboarding processes and automating them too.\n\nMedia sites including The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Thursday that\nU.S. regulators are examining Morgan Stanley\u2019s anti-money laundering efforts.\n\nThe scrutiny comes from a broad range of regulators, ranging from the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission to the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency.\n\nSpecifically, the agencies are reportedly looking for information on some\nclients based outside the U.S. \u2014 and in some cases, business done with Morgan\nStanley even after those customers had been reportedly cut off by E*Trade, the\ndigital-trading platform the company acquired by Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe OCC has reportedly sent Morgan Stanley a \u201cmatter requiring attention\u201d\nnotice regarding its controls and procedures. And per the report from WSJ,\nMorgan Stanley has responded to regulators\u2019 concerns by compliance, technology\nand artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n## FinCEN Looks Toward Modernization\n\nNews of the Morgan Stanley examination comes in the wake of reports at the end\nof last month that the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) requested\ncomments on its Customer Identification Program (CIP) requirements for banks.\n\nComments submitted in response to the request will also help FinCEN identify\nregulations and guidance that may be outdated. And as reported, over a\n14-month period in 2021 and 2022, FinCEN imposed more than $600 million in\nfines for AML violations.\n\nEarlier this year, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) added new countries\nto its \u201cincreased monitoring\u201d list. The recent revisions included Kenya and\nNamibia on that list while removing Barbados, Gibraltar, Uganda and the United\nArab Emirates (UAE).\n\nPYMNTS Intelligence has found that more than 40% of financial institutions are\nseeing increasing volumes of fraud and financial crime. Research done in\ncollaboration with Hawk AI finds that 7 in 10 told us they now are using AI\nand machine learning to battle bad actors. Uncovering whether someone is who\nthey say they are is critical. Separate data show that 4.6% of transactions\nwere classified as synthetic identity fraud.\n\nAnd, per the Fed\u2019s FraudClassifier model, synthetic IDs accounted for a\ncommensurate percentage of dollar losses experienced by FIs.\n\nAs detailed here, in joint efforts between PYMNTS and Featurespace, 200\nexecutives from a range of FIs with assets of at least $5 billion revealed\nheightened awareness about money laundering and other financial fraud \u2014 and\nthe need for innovation to detect and prevent it. Ninety-five percent of AML\nexecutives said they consider it a \u201chigh priority\u201d to use advanced\ntechnologies in those efforts.\n\nAI is increasingly at the forefront of those efforts. In one example, Oracle\nFinancial Services introduced an AI-powered cloud service that helps banks\nmitigate AML risks. The new Oracle Financial Services Compliance Agent\n\u201cidentifies and remediates vulnerabilities,\u201d the company said in its\nannouncement.\n\n#### Recommended\n\nInvestigation Into Morgan Stanley\u2019s Wealth Arm Underscores Scrutiny of AML and\nOnboarding Efforts\n\nWhy It Seems Like Every AI Company is Making Their Own Chip\n\nRappi Getting Ready for IPO \u2018When It Makes Sense\u2019\n\nVerituity Taps Mastercard to Enable Near-Real-Time Payments for Banks\n\nSee More In: AML, Anti-Money Laundering, financial crimes enforcement network,\nFinCEN, Morgan Stanley, News, OC&C, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,\nOnboarding, PYMNTS News, SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission, security &\nfraud\n\n#### Trending News\n\nInvestigation Into Morgan Stanley\u2019s Wealth Arm Underscores Scrutiny of AML and\nOnboarding Efforts\n\nWhy It Seems Like Every AI Company is Making Their Own Chip\n\nRappi Getting Ready for IPO \u2018When It Makes Sense\u2019\n\n#### The Big Story\n\nDeutsche Bank Says Embedded Finance Is Changing Business Models\n\n#### Featured News\n\nCHIPS ISO 20022 Migration Means Smoother Cross-Border Activity\n\nOrchestration Merchants Give Options for Who, How and Where to Pay, Spreedly\nSays\n\nAnalytical Focus Moves CFOs From Bookkeepers to Business Partners\n\nFI Execs Curb Their Enthusiasm for Open Banking\n\nSettle CEO Says GenAI Expedites Cash Flow Management\n\nWill Virtual Card Numbers Spark a Rush to Spend Apple Cash?\n\nJust in Time for Summer: Apparel and Dining Out Get More Expensive\n\n#### Subscribe\n\nAn error occurred.
