Today's guests, Jennifer Erickson and Greg Segal, argue a\ngovernment-enabled monopoly is the culprit.\n\nWe spoke with Erickson and Segal about how they successfully advocated for\nmajor fixes to the organ donation network. Erickson is a Senior Fellow with\nthe Federation of American Scientists and former Assistant Director of\nInnovation for Growth in the White House Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy. Segal is the founder and CEO of Organize, a nonprofit patient advocacy\ngroup.\n\n##\n\nWhat you\u2019ll learn:\n\n  * Why are 28,000 organs going untransplanted annually?\n\n  * Why does 1% of the federal budget go to dialysis?\n\n  * Why has a sole bidder run the U.S. transplant system for decades?\n\n[Thanks to Rita Sokolova for her judicious transcript edits.]\n\n####\n\nTell me about organs.\n\nJennifer Erickson: What I will say out of the gate about the organ waiting\nlist is that it alternatingly makes me want to turn over the table, it makes\nme so angry because it's unnecessary. But then also the great thing is, this\nis actually a healthcare problem that we can fix. The problem, it turns out,\nis actually the federal contractors.\n\nSo who are the contractors? First, there are 55 local contractors. These are\ncalled organ procurement organizations or OPOs. Some have a state as their\ndonation service area, some are across part of a state.\n\nCongress set up a monopoly contract in the eighties, called the Organ\nProcurement Transplantation Network, or OPTN. This national contract has only\never been held by one contractor, the United Network for Organ Sharing. If\nyou've seen Grey's Anatomy or ER and they said \u201cI need a heart, get UNOS on\nthe phone,\u201d that's UNOS.\n\nJust one example again of how bad it is: Greg and I recently got a\nwhistleblower call in the last heat wave. Someone took a liver, a human liver\nthat a family said yes to on the worst day of their life because a loved one\ndied in an accident, and left it at the wrong hospital\u2019s cargo bay in 90\ndegree heat, and no one noticed for an hour and a half.\n\nThe OPTN has a board to set policy. Who's on the board right now? The current\nboard, the board members of the nation's Organ Procurement Transplantation\nNetwork, were until recently the exact same board members for the contractor,\nUNOS. So, literally, they would meet on a Sunday as OPTN board members and\nthen on a Monday as UNOS board members.\n\nTo say it's a conflict is an understatement: it's a Venn diagram that just is\none circle. It's really, really bad. So as a first thing, this legacy board is\nstill deciding policy for the nation. There are ongoing, bipartisan\nCongressional investigations into conflicts of interest and corruption.\n\nThe tech is so bad. The United States Digital Service found 17 days of\ndowntime in recent years. Until recently, the algorithm that was protecting\nall organ donor patient information in the country, so STI status, mental\nhealth, every physical history, was from 1996.\n\nThis is a fixable problem: it\u2019s about the contractor, supply chain, it\u2019s\nlogistics, transparency. Congress unanimously passed a bill in July. The only\nother thing that passed unanimously that day was Tony Bennett Day.\n\nSenator Todd Young, a Republican from Indiana, who lost a friend waiting for a\nheart, has done a lot of oversight into OPOs, including the OPO in Indiana.\nAnd in one year of that oversight \u2014 this has been peer reviewed and published\n\u2014 organ donation in the state of Indiana went up by 44 percent. It went up by\n44 percent because they approached 57 percent more families. What in the hell\nwas that government contractor doing before Todd Young started asking\nquestions?\n\n####\n\nYou mentioned the specific language of the law solidified UNOS as the sole\nbidder for the OPTN contract. What was that exact language?\n\nJE: The predecessor organization to UNOS lobbied heavily to insert language\ninto the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) that stipulated that, to compete\nfor this contract, a contractor has to be an independent nonprofit with\nexpertise in organ donation and transplantation. That phrase has always been\ninterpreted to mean UNOS. In 2018, the last time there was an open contracting\ncycle, you had to have three years of experience to even submit a bid to the\nfederal government. Now, that might sound sensible until you realize that\nthere\u2019s a national monopoly and only one group has ever had three years of\nexperience. So no one else applied.\n\nThe United States Digital Service produced a report called Lives are at Stake,\nwhich is not a normal name for a government report. It's a way of writing it\nin flashing red letters. They identified that phrase in NOTA as one that has\nrestricted competition across decades, and in the summer of 2023, both the\nSenate and the House unanimously passed the Securing the U.S. Organ\nProcurement and Transplantation Network Act, which removed it. President Biden\nsigned that into law in September.\n\nIt was surprising even to Greg and me how this news broke through in the\nnational media, but I think it was because Americans inherently know that\nmonopolies are bad and no one, unless you're in this very particular world of\norgan donation, was aware that there was a national organ monopoly and that\nthey were funding as taxpayers, and which has spectacularly failed patients.\n\n####\n\nA lot of Americans are affected by the organ donation system every year. Help\nme understand why this successful bipartisan push didn't happen 10 years\nearlier.\n\nJE: I think one really important thing to know is that these organ donation\ncontractors are funded by the taxpayer. Organ procurement is cost reimbursed,\nwhich means that pretty much anything organ procurement organizations pay for\ngets reimbursed by readers, by taxpayers.\n\nFrom Organ Donation Reform\n\nThat\u2019s how you end up with organ contractor executives flying around on\nprivate jets and going to Sonoma wine retreats while the Centers for Medicare\n& Medicaid Services (CMS) say they're failing basic government performance\nmetrics. If you're really worried about which vineyard you take your board to,\nyou're probably not spending a ton of time thinking about how to staff\nunderserved hospitals in the middle of the night.\n\nI think the system has stayed broken for so long because they had budgets to\nmarket themselves. There\u2019s a halo effect here: 95% of Americans support organ\ndonation. That literally polls higher than puppies and ice cream. So there's\nthis tremendous amount of goodwill that the organ contractors not only benefit\nfrom, but actively pay to perpetuate through good news stories, by sponsoring\nthe Rose Bowl and professional sports teams. And despite wild executive perks\nand abuse of funds, these contractors are nominally nonprofits.\n\nSo no one was ever looking under the hood. And I really want to give credit to\nGreg here. When I was in the Obama administration in the White House Office of\nScience and Technology Policy, Greg\u2019s organization brought us data showing\n28,000 organs going unrecovered every year, showing which organs were going\nunrecovered in which states. That put it into technicolor for us that we had\nnot only a preventable, outrageous tragedy and a responsibility to actually\nfix it and prevent it. Greg and the researchers that he worked with showed\nthat there are 17,500 kidneys, 7,500 livers, 1,500 hearts, and 1,500 lungs\nthat go untransplanted every year from potential American organ donors. For\nscale, that means the United States does not need to have a waiting list for\nlivers, hearts, or lungs within three years, and the kidney waiting list\nshould come way down. That data convinced not only the Obama administration,\nbut also the Trump administration. This reform movement has now crossed three\nadministrations, and that almost never happens.\n\n####\n\nGreg, where did you get that data? How was it generated and understood to the\npoint where you could take it to the White House?\n\nGreg Segal: So our organization, Organize, was awarded the Innovator in\nResidence position in the secretary's office of the U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services (HHS) from 2015 to 2016. We were still technically a non-\ngovernmental nonprofit, but in some sense, we were embedded within HHS.\n\nWe had different levels of data access and we used ICD-9 codes, which have\nsince been revised to ICD-10, to paint an objective picture of how well, or in\nmany cases, how poorly, these industry stakeholders were performing. Many\npeople probably directionally knew that something was amiss in this system,\nbut it was very opaque. Before having this data, it was hard to articulate\nwhat was going on to members of Congress, and you sometimes felt like you were\nChristopher Lloyd from Back to the Future, where you're just the forensic\naccountant or crazy person in the office.\n\n####\n\nGet more specific for me on that data collection; some of our readers are\nnerds for this stuff. Can you access that as a private citizen, or did being\nembedded as Innovator-in-Residence unlock it?\n\nGS: We could access it as private citizens, but HHS employees really helped us\nunderstand why things were set up the way that they were, how things were\ncoded, and which one of our ten ideas might actually be implementable. As\nJennifer always says, government works by analogy. We had so many different\nideas, and then civil servants would very soberly explain to us why nine of\nthem were just completely unfeasible. When you're left with the one idea, that\ndoes not guarantee that it will happen. We then needed help understanding the\nten different analogous projects that have happened in the last ten years to\nfigure out how to implement ours.\n\nSo we used government data, and we validated it with some external data\nvoluntarily shared from industry to verify that what we were doing was\ndirectionally correct with what was happening in industry.\n\nJE: One of the things that really helped was the specificity. There had\npreviously been federally funded research showing that in the United States as\nfew as one in five organ donors were having their organs recovered. So four in\nfive were not, right?\n\nWe knew that there was a gap between the huge support for organ donation and\nwhat was actually happening. What I\u2019ve learned is that if there\u2019s a big\nnational problem, the government often does exactly the wrong thing. It punts,\nit does another big study, a consensus conference.\n\nWhat you really need to understand is the data: what is happening in the state\nof Virginia, what's happening across Texas or California. There are 55 of\nthese organ procurement organizations, and we found a 470% variability in\nrecovery between the top performers and the lowest performers. You need to\nask, \u201cWhat are the top performers doing that the bottom performers are not?\u201d\nThat really helps you get specific and follow the data to find problems you\ncan solve.\n\n####\n\nTalk to me a little bit about the 17,500 untransplanted kidneys. Where are\nthose kidneys, what is happening to them?\n\nJE: So keep in mind, there's a huge generosity of spirit and national\nagreement about organ donation. Most people, myself included before I started\nthis work, think of organ donation as, \u201cDid you tick a box at the DMV when you\ngot a driver's license?\u201d And that really isn't the story of what happens.\n\nIn the United States, only 2-3% percent of deaths are organ donation-eligible.\nThat includes car and motorcycle accidents, overdoses, strokes, and traumas:\nsomething that means a patient isn't going to make it, but up to eight of\ntheir organs might. When someone is dying in an organ donation-eligible way,\nthat hospital calls the organ procurement organization they're assigned to.\nThat OPO is supposed to turn up to every potential case in a timely and\ncompassionate way and have one of two conversations with the family:\n\n\u201cSmith family, I'm so sorry for your loss. Jane was a registered organ donor.\nWe'd like to proceed with her wishes.\u201d\n\nOr, \u201cSmith family, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Jane seemed like a wonderful\nperson. Can we talk to you about organ donation?\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that 95% of Americans support organ donation. My older brother is\na registered organ donor, and if, God forbid, something happened to him, and\nsomeone approached me at the hospital in a timely and compassionate way, I\nwould consent to organ donation. If they do not approach me, then I cannot\nconsent. If they do not show up at the hospital, even if he ticked the box at\nthe DMV, those organs cannot be recovered.\n\nAnother problem is that when they do show up, OPOs are not required to have\nbasic standards of clinical care. So another way in which organs are lost is\nmedical mistakes.\n\nOrgans are literally lost and damaged in transit every single week. The OPTN\ncontractor is 15 times more likely to lose or damage an organ in transit than\nan airline is a suitcase. That should be shocking. Think about a donor family\nagreeing to organ donation on the worst day of their life, and what it means\nif their loved one's kidney gets left on the airport counter in Atlanta, or\ngets delayed and then thrown in the trash in another part of the country. And\nthen, of course, what that means to one of the 100,000 Americans waiting to\nget that call for a lifesaving transplant.\n\nGS: I\u2019ll also share a lesson on advocacy. There's a rare genetic condition in\nmy family which causes heart failure. My dad and aunt had heart transplants,\nanother aunt died waiting for her transplant. I spent a lot of time running\naround D.C., talking to people about the organ donation system, and had a lot\nof sympathetic meetings where people heard me out. I think I convinced them\nthat I was right, and then they moved on to the next meeting and never thought\nabout me again.\n\nThen I realized that kidneys are not only just as important as hearts, but far\nmore expensive to taxpayers. If you need a kidney, you are almost certainly\nwaiting on dialysis, which is then paid for by Medicare. In 2019, treatment\nfor kidney failure cost Medicare $36 billion \u2014 it might be higher now, and is\ncertainly higher if you include Medicaid numbers and VA numbers.\n\nOne percent of the entire federal budget goes to dialysis. So we started\nforegrounding kidneys in our advocacy, but reform to the kidney donation\nsystem, at least the deceased donation system, is a vehicle for the same\nreforms for all of the organ categories. After we started talking about the\nimportance of helping people get kidney transplants, within a year or two,\nthere was a presidential directive on reforming the organ donation system that\nrode on the Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health.\n\nI was so blinded by telling my story that I didn't think for a while about\nwhat's actually going to resonate most with a person across the table from me.\nAnd in D.C., often that is not just who has the most sympathetic issue, but\nwhose issue has a pay-for to it.\n\n####\n\nWhy are kidneys eligible for cost reimbursement?\n\nJE: There are two areas of healthcare that are still under cost reimbursement,\nwhich means the taxpayer funds the vast majority of the system: critical\naccess hospitals and organ procurement. As Greg alluded to, because of some\namazing patient advocacy in the 1970s, kidneys have a unique classification\nand end-stage renal disease is the only major disease that qualifies you for\nMedicare regardless of age. In 1971, a patient was dialyzed on the floor of\nCongress, and Congress decided they needed to help patients on dialysis and\nmade an exception so that disease could be covered by Medicare.\n\nSo if we can get patients a kidney transplant, not only can they live a much\nbetter quality of life, which is what Greg and I care about, we can also save\nthe taxpayer up to $1.5 million per patient in foregone dialysis. It's really\nrare in healthcare that patient and taxpayer interests are so closely aligned.\n\n####\n\nOn paper, the Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA) and the Centers\nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) were responsible for oversight for\nmore than a generation, right? How did the OPO executives get away with Napa\nValley field trips during this time?\n\nJE: I think there were a few things. One is, you actually have two different\ntypes of contractors. The national contractor, OPTN, was supposed to be\noverseen by HRSA, which is one agency of HHS. The dozens of local OPOs are\nsupposed to be overseen by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). So\nyou already had this division of oversight, and both agencies would say, \u201cWe\nhave this government contractor \u2014 UNOS \u2014 that is supposed to be looking out\nover the whole system.\u201d\n\nHere I'll quote Senator Chuck Grassley, who\u2019s been investigating this since\n2005. He said, \u201cAsking one contractor to look out for dozens of others is like\nasking the fox to guard the chicken house.\u201d It's fundamentally a failed model.\nIt has left patients in a terrible and deadly position. The Lives are at Stake\nreport details a continuous erosion of leverage from the government through\nthe contracting cycles.\n\nFor example, the report says that UNOS threatened to walk away and operate the\nU.S. transplant system outside the contract, which would be incredibly bad\nfaith behavior. Government isn't a monolith, but I think some people in\ngovernment perhaps thought they didn\u2019t have alternatives. Keep in mind that\nOPOs are on four-year contracting cycles, and UNOS, the OPTN, has been on\nfive-year contracting cycles. So all these contractors have had to do is\nwithstand scrutiny during a contracting period, and then they're in for four\nor five more years.\n\nA Forbes piece in 1999 called UNOS a \u201ccartel\u201d, and \u201cthe federal monopoly\nthat's chilling the supply of transplantable organs and letting Americans who\nneed them die needlessly.\u201d Donna Shalala, who was the Secretary of HHS under\nPresident Bill Clinton, called out UNOS misinformation in a Congressional\nhearing back in 1998 and called for competition in the field. The then-leader\nof HRSA called for an end to the stranglehold of the UNOS monopoly, and yet 25\nyears later, UNOS is still the monopoly contractor in charge. I think people\nof goodwill tried to introduce reform, but UNOS still managed to keep the\ncontract.\n\n####\n\nWas there any useful pressure from doctors or from hospitals on this issue?\nI'm imagining that if you're a surgeon waiting for a transplant, you don't\nlike that the OPOs are leaving it by the front door on a hot day.\n\nJE: There have been some tremendous surgeons who have spoken up, and three\nhave testified before three different congressional hearings in recent years,\nsaying that too many of their patients are dying, and the system has to be\nfixed. There's also been investigative reporting about UNOS threatening\nwhistleblowers. I'm grateful for voices for reform and I just want to\nacknowledge that this is why the government has to act.\n\n####\n\nYou mentioned that HHS Secretary Donna Shalala called for competition and an\nend to the stranglehold UNOS had on the system. Help me understand, didn't\nHRSA have some authority here, rather than simply saying there should be\ncompetition? Was that authority used?\n\nJE: It did, but there were two problems. One, when it came to contracting,\nthere was often a strict interpretation of that phrase in NOTA, which kept\nconstraining competition.\n\nI would also say that there are other oversight responsibilities that both\nHRSA and CMS should use and never have. The technology of UNOS is deeply\nfailing and antiquated \u2014 for hours at a time, it will shut down and no organs\nacross the country can be matched.\n\nOrgans are all on a clock, right? There's only so much cold ischemic time, or\ntime outside the body, they can have. An astounding one out of every four\nkidneys that's recovered from a generous American organ donor is thrown in the\ntrash. The federal government has never held UNOS or any OPOs accountable for\nthat.\n\nUntil recent data-driven regulation passed, CMS could not pull a contract from\na failing OPO. They tried to decertify the Arkansas OPO in 1999, but\nultimately lost in court because the regulation was written so badly, yet CMS\ndidn't update it for 21 years until 2020. That update, which passed under both\nPresident Trump and President Biden, was the first big win for patient\nadvocates. OPOs will be held accountable for their performance this year.\nBetween that and the Securing the U.S. OTPN Act that removed the restrictive\nphrase that propped up the national organ monopoly, we\u2019re hoping that 2024 is\na different year.\n\nGS: If you'll indulge me, I\u2019ll add one other quick piece of context from 1999,\nnot just as a history lesson, but because it is fiercely relevant now.\n\n####\n\nWe like history lessons too.\n\nGS: It\u2019s one thing for HRSA to say that we need more competition back in 1999,\nbut government contracting doesn\u2019t let them just pick whoever they want and\nbet on them. HRSA can only respond to credible bids that meet contracting\nrequirements. The Forbes report mentioned that UNOS was interfering with other\ncompetitors\u2019 bids, but even if everyone knew that, HRSA\u2019s hands would still\nhave been tied.\n\n####\n\nThe March 2023 Senate Finance Committee investigation dug up a bunch of dirt,\nincluding emails in which executives joked that their patient safety review\nboard was like putting your kids\u2019 artwork up at home: \u201cyou value it because of\nhow it was created rather than whether it's well done.\u201d\n\n####\n\nTalk to me about how you worked with Senate offices.\n\nJE: I mentioned how Greg brought this issue to the White House when I was in\nthe Obama administration. After the transition in January 2017, we brought it\nto Alex Azar, who was the Secretary of HHS. [Statecraft interviewed Secretary\nAzar on \u201cHow to Replicate Operation Warp Speed.\u201d] Greg, Secretary Azar, and I\nall lost relatives to organ failure, so we were all connected in this rather\nunfortunate way. We said, \u201cWe want to show you everything we started, every\nplace that we failed and where there's still work to do. This is not a\npolitical issue.\u201d\n\nThis is a rare bipartisan issue that's crossed multiple administrations. We\nhad similar conversations with Congress members and their staffs, and as I\nsaid, Senator Chuck Grassley has done hero\u2019s work highlighting problems at\nOPOs over the years. We also worked with then-ranking member Ron Wyden, who is\nnow chair of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Ben Cardin, and Senator\nTodd Young, who actually reached out to Greg over a cold email when Young was\nstill a member of the House. The four of them have really been tremendous\nleaders in this work.\n\nSo we went to see members of the Senate Finance Committee and also talked to\nmembers of the House Oversight Committee, which had a bipartisan hearing back\nin 2021. We tried to bring the data and the experts to show them what was\ngoing on. The Senate Finance investigation is now four years old, literally\nlonger than Watergate, and has driven many reforms. And I think it's important\nto realize that Congress can still work. I really want to give credit to not\nonly those four senators, but also Senators Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker,\nJerry Moran, Bill Cassidy, and on the House side, Congresswoman Katie Porter,\nand the current leader of the House Oversight Committee, James Comer. There\nare a lot of unlikely bedfellows here.\n\nGS: The Senate Finance Committee investigation launched publicly in February\n2020, but Senator Todd Young first contacted me in 2014, when he was still a\ncongressman. He was elected to the Senate in 2016, and eventually in 2018, he\nmoved over to the Senate Finance Committee, where Chuck Grassley was Chair at\nthe time and had been investigating UNOS on and off since 2005.\n\n####\n\nI think when most observers think of Senate committee investigations, they\nimagine scoring social media points off of a TikTok executive or one the more\nhigh profile politicized investigations recently. What makes for a good\ncommittee investigation? What makes committee oversight work?\n\nJE: I think out of the gate, it helps to have bipartisanship and finding\npoints of commonality. You need to be able to convince the two political\nparties that this makes sense to move on and ground things in data.\n\nI just want to give a tremendous amount of credit to members and their staff,\nwho really stayed focused on patients at every turn. They subpoenaed UNOS when\nit was stonewalling the investigation, and staffers pored over patient safety\ndocuments to highlight exactly what happened and who to hold accountable. It\nwas painstaking work.\n\nThere\u2019s been a ton of resistance from some of the contractors themselves, but\nI also want to call out the good actors. There have been OPO leaders who have\ncalled for reform, who said that their jobs matter and that they and their\ncolleagues should be held to a high standard. Some of them have testified\nbefore both the House and the Senate.\n\nGS: There have now been two Senate Finance Committee hearings. The hearings\nare vehicles to achieve a goal, and the Senate Finance Committee was so\nstrategic and thoughtful about the fact that there were a hundred problems\nwith the system. We fixed a few, but there are still ninety-something left.\n\nThe first hearing was in August of 2022, and a potential contracting cycle for\nOTPN was coming up. That hearing successfully showed that the status quo is\nunsafe and untenable, and by March of 2023, HRSA announced the intent to break\nup the OPTN monopoly in the OPTN Modernization Initiative. Then in the July\n2023 Senate Finance Committee hearing, Senators advocated for the passage of\nlegislation to amend NOTA to support the breakup of the monopoly contract.\nSeven days later, the legislation passed. So to your point about scoring\npoints on a TikTok executive, if there isn't a clear policy goal, what's going\nto fill that vacuum is a partisan goal or someone's need to go viral for\nreelection.\n\n####\n\nSo HRSA's modernization initiative happened before the bipartisan bill passed?\n\nJE: Yeah. The Senate Finance investigation is ongoing, but it launched in\nFebruary 2020. They issued a damning report of system failures that called for\nthe breakup of the monopoly in August of 2022. The modernization initiative\nthen followed about nine months later, saying that they needed help from\nCongress to amend the National Organ Transplant Act. That bill actually\noriginally came out of the Energy and Commerce Committee in the House, which\nis the Committee of Jurisdiction. Both the House and Senate passed the bill\nunanimously last July.\n\n####\n\nI feel like that back and forth relationship isn\u2019t always obvious unless\nyou\u2019re plugged into the story of organ transplant oversight. A Senate\ncommittee hearing can basically push an HHS agency to act, even without a\nformal requirement that HRSA changes its behavior.\n\nJE: And this was not only Senate Finance, but also, huge credit to Senator\nCory Booker and then-Congressman Mondaire Jones, who led a bicameral letter in\nNovember of 2022 that underscored the importance of the committee\nrecommendations and called to break up the national monopoly and that CMS\nenforce the OPO rule as an urgent health equity issue.\n\nWe're now four years on from the investigation and just last week HRSA issued\nthe first draft competitive Requests for Proposal (RFPs) for pieces of the\nOPTN contract. In our minds, nothing is actually going to be done until the\nmonopoly is broken up, and there are new, competent contractors working in\ntransparent contracting cycles that the government is holding accountable.\n\nThe rule that lets CMS hold OPOs accountable based on objective data passed in\n2020, but none of them have lost a contractor contract yet because of the\nsheer amount of time it takes to put those rules through and get through\ncontracting cycles. The OPO rule went through a midnight regulatory review\nprocess in 2021, was passed again by the Biden administration, and then we had\nto wait for the next contracting cycle.\n\nThis year the federal government will collect data, but that data won\u2019t be\navailable until 2026, when failing OPOs will be replaced by higher performers.\nThat regulation alone is projected to save 7,000 lives a year and one billion\ndollars annually to Medicare. So when will we think that the system is working\nfor patients? When every part of the country is served by a high-performing\nOPO. That's not an abstract vision, you can look at performance metrics from\nthe government.\n\n####\n\nUNOS claims not to oppose the law change; they\u2019re \u201cexcited to prove [their]\nvalue in a new competitive contracting environment.\u201d Is that an accurate\nrepresentation of their engagement with the legislative process?\n\nJE: I would go back to what Senator Chuck Grassley talked about, the fox\nguarding the chicken house. In the fight for the OPO rule, we saw that UNOS\nleaders were surrogates for the status quo on unenforceable OPO metrics and\ntried to block accountability. In similar fashion, the Association of OPOs\nlobbied against different provisions in the bill, trying to restrict\ncompetition.\n\nGS: I think that there was a lot of laundering of that opposition through\nother groups, whether through an astroturf lobbying group or misinforming\nwell-meaning patients who thought they were advocating for themselves but were\ndoing it based on completely uninformed, misleading, or objectively incorrect\ninputs. In the last few years, lobbyists have said \u201cWe support the goals of\nincreasing transplant, but we have edits,\u201d but then their edits just oppose\neverything.\n\n####\n\nKevin O'Connor, the chief executive of a Seattle-based OPO, said\ntransportation problems are \u201cminimal\u201c compared to the other reasons organs are\ndiscarded each year. He mentions biopsy findings, the inability to find a\nrecipient, and poor organ function. What do you make of that?\n\nJE: There can be valid reasons to discard organs, but the United States is the\nonly country that is throwing away one out of every four kidneys. I don't\nthink anyone would be impressed by the \u201cLook how many kidneys we didn't lose\u201d\nargument much as they wouldn't want to hear a pilot say, \u201cLook how many\nflights I didn't crash.\u201d This is a system that has to operate at a high level\nevery day, and we know how to do these logistics. Yet in 2024, we have a\nsystem where the technology goes down for hours at a time. The wifi at my\nhouse doesn't go down for hours at a time. And if it did, it would have no\nreal consequence. That we have life and death systems that have such abject\nfailures should be alarming.\n\nIn some instances, the system does work. Greg's dad got a heart transplant,\nbut I do not think that it should have been a five year wait. We put patients\nand their families through way too much unnecessary pain, and the organ\nwaiting list is an awful place to be. There are OPOs that do their job at a\nreally high level, and I want every family and patient to receive that\nservice.\n\nGS: To respond to that Kevin O'Connor quote, he is right that there are many\nreasons that organs are discarded. Jennifer is also right that the U.S. is an\noutlier. It isn\u2019t necessarily true that one thing went wrong 100 times. It\ncould be true that 20 things went wrong and they each went wrong five times,\nbut the U.S. is the only country in which that happens. That still means that\nUNOS is failing to identify and remediate problems in the system.\n\nYes, to Kevin\u2019s point, transportation is a problem, but there are also ten\nother problems. I think that should only increase the urgency. Perversely,\nsometimes it just increases the feelings of fatalism in government.\n\n####\n\nAre surgeon incentives an issue here? If you're a surgeon with a really high\nrate of successful transplants, you may not want to use a B+ kidney, you may\nwant to wait for a better organ and contribute to discard rates.\n\nGS: That is also a contributing problem, but let me give some context on how\nhaving an antiquated technology system exacerbates the problem. Remember,\nevery organ is on a clock, and only good for so long. If I\u2019m a surgeon, my\npatient is first on the list, and I'm offered the organ but for regulatory or\nperverse incentive, I don't want to take it for my patient, it goes to the\nnext patient on the list. This becomes problematic because the technology is\ndecades old. Seventeen percent of kidneys are offered to at least one deceased\nperson before they are transplanted, because the system doesn\u2019t do appropriate\ndata hygiene to pull deceased patients off of the list.\n\nAre there also things that can be addressed for transplant centers?\nAbsolutely. UNOS could make their technology nimble so that it's easy to go\ndown the list, whether the surgeons are passing the kidney for a good or bad\nreason. They could identify policy problems, OPO behavior, or surgeon\nbehavior, and go to regulatory bodies like CMS to demand they fix it. UNOS\nhasn\u2019t done that. If you really press them into a corner, they\u2019ll sometimes\nexplain that there are lots of problems, but they have no track record of\nlooking for solutions.\n\n####\n\nIs there anything else I should have asked?\n\nJE: What I hope comes across is that this has been an effort across multiple\nadministrations, with both political parties and two branches of government\nworking to fix the system. It\u2019s still not done, so we have to keep going. To\nwin a policy fight, you have to win the same argument multiple times, and it\u2019s\nimportant to stay vigilant beyond the regulation or law or front page story,\nuntil implementation actually affects people's lives.\n\nAn interview like this, in your inbox every week.\n\n21 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n4 Restacks\n\n21\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How to Stop Losing 17,500 Kidneys\n\nwww.statecraft.pub\n\n2\n\nShare\n\n2 Comments\n\nPeter McLaughlinHer Fingers Bloomed8 hrs agoThis is an amazing story. Some of\nthis I knew, some of it I didn\u2019t; much of the latter related to just how\ndysfunctional the US healthcare system is.I\u2019m surprised, though, by this\npassage:\"That OPO is supposed to turn up to every potential case in a timely\nand compassionate way and have one of two conversations with the family...\nKeep in mind that 95% of Americans support organ donation. My older brother is\na registered organ donor, and if, God forbid, something happened to him, and\nsomeone approached me at the hospital in a timely and compassionate way, I\nwould consent to organ donation. If they do not approach me, then I cannot\nconsent.\"The implication seems to suggest that, if only an OPO spoke to them\ncompassionately, a huge proportion of families would consent to the removal of\ntheir loved one\u2019s organs.But European experience, even in countries with\nreally great infrastructure for having those conversations, is that a not-\ninsignificant proportion of families refuse consent for donation when\napproached. I\u2019ve heard numbers in the 30%-50% range for family refusal in the\nUK, the country I know the most about. I had vaguely thought rates were\nsimilar in the US, but I'm aware I've never poked at the definition of \"family\nconsent withheld\" etc. in US stats, so maybe those numbers include cases where\nthe conversation never happens.This is, however, a small quibble with an\notherwise very good post. (Certainly, no matter whether families might not\nconsent if the conversation takes place, they cannot consent if it\ndoesn\u2019t!)Expand full commentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nStephany CarvalhoApr 10This is a problem that never even entered my mind, we\nthink something so important like this couldn't have that much negligence, but\nI guess we shouldn't be surprised.Expand full commentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nHow to Run a CIA Base in Afghanistan\n\n\"I spent a lot of time breaking the laws in other countries\"\n\nMar 13 \u2022\n\nSanti Ruiz\n\n74\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How to Run a CIA Base in Afghanistan\n\nwww.statecraft.pub\n\n7\n\nHow to Save Twenty Million Lives\n\n\"We might have given the White House more confidence than was valid\"\n\nAug 30, 2023 \u2022\n\nSanti Ruiz\n\n42\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How to Save Twenty Million Lives\n\nwww.statecraft.pub\n\n9\n\nHow to Recruit Iraqi Weapons Scientists\n\n\u201cBuilding civilian science was a more powerful tool than putting people in\nprison or killing them.\u201d\n\nMar 21 \u2022\n\nSanti Ruiz\n\n28\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How to Recruit Iraqi Weapons Scientists\n\nwww.statecraft.pub\n\n1\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Santi Ruiz\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
