Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA), Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA)\n\nOn Sunday, April 7, a draft of a bill titled the American Privacy Rights Act\n(APRA) was released by two lawmakers from Washington state, Senator Maria\nCantwell (D-WA) and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA). \u201cThis bipartisan,\nbicameral draft legislation is the best opportunity we\u2019ve had in decades to\nestablish a national data privacy and security standard that gives people the\nright to control their personal information,\u201d said Rep. Rodgers, who chairs\nthe House Energy & Commerce Committee, and Sen. Cantwell, who chairs the\nSenate Commerce Committee, in a joint statement.\n\nThe collaboration between the two lawmakers is notable in part because Sen.\nCantwell was one forceful opponent of a previous attempt at comprehensive\nprivacy legislation that Rep. McMorris Rodgers championed. Previously, Rep.\nMcMorris Rodgers steered the American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA)\nthrough the House Energy & Commerce Committee she chairs, advancing it out of\nthe committee by a 53-2 vote. But the bill stalled in the House as California\nDemocrats raised concerns about whether it would preempt that state\u2019s privacy\nlaw. Sen. Cantwell opposed it at the time, arguing the legislation\u2019s\nenforcement measures were weak.\n\nRELATED READING:\n\n  * The American Privacy Rights Act of 2024 Explained: What Does the Proposed Legislation Say, and What Will it Do?\n  * Can the American Privacy Rights Act Accomplish Data Minimization?\n  * Unclear Protections in the American Privacy Rights Act Not Worth Broad Preemption\n\nTech Policy Press invited a variety of experts and organizations to share\ntheir early analysis of the APRA.

As we review the APRA and give input as it moves\nforward in Congress, we will be focusing specifically on the strength of the\ndata minimization rules and the ability to enforce those rules under the bill.\nAs we said in 2022, getting strong privacy protections for all Americans is a\ntop priority, but the landscape has shifted significantly since 2022 and\nCongress needs to meet the moment if it is going to set a federal standard.\n\nAmericans are demanding real protections for their data and states have passed\nstrong privacy laws. But shifting away from a commercial surveillance infested\ninternet ecosystem is a major undertaking. Experience shows that this requires\nclear rules and guidance, coordination across jurisdictions, and a robust\nenforcement capacity. The APRA\u2019s substantive and enforcement provisions should\nbe read with these issues in mind.\n\nSo, how does enforcement look under APRA? The bill has a three-tiered\nenforcement structure similar to what we saw in the ADPPA (the FTC, states,\nand privacy actions), but there have been some significant changes as well.\nData minimization rules can\u2019t be enforced through the private right of action;\nthe California Privacy Protection Agency\u2019s work could be significantly\ndisrupted by preemption; and the new FTC privacy bureau would need substantial\nfunding and stronger enforcement tools. There is a lot to analyze, and we look\nforward to working with Congress to ensure strong, comprehensive privacy\nprotections for all Americans.\n\n## APRA\u2019s advertising definitions need work\n\n### Nathalie Mar\u00e9chal, PhD, Co-Director, Privacy & Data Project, Center for\nDemocracy & Technology\n\nIf APRA becomes law, one industry that will be profoundly transformed is\ndigital advertising, which relies heavily on data collected from around the\ninternet (and beyond) for both targeting (matching ad content to people) and\nmeasurement (assessing the effectiveness of campaigns). This could be a good\nthing: as I\u2019ve written repeatedly over the years, today\u2019s online ad ecosystem\nleaves its most important stakeholders\u2014people, publishers, and advertisers\nthemselves\u2014dissatisfied, while enriching ad-tech intermediaries and major tech\nplatforms in an increasingly concentrated market. Comprehensive federal\nprivacy legislation is an important opportunity to reinvent digital\nadvertising in a way that respects privacy and other rights and bolsters\ndemocracy, while supporting legitimate commerce and content creation.\n\nAs always, the devil is in the details, and many of APRA\u2019s ad-tech related\ndefinitions are either inadequate or altogether missing. Take contextual\nadvertising, for example: it lacks a definition and instead is relegated to a\nbrief description in the exclusions list in the definition for targeted\nadvertising. That definition also excludes first-party advertising (\u201cbased on\nan individual\u2019s visit to or use of a website or online service that offers a\nproduct or service that is related to the subject of the advertisement\u201d). APRA\nseems to use \u201ctargeted advertising\u201d to mean only \u201cthird-party behavioral\nadvertising,\u201d which is incomplete: ads can also be targeted based on first-\nparty behavioral data, context, characteristics, interests, or something else.\nIt makes sense to treat ads differently based on how they are matched with\naudiences, but that requires more detailed definitions.\n\nAside from my issues about the word \u201ctargeting,\u201d a more serious problem is\nthat APRA\u2019s description of contextual advertising (\u201cwhen an advertisement is\ndisplayed online based on the content of the webpage or online service on\nwhich the advertisement appears\u201d) fails to address crucial questions that will\ndetermine its future economic viability. What degree of geographic targeting\nshould be permitted, if any, and how should a user\u2019s location be determined at\nthe technical level? How does the concept of \u201ccontext,\u201d seemingly defined with\nstatic web pages in mind, translate to podcasting, streaming video, or social\nnetworking sites that have \u201cfeeds\u201d that change for different people and at\ndifferent times? These are answerable questions, fortunately. Stay tuned for\nanalysis and recommendations from CDT.\n\n## The APRA\u2019s approach to data minimization\n\n### Jordan Francis, Policy Counsel, Future of Privacy Forum\n\nThe American Privacy Rights Act\u2019s (APRA) novel approach to data minimization\nreflects an emerging perspective shift in US privacy law\u2014increasingly,\npolicymakers are experimenting with placing default limits on how personal\ninformation can be collected, used, and shared instead of requiring\nindividuals to exercise privacy rights on a burdensome case-by-case basis.\nUnder the APRA discussion draft, both covered entities and service providers\n(a notable change from many existing frameworks) would be barred from\ncollecting, processing, retaining, or transferring covered data \u201cbeyond what\nis necessary, proportionate, and limited to provide or maintain . . . a\nspecific product or service requested by the individual,\u201d or to effect a\nspecifically enumerated \u201cpermitted purpose,\u201d such as protecting data security.\nAPRA would also create affirmative express consent requirements for\ntransferring sensitive covered data to third parties and for collecting,\nprocessing, retaining, or transferring biometric and genetic information.\n\nAPRA\u2019s data minimization requirements diverge from the approaches taken under\nstate comprehensive privacy laws as well as the federal bill on which the\ndiscussion draft is based. APRA\u2019s predecessor from 2022, the ADPPA, was\nnotable in part due to its novel two-tier framework for data minimization.\nUnder the ADPPA, covered entities would have been permitted to collect,\nprocess, and transfer covered data only where doing so was \u201climited to what is\nreasonably necessary and proportionate\u201d to \u201cprovide or maintain a specific\nproduct or service requested by\u201d an individual or to effect an enumerated\n\u201cpermissible purpose.\u201d For sensitive data, ADPPA would have limited collection\nand processing to what is \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d to provide or maintain a\nproduct or service and prohibited transfers to third parties without\naffirmative consent. ADPPA\u2019s framework for data minimization has become\ninfluential in the states and is reflected in privacy legislation under\nconsideration in Maine, Vermont, and Michigan, as well as the recently passed\nMaryland Online Data Privacy Act, a bill whose supporters are calling one of\nthe strongest comprehensive privacy laws in the nation. The APRA discussion\ndraft largely preserves the ADPPA\u2019s data minimization standard, but it\nincludes key distinctions that would make the proposal both more and less\nrestrictive in different ways, such as rolling back ADPPA\u2019s \u201cstrictly\nnecessary\u201d standard for sensitive data processing in favor of consent\nrequirements.\n\nThe APRA discussion draft\u2019s data minimization standard also leaves some\nambiguity as to the bounds of what data practices are permissible and under\nwhat circumstances. For example, the APRA discussion draft is unclear on if\nthe consent requirements for sensitive data apply in addition to or in place\nof the general data minimization rule for covered data. In particular, data\ncollected from browsing activity across websites commonly used for targeted\nadvertising appears to be simultaneously subject to opt-in rights (with\nrespect to sensitive covered data transfers in Section 3), opt-out rights\n(with respect to targeted advertising in Section 6), and default prohibitions\non use (with respect to permitted purposes in Section 3), making the\nproposal\u2019s potential impact on the online advertising ecosystem unclear.\nFurthermore, a strict reading of the proposed minimization requirements of the\nAPRA discussion draft could curtail certain socially beneficial practices,\nsuch as processing for research carried out in the public interest.\n\nWhile APRA could represent a major step forward for the protection of personal\ndata under US privacy law, lawmakers will likely need to further clarify and\nrefine the framework's novel privacy rights and duties as it advances,\nparticularly with respect to data minimization, permissible purposes, and\nsensitive data.\n\n## The realities of compromise\n\n### David Morar, PhD, Senior Policy Analyst, Open Technology Institute\n\nIt would be an understatement to say I\u2019m excited about credibly discussing the\npotential passage of federal comprehensive privacy legislation\u2014again. For\ncontext, I\u2019ve argued for passing ADPPA at every single public event at which\nI\u2019ve spoken since the summer of 2022. Given the need to ensure bipartisan\nsupport, the discussion draft of the APRA\u2014much like the ADPPA\u2014is less a\nreflection of a comprehensive regulatory regime and more one of a negotiated\ncompromise, and we need to get comfortable with that reality, even while we\npush for a different result of said compromise.\n\nMy perpetual optimism about eventually getting a bill like this passed is\nusually tempered by the understanding that we likely won\u2019t get too many\nchances like this, and we should not waste a second one. What is clear is that\nwhile the bill name and text may be new, we are not having a new conversation\nabout federal legislation: the APRA is rooted in some of the same concepts as\nthe ADPPA and reflects, among other things, an interim compromise on\nprinciples for which civil society has long advocated.\n\nThe key word in understanding the APRA is \u201cinterim,\u201d since we are dealing with\nthe discussion draft. The current form of the APRA has loosely different\nanswers to the same legislative questions that were addressed by the ADPPA,\nbut it does not mean it will stay that way. The APRA is a credible compromise\nproposal that deserves urgent engagement. We need to ensure that it can pass\nwith thoughtful modifications that ensure the bill is as effective as\npossible, especially for communities and individuals most disproportionately\naffected by privacy violations. Let\u2019s roll up our sleeves and get to work.\n\n## The scope of state preemption is too broad\n\n### Emily Peterson-Cassin, Director, Corporate Power, Demand Progress\n\nThe scope of preemption here is broad, and that is a significant drawback.\nSince the last major Congressional privacy push two years ago, states have\nshown that they can and will legislate in this area to protect their\nresidents. And, states can act quickly in response to changing technology in a\nway that Congress simply cannot. This bill sets a ceiling on how much\nprotection states can offer their residents, when it should be setting a\nfloor.\n\nIt's great that Congress is taking a look at this, but advocates shouldn't\nrush to settle for something inferior just because it is so long overdue. We\nneed to consider whether these protections are truly what we need at this\nmoment, and whether they are strong enough and flexible enough to continue to\nprotect us until Congress chooses to act again. At this moment, the answer is\nno.\n\n## Do not remove the FCC\u2019s authority over communications services\n\n### Sara Collins, Director of Government Affairs, Public Knowledge\n\nThe death of a comprehensive privacy law has been greatly exaggerated. While\nthe American Data Privacy Protection Act (ADPPA) may be no more, the American\nPrivacy Rights Act (APRA) lives as its successor. As all of us are reviewing\nthis bill in light of two more years of state privacy laws passing, new\ntechnology coming into play, and deep concerns about how kids use the internet\n\u2013 at Public Knowledge, we are also concerned about something that seems to\nhave fallen under the radar of most other civil society organizations.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission has authority over communications\nnetworks, and the agency is about to restore its authority over broadband, as\nwell; unfortunately, the APRA appears to preempt the entirety of the\nCommunications Act. This overbroad preemption will have sweeping effects,\njeopardizing the reliability of our communications networks, competition in\nvoice, and important consumer protection goals like net neutrality,\ntransparency in billing, and anti-discrimination provisions.\n\nTo name just a few, the APRA would preempt the recently passed Safe\nConnections Act (protecting survivors of domestic abuse); the TRACED Act\n(mandating caller ID verification and authorizing action against robocallers);\nthe Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA); and every other\nprovision potentially relating to the regulation of phone numbers, call\nrouting, and cybersecurity. It would even prevent the FCC from readopting net\nneutrality rules that prohibit blocking or degrading applications. All of\nthese rules involve the \u201ccollection, processing, retention, transfer, or\nsecurity of covered data.\u201d Indeed, the preemption language is so broad its\nfull scope is difficult to determine. While the ADPPA was not perfect, it had\na much narrower preemption of the FCC\u2019s authority.\n\nPublic Knowledge would prefer that the FCC not be preempted at all. It is an\nimportant regulator that has done significant work in protecting Americans\u2019\nprivacy. It should be treated like the regulators that enforce Gramm Leach\nBliley (i.e., Financial Privacy rules) and HIPAA (i.e., Health Privacy rules),\nand not be displaced by the APRA. At the very least, the APRA should narrow\nits preemption to cover only those parts of the Communications Act that\ndirectly deal with privacy, rather than preempt the Communications Act\nentirely. The unintended consequences of such preemption language would be\ndisastrous.\n\n## Too many exemptions and loopholes\n\n### Arielle Garcia, Director of Intelligence, Check My Ads\n\n### Sarah Kay Wiley, Director of Policy, Check My Ads\n\nIt is long past due for America to have comprehensive privacy legislation, and\nwe applaud Senator Cantwell and Representative McMorris Rodgers for bringing\nprivacy to the foreground during an election year.\n\nHowever, as the ad-tech watchdog, we are concerned with potential loopholes\nthat, if enacted, could allow the digital advertising industry to continue its\nunchecked trade in consumers\u2019 sensitive personal data and put more power into\nthe hands of dominant tech companies \u2014 harming individuals, advertisers, and\ndemocracy.\n\n1\\. Ad-tech companies and data brokers could exploit \u201cservice provider\u201d\nexemptions to undermine the privacy of people\u2019s web browsing data\n\nWhile APRA says it will require opt-in consent for sharing sensitive web\nbrowsing data with third parties, there is a big loophole that ad-tech\ncompanies are all too familiar with: consent isn\u2019t needed to share this data\nwith \u201cservice providers.\u201d We have already seen ad-tech companies and data\nbrokers attempt to position themselves as service providers to avoid adhering\nto consumer choice and opt-in requirements in the past. This loophole is\ntroubling and we hope to see it remedied to keep people\u2019s intimate online\nactivity data out of the hands of shady middlemen and dodgy data brokers.\n\n2\\. The \u201cdeidentified data\u201d loophole is the lifeblood of surveillance\nadvertising\n\nAd-tech companies have a nasty habit of playing fast-and-loose with what they\nconsider to be \u201cdeidentified\u201d data while openly bragging about their ability\nto target, track, and profile people at an individual level. The way that the\nad-tech industry uses unique identifiers - to track individuals\u2019 every move\nacross sites, apps, services, and devices over time for behavioral advertising\n- is incompatible with the concept of de-identification.\n\nFor example, a recent report by Open Rights Group and Cracked Labs explains\nhow one large ad-tech company, LiveRamp, assigns a specific \u201cRampID\u201d to each\nperson that is tied to their name, home address, device IDs, and the IDs held\nby other data brokers, social, and ad-tech platforms. This RampID is used to\nlet ad-tech companies and data brokers \u201crecognize, track, follow, profile and\ntarget people\u201d - but LiveRamp has called it \u201cpseudonymized,\u201d \u201cdeidentified,\u201d\nand even \u201canonymous.\u201d To rein in these deceptive practices and give consumers\nmeaningful choice over who gets to know and use their most intimate details,\nit must be clear that ad-tech companies can no longer use these word games to\ncircumvent consumers\u2019 opt-out rights.\n\n3\\. We can\u2019t let the Privacy-Enhancing Technologies pilot program be\nweaponized by big tech bullies\n\nWhile the Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (\u201dPET\u201d) pilot program seems positive,\nad-tech companies have established a track record of privacy-washing without\ntaking meaningful action to improve consumer privacy. Worse, big tech\ncompanies like Google, Apple, and Meta have been defining \u201cprivacy\u201d in\nalignment with their own commercial interests and weaponizing PETs and privacy\nrhetoric to bolster their dominance to the detriment of advertisers,\nconsumers, and publishers. For the PET pilot program to incentivize true\nprivacy enhancements, it is integral that adequate governance and resourcing\nare established to ensure truly independent auditing and insulate the program\nfrom being undermined by big tech lobbying and influence.\n\n## Advances Protections for Sensitive Data, But Gaps in Enforcement\n\n### Melinda Sebastian, PhD, Senior Policy Analyst, Data & Society\n\nThe American Privacy Rights Act of 2024 is very ambitious and similar in\nspirit to Europe's GDPR \u2014 but creates a much bigger umbrella of what is\nconsidered sensitive data. Because of that, if passed, the bill would\nrepresent the most comprehensive approach to privacy on the federal level, and\nit also includes a requirement for privacy impact assessments. These could be\na positive step towards accountability, achieved through standardized\nreporting on industry actions with consumer data. Yet policymakers must also\nconsider whether the current FTC has the capacity to execute the bill\u2019s many\ndirectives, including establishing a new bureau that is \"...comparable in\nstructure, size, organization, and authority to the existing bureaus within\nthe Commission related to consumer protection and competition.\"\n\nThere are gaps in how the bill describes enforcement capacity on the\ngovernment side, while offering more details on the industry capacity. The\nbill outlines that FTC is the major enforcing agency, with support from state\nattorneys general, and the bill also gives individuals the ability to sue with\na private right of action. Although the bill details a Victims' Relief Fund,\nand a GAO study to address hiring costs for state attorneys general, it does\nnot detail an increased budget or means of funding for an expanded FTC. While\nthe bill is very clear on mission, scope, and timeline, it is far less so when\nit comes to the practicalities of funding a new bureau. In conceiving of\ncapacity on the industry side of things, the bill\u2019s language about exemptions\nmakes clear that for smaller companies, including nonprofits, capacity would\nnot be an issue of budgetary concern. This is because the bill targets larger\ncompanies or \"covered entities\" who do have the capacity to execute the\ndirectives of this bill. This puts the majority of the burden to comply with a\ncomprehensive set of standards squarely on the industry side. There is\ncertainly capital and people power to make that happen, and that offers a\npromising potential for change.\n\nIt is evident that a great deal of effort went into creating a bill that\ncomprehensively protects consumers and seemingly also intends to uphold\nexisting \"real world\" civil rights protections in a digital space. What is\nless clear from the bill in its current form is where the funding to make this\npossible would come from. More detail on that (as the bill does provide on the\nVictims Relief Fund, for example) will be necessary to understand the\nspecifics of how these new positions would be funded.\n\n## Authors\n\nJustin Hendrix\n\nJustin Hendrix is CEO and Editor of Tech Policy Press, a new nonprofit media\nventure concerned with the intersection of technology and democracy.\nPreviously, he was Executive Director of NYC Media Lab.
