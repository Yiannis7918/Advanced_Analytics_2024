Less than a month\nlater another whale, a recent mother, was found floating off the coast of\nVirginia. Her back was broken from the blunt-force trauma of a ship collision;\nher calf, missing and still meant to be nursing, is not expected to live.\nThree deaths within weeks is not good news for the North Atlantic right\nwhales, of which only about 360 remain.\n\nThey are dying mainly because of human activity, and they are not alone. Ship\ncollisions threaten whale populations worldwide, killing up to 20,000\nindividuals annually. With global ocean traffic forecast to rise by at least\n240% by 2050, the problem will balloon. But a new movement is using technology\nto fight back. On April 11th a Californian strike-prevention programme\nexpanded operations across North American waters. Other countries are\nfollowing suit.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get the full story\n\n### Enjoy a month of insightful analysis for free.
