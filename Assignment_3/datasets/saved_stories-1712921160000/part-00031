Haulla did not provide a\ncomment prior to publication.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Haulla stole \u201cconfidential and proprietary customer\ninformation\u201d and used it to encourage Waste Connections customers to \u201cbreach\ntheir contracts and sign contracts with Haulla instead.\u201d The practice helped\nHaulla make money and transfer any potential contract liability onto new\ncustomers, the suit alleges.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Waste Connections employees began noticing\n\u201csuspicious and coordinated\u201d activity on its customer portal in 2023. That\nportal holds account details such as billing information, pricing terms,\nfrequency of pickup and other details.\n\nWaste Connections employees noticed duplicate or new account profiles for\nlong-established customers, or contact information that didn\u2019t match customer\nnames. Some of the fake profiles on the portal appeared to be used to download\nproprietary customer information before those profiles were deleted, it said.\n\nIn some cases, \u201cagents\u201d working for Haulla repeatedly guessed security\nquestions on real customers\u2019 profiles in order to gain access to the site. In\nothers, they called, emailed or used Waste Connections\u2019 customer chat to\nimpersonate customers to request account numbers or copies of invoices,\naccording to the lawsuit.\n\nWaste Connections added security measures to prevent more fraudulent activity\nand notified customers affected by the issue, which the company said hurt its\nreputation.\n\nThe lawsuit says the fraudulent activity helped bolster Haulla\u2019s business\nmodel, which is \u201cspecifically designed to disrupt relationships between\ncommercial customers and waste collection companies with which they contract.\u201d\n\nHaulla\u2019s website promotes itself as a cheaper alternative to established\ncompanies and says it has partnered with smaller waste haulers to help them\n\u201ccompete with big-name haulers who may have long established connections.\u201d\n\nHaulla has acted as a broker for several Texas-based haulers such as Rio\nGrande Waste and Frontier Waste Solutions, who are named in the lawsuit as\ncustomers of Haulla but not as plaintiffs or defendants. Those companies did\nnot immediately return calls seeking comment.\n\nHaulla does business in 19 states throughout the U.S., including in Texas,\nCalifornia, New York, Florida and Pennsylvania, according to its website.\nEcube, based in South Korea, was founded in 2011 and makes technology such as\nbin fill-level sensors. Haulla started in 2019.\n\nHaulla\u2019s website also promotes the service as a method for customers to get\nout of longer-term contracts with other companies. \u201cMany businesses are stuck\nin long-term contracts with haulers that are overcharging them. Haulla can\nhelp,\u201d the website said. The website offers \u201cassistance in dealing with all\nformalities related to the termination of the contract with the existing waste\nhaulage company.\u201d\n\nHaulla offers to pay liquidated damages owed by a customer who terminates an\nexisting contract, but the lawsuit alleges the company\u2019s actual contract\nstates it \u201cmay\u201d pay such damages and reserves the right to decline to do so or\nraise customer rates.\n\nThe lawsuit further alleges that Haulla actively recruits workers in the\nPhilippines to impersonate Waste Connections customers and call real customers\nto persuade them to switch to Haulla services. One customer mentioned in the\ncase was told she would save more than 20% on her service if she switched.\n\nIn another instance, Haulla allegedly impersonated El Paso Disposal by sending\nfake emails to customers to notify them that their accounts had been closed\ndue to a rejected payment.\n\nWaste Connections calls for an injunction to permanently prevent Haulla from\nstealing customers and accessing online portals. Haulla is expected to respond\nto the lawsuit in court in coming weeks.\n\nThis is not the first time that Waste Connections has sued a broker. In 2016\nand 2017, Waste Connections sued Rubicon for alleged competitive issues and\nthe two companies went back and forth over legal issues in multiple states.\n\n### Recommended Reading\n\n  * Waste Connections and Rubicon enter new legal battle over competitive practices By Cole Rosengren \u2022 Aug. 10, 2017\n\n  * post\n  * share\n  * tweet\n  * print\n  * email\n  * license\n\nFiled Under: Collections & Transfer\n\n### Waste Dive news delivered to your inbox\n\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n### Editors' picks\n\n  * ablokhin via Getty Images\n\n### Florida composters look to grow operations despite regulatory barriers\n\nAmid increased interest in organics recycling on multiple fronts, as well as\nnew municipal and academic partnerships, the Florida Composting Council and\nother groups say regulatory updates are needed to advance this work.\n\nBy Cole Rosengren \u2022 March 22, 2024\n\n  * Extreme-Photographer via Getty Images\n\nDeep Dive\n\n### 5 issues to watch as New York reshapes its commercial waste system\n\nMany questions remain about how companies were selected, how much recycling\ninvestment will occur, how soon companies get electric vehicles, when\nimplementation will begin and more.\n\nBy Cole Rosengren \u2022 Feb. 16, 2024\n\n### Get the free newsletter\n\nSubscribe to Waste Dive for top news, trends & analysis\n\n### Most Popular\n\n  1.
