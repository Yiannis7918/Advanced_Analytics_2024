Top entrepreneurs, engineers, scientists, VCs, angels,\ngovernment officials, cultural icons, and more are active on the platform and\nexcited to connect with aligned individuals.\n\n## Comparing Airchat and other Popular Social Networks\n\nHere's a breakdown of how Airchat compares to some of the most popular social\nnetworks:\n\n### Airchat vs. X (Twitter)\n\nPerhaps to state the obvious, Airchat requires users to express themselves\nthrough brief audio notes instead of text. But beyond the audio vs text\ndistinction, the platforms specialize in different kinds of communication.\n\nX is perfect for broadcasting official statements and updates, which can then\nbe cited by traditional media. It's great for making powerful statements that\nreach a wide audience. However, while X is decent for dialogue, Airchat is\nsuperior in this regard. This isn\u2019t a surprise, since Airchat is specifically\ndesigned to be great for meaningful two-way conversations.\n\n### Airchat vs. TikTok\n\nTikTok specializes in the creation and distribution of short form videos,\nespecially entertainment, educational, and opinion content. There\u2019s no better\nplatform today for spreading viral cultural memes to a mass audience than\nTikTok.\n\nAirchat\u2019s basic unit of media is a two or more person conversation. It\u2019s much\nless about broadcasting and traditional virality, and more akin to a platform\nthat facilitates dialogue that anyone can jump into.\n\nInstagram is more about friend-to-friend relationships than TikTok, but is\ndesigned for sharing photos/videos versus facilitating dialogue.\n\n### Airchat vs. LinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn is great for connecting with people in more traditional roles and\ncorporations. It has been widely adopted across countries, and you're likely\nto find most people representing traditional corporations on LinkedIn.\nHowever, there may be influential people on Airchat who don't use LinkedIn at\nall. I predict Airchat will be why so many deals are made between companies\nand individuals most on the bleeding edge of innovation.\n\n### Airchat vs. Clubhouse\n\nThe old Clubhouse was the inspiration for X Spaces, which is livestreamed\nsynchronous talks/broadcasts.\n\nThe new Clubhouse is a platform for creating \u201chuge group voice message\ngroups.\u201d It\u2019s not about discovering new creators / thought leaders anymore.\n\nAirchat is distinct from both the old and new Clubhouse. Airchat is most\nsimilar today to X, something like a town square, except where the default\nmedium of communication is a voice note instead of a typed out tweet.\n\nOne thing I love about Airchat is that Airchat conversations are asynchronous.\nCompare this to how the old Clubhouse forced people to be in a particular\nplace at a particular time. The asynchronous nature of Airchat empowers people\nto meet, connect, and coordinate without having to be present simultaneously,\nrespecting people's time and allowing them to connect at their own pace.\n\nIn summary, Airchat offers unique advantages compared to other social\nnetworks, particularly in terms of facilitating asynchronous dialogue and\nconnection. While other platforms have their strengths and will stay relevant\neven with the introduction of Airchat, Airchat fills a distinct niche in the\nsocial media landscape.\n\n## What You Should Know When You\u2019re Getting Started\n\nHere are 10 tips on how to effectively use the simple and powerful\nfunctionality of Airchat:\n\n### 1\\. Ask for a Welcome Chit:\n\nRequest the person who invited you to create an introduction chit. This way,\nyou'll have something to reply to rather than just posting into the void. It's\na reasonable ask for the person who invited you.\n\n### 2\\. Toggle Between Audio and Video\n\nWhile audio notes are the default for Airchat, you can switch between audio to\nvideo easily using the bottom toggle (you\u2019ll see \u2018Audio\u2019 and \u2018Video\u2019 buttons).\n\n### 3\\. Be Brief (or Create Threads)\n\nSince you need to hold the record button while speaking, you\u2019ll naturally be\nmore mindful about keeping your messages short. This is by design. Aim for no\nlonger than 20-second chits. You can thread chits like an X thread if you need\nto elaborate on a single point.\n\n### 4\\. Set a Descriptive Bio\n\nHelp others know who you are without having to stalk you on social media. Make\nyour bio informative and engaging if you want strangers to know whether it\nmakes sense to follow you. Here\u2019s mine from 2024-04-13:\n\n### 5\\. Converse More Than You Broadcast\n\nAirChat is more about conversation than broadcasting. Start discussions, and\nump right into chats that capture your interest. AirChat is like a scalable,\nopen-space house party. And don't worry about interrupting, as the beauty of\nthis technology is that the person can choose whether or not to reply to you.\n\n### 6\\. Change the Playback Speed\n\nYou can adjust the playback speed of messages by long-pressing the play\nbutton. After you long-press, you\u2019ll see the ability to toggle 1x 2x and 3x.\n\n### 7\\. Tag People You Want To Converse With\n\nIf you want to start a conversation with another Airchatter, after you create\na chit, click the \u2018+\u2019 icon and search their name and click their name. You can\ntag multiple people in a chit.\n\n### 8\\. Join Channels\n\nThere are topic channels like Bitcoin, Longevity, Astrology, War, and more\nwhich can help you find likeminded individuals who care about the same topics.\nChits in these channels are by default viewable by people outside the channel.\n\nSee \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with Airchat channels?\u201d in the Appendix to learn more.\n\n### 9\\. Invite Your Friends\n\nAirchat is more fun with friends. Have conversations with these friends that\nyou wouldn\u2019t mind other smart people jumping into. That\u2019s the beauty of\nAirchat. You step into serendipity when you use the platform\n\n### 10\\. Don't Overthink It\n\nImagine you're at a house party with people you trust and want to know better.\nIt might be anxiety-inducing, but that's part of the experience\u2014it's like a\ngiant house party. Just be yourself!\n\n## Three Powerful Use Cases for Airchat\n\nHere are three key use cases for AirChat that stand out to me:\n\n### 1\\. Exploring Truth Around Shared Interests\n\nAirchat is an ideal platform for curious individuals who want to explore truth\naround a specific topic. Whether you're interested in the best use cases for\ncrypto, wellness and longevity interventions, new patterns in filmmaking, or\neven the perfect creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e recipe, you'll find like-minded people excited\nto engage in dialogue on mutually interesting subjects. If you're looking for\nothers who share your passions, Airchat is a great place to find your\ncommunity.\n\n### 2\\. Finding Collaborators and Advancing Projects\n\nThink of Airchat as a giant, scalable house party or innovation conference.\nJust as people often find collaborators, seed investors, co-founders, and\nthought partners at such events, Airchat attracts a caliber of individuals who\ncan help advance your projects. By sharing information about yourself, your\nwork, and the opportunities you offer, you open the door to potential\ncollaborations. Don't hesitate to ask for help or extend invitations to\ncollaborate \u2013 you never know who might be out there, ready to contribute to\nyour endeavors.\n\n### 3\\. Staying Informed and Connected with Influential Thinkers\n\nAirchat provides a unique opportunity to stay informed about the thoughts and\nideas of people you admire. The platform's culture encourages sharing\nunfiltered, not overly polished streams of consciousness. This means you'll\nhave access to the genuine thoughts of influential individuals, from top\nTikTok stars and YouTube creators to Grammy winners and industry leaders like\nGarry Tan. By engaging with their content on Airchat, you can gain valuable\ninsights into the collective consciousness of future innovators and stay\nconnected with the minds shaping our world.\n\n## Appendix\n\n\u2023\n\n### Who should I follow?\n\nA diverse range of individuals from various fields are active on Airchat. For\nexample, if you're interested in startup ecosystems, people like Garry Tan are\ngreat follows. If you're into Bitcoin, people like Anthony Pompliano are worth\nfollowing. For those passionate about design, Dylan Field, the founder of\nFigma, is someone to consider.\n\nBut beyond going out of your way to search notable public figures, here are\nsome other tips related to curating your feed:\n\n  1. Take Advantage of the Home Feed Recommendations The home feed will showcase conversations from people you're not already following. This means you don't need to have a pre-existing network to start discovering interesting discussions. If you come across a conversation that piques your interest or resonates with you, click on the person's bio. If you'd like to continue following their future conversations without relying solely on the algorithm, simply click the follow button.\n  2. Utilize the Channels Feature Airchat is actively developing a feature called channels, which helps users find people interested in specific topics. Whether you're into longevity, Bitcoin, design, astrology, or any other subject, more and more channels will be rolled out to help you identify individuals who share your passions. Keep an eye out for these channels, as they will serve as a valuable tool for discovering new people to follow.\n  3. Connect with and Invite Friends Don't forget to follow your friends on Airchat, as many of them may already be using the app. You also have the ability to invite your friends. Connecting with people you know can help you build a strong foundation for your network and make the app experience more engaging and enjoyable.\n\nIn genreal, the key to finding the right people to follow on Airchat is to\nexplore, engage with conversations that interest you, and leverage features\nlike channels to discover individuals who align with your passions and\ncuriosities.\n\n\u2023\n\n### How should I introduce friends who I invite to Airchat?\n\nWhen inviting someone to Airchat, provide them with a thoughtful introduction\nto make them feel welcome and give them an immediate opportunity to engage.\nHere's a guide on what to include in your introduction:\n\n  1. Who is the person? Introduce the individual by sharing their name, background, and any relevant information that helps others understand who they are.\n  2. Why did you invite them? Explain your reasoning for inviting this person to AirChat. What makes them a valuable addition to the community?\n  3. What are they working on and/or why might they be fun to talk to? Share details about their current projects, interests, or endeavors that other members might find intriguing or relevant. You could also highlight the person's unique qualities, perspectives, or experiences that could lead to enjoyable and insightful conversations.\n\nBy crafting a comprehensive introduction, you not only provide a hook for the\nperson you're inviting to reply to but also give other members a reason to\nfollow them based on their work and conversation topics.\n\n\u2023\n\n### What\u2019s the deal with Airchat channels?\n\nAirchat channels are a feature designed to help users create focused, topical\nsub-communities within the app. This helps users engage with content and\ndiscussions that are more relevant to their interests (while still enabling\nthe most interesting content from these channels to be surfaced in the main\nfeed).\n\nCurrently, there are two types of channels:\n\n  1. Permissionless channels: Users can freely join and post in these channels without an invitation.\n  2. Invite-only channels: Users can only join and post in these channels if they receive an invitation.\n\nAs of April 13, 2024, the channel system is still in the testing phase, and\nonly the Airchat team has the ability to create channels and assign admins.\nHowever, I predict that in the next few weeks, the platform will introduce\napplication-based channels and allow users to create their own channels.\n\nI see the channel system as a really promising feature for Airchat, drawing\ninspiration from the success of similar systems on other social media\nplatforms like Farcaster.\n\nAdditionally, I expect the introduction of group DMs\u2014which will enhance the\nuser experience on Airchat of groups that want a little privacy.\n\nStay tuned for more updates on these exciting developments!\n\n\u2023\n\n### What\u2019s my relationship to Airchat?\n\nI've been a friend and supporter of the Airchat team since April 2023 when I\nparticipated in the Zuzalu Montenegro experiment, a two-month event in\nMontenegro. The Airchat team asked if I wanted to invite the future-focused\nbuilders at Zuzalu to try out their early-stage app. I loved the idea, so I\nonboarded numerous Zuzalians and more to the app, and it has been an ongoing\njourney of helping beta best the app ever since.\n\nAs someone who loves audio as a medium and believes in the team behind\nAirChat, I've witnessed the app's evolution from less user-friendly iterations\nto the version you see today. The team's hunger and understanding of the gap\nin the social media market for a deeply human, authentic, voice-first, and\nasynchronous platform are truly remarkable.\n\nFrom the very beginning, I recognized Airchat's potential to fill an important\ngap in human connection and help people rediscover their humanity and ability\nto engage in meaningful dialogue. Watching the Airchat team persist through\nlaunches that didn't gain significant traction, and then being willing to go\nback to the drawing board and develop an entirely new app with a completely\ndifferent UX, has been deeply inspiring to me.\n\nIt's been amazing to see this new app take off, and it's well-deserved. If\nyou're not on the app now and want to be immersed in a digital builder\nculture, I highly recommend joining Airchat very soon.\n\n\u2023\n\n### How do I download Airchat?\n\nApp Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/airchat-just-talk/id1469462351\n\nGoogle Play:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wooshinc.getairchat&pli=1\n\nAs of 2024-04-13, you need an invite from an existing user.\n\nGary Sheng's Wiki\n\nReturn to Gary's Personal Website\n\n", "frontpage": false}
