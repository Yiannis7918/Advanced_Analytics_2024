Guards admitted two men posing\nas police officers responding to a disturbance call, and the thieves bound the\nguards and looted the museum over the next hour. The case is unsolved; no\narrests have been made, and no works have been recovered. The stolen works\nhave been valued at hundreds of millions of dollars by the FBI and art\ndealers. The museum offers a $10 million reward for information leading to the\nart's recovery, the largest bounty ever offered by a private institution.\n\nThe stolen works were originally procured by art collector Isabella Stewart\nGardner (1840\u20131924) and were intended for permanent display at the museum with\nthe rest of her collection. Among them was The Concert, one of only 34 known\npaintings by Johannes Vermeer and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered\npainting in the world. Also missing is The Storm on the Sea of Galilee,\nRembrandt's only seascape. Other paintings and sketches by Rembrandt, Edgar\nDegas, \u00c9douard Manet and Govert Flinck were stolen, along with a relatively\nvalueless eagle finial and Chinese gu. Experts were puzzled by the choice of\nartwork, as more valuable works were left untouched. As the collection and its\nlayout are intended to be permanent, empty frames remain hanging both in\nhomage to the missing works and as placeholders for their return.\n\nThe FBI believes that the robbery was planned by a criminal organization. The\ncase lacks strong physical evidence, and the FBI has largely depended on\ninterrogations, undercover informants and sting operations to collect\ninformation. It has focused primarily on the Boston Mafia, which was in the\nmidst of an internal gang war during the period. One theory holds that\ngangster Bobby Donati organized the heist to negotiate for his caporegime's\nrelease from prison; Donati was murdered one year after the robbery. Other\naccounts suggest that the paintings were stolen by a gang in Boston's\nDorchester neighborhood, although these suspects deny involvement despite the\nfact that a sting operation resulted in several prison sentences. All have\ndenied any knowledge or have provided leads that proved fruitless, despite the\noffer of reward money and reduced or canceled prison sentences if they had\ndisclosed information leading to recovery of the artworks.\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nThe Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum was constructed under the guidance of art\ncollector Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840\u20131924) to house her personal art\ncollection.^[1] The museum opened to the public in 1903, and Gardner continued\nto expand the collection and arrange it until she died in 1924. She left the\nmuseum with a $3.6 million endowment,^[2] and her will stipulated that the\narrangement of the artwork should not be altered and that no items were to be\nsold from or purchased into the collection.^[1]\n\nBy the 1980s, the museum was running low on funds.^[3] This financial strain\nleft the museum in poor condition; it lacked a climate control system and an\ninsurance policy and was in need of basic building maintenance.^[4]^[5]^[3]\nAfter the FBI uncovered a plot by Boston criminals to rob the museum in 1982,\nthe museum allocated funds to improve security.^[6] Among these improvements\nwere 60 infrared motion detectors and a closed-circuit television system\nconsisting of four cameras placed around the building's perimeter.^[7]^[8]^[6]\nNo cameras had been installed inside the museum, as its board of trustees\nconsidered the cost prohibitive,^[4] but additional security guards were\nhired.^[6] Despite these security improvements, the only manner in which\nguards could summon police to the museum was by pressing a button at the\nsecurity desk. Other area museums had fail-safe systems that required night\nwatchmen to place hourly phone calls with the police to indicate that\nconditions were normal.^[8]\n\nAn independent consultant reviewed the museum's security operations in 1988\nand determined that they were on par with most other museums but recommended\nimprovements.^[6] The security director at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston\nalso suggested security upgrades to the museum.^[9] Because of the museum's\nfinancial strain and Gardner's directive forbidding major renovations, the\nboard of trustees did not approve these security enhancements.^[6]^[10]^[11]\nThe board also denied a request from the security director for higher guard\nsalaries in a bid to attract more qualified applicants. The museum's guards\nwere paid slightly higher than minimum wage,^[12] and the museum's security\nflaws were an open secret among the guards.^[13]\n\n## Robbery[edit]\n\nThe Gardner Museum in 2018\n\n### Prelude[edit]\n\nThe robbery occurred in the early hours of Sunday, March 18, 1990.^[14] The\nthieves were first witnessed around 12:30 a.m. by several St. Patrick's Day\nrevelers leaving a party near the museum.^[15]^[14] The two men were disguised\nas police officers and parked in a hatchback on Palace Road, about a hundred\nfeet from the side entrance.^[16]^[14] The witnesses believed them to be\npolicemen.^[14]\n\nThe museum guards on duty that night were Rick Abath, age 23, and Randy\nHestand, age 25. Abath was a regular night watchman, but March 18 was\nHestand's first time on the night shift.^[7] The museum's security policy\nrequired that one guard would patrol the galleries with a flashlight and\nwalkie-talkie while the other would sit at the security desk.^[7] When Abath\ntook the first patrol, fire alarms sounded in several rooms, but he could not\nlocate any fire or smoke.^[8]^[17] He returned to the security room where the\nfire alarm control panel indicated smoke in multiple rooms. He assumed that\nsome type of malfunction had occurred and disabled the panel before returning\nto his patrol.^[8]^[16] Before completing his rounds, Abath stopped at the\nside entrance of the museum, briefly opening the side door and shutting it\nagain without informing Hestand.^[16] Abath returned to the security desk\naround 1:00 a.m., and Hestand assumed patrol duties.^[16]\n\n### Guards are subdued[edit]\n\nAt 1:20 a.m., the thieves drove to the side entrance, parked and walked to the\nside door.^[15]^[17] They rang the buzzer, which connected them to Abath\nthrough an intercom. They explained to Abath that they were police\ninvestigating a disturbance and that they must be admitted.^[15] Abath could\nsee them on the closed-circuit television wearing what appeared to be police\nuniforms.^[15]^[18] He was not aware of any disturbance, but he surmised that\na St. Patrick's Day reveler may have had climbed over the fence, causing\nsomeone to report it to the police.^[19] Abath admitted the men at 1:24\na.m.^[18]^[20]\n\nThe thieves first entered a locked foyer that separated the side door from the\nmuseum.^[21] They approached Abath at the security desk and asked if anyone\nelse was in the museum. Abath radioed Hestand to return to the security\ndesk.^[21]^[18] Abath noticed around this time that the taller man's moustache\nappeared to be fake.^[21] The shorter man told Abath that he looked familiar\nand that they may have a warrant for his arrest, demanding that Abath emerge\nfrom behind the desk to provide identification.^[21] Abath complied, leaving\nthe desk that contained the museum's only panic button to alert\npolice.^[21]^[18] The shorter man forced Abath against a wall, spread his legs\nand handcuffed him.^[22] Hestand walked into the room around this time, and\nthe taller thief turned him toward the wall and handcuffed him.^[22] With both\nguards handcuffed, the thieves revealed their true intentions to rob the\nmuseum and asked the guards to not cause any problems.^[22]\n\nThe thieves wrapped duct tape around the heads and eyes of the guards. Without\nasking for directions, they led the guards into the basement, where the guards\nwere handcuffed to a steam pipe and workbench.^[22]^[23] The thieves examined\nthe guards' wallets and threatened that they knew where the guards lived and\ntold them that if they would not inform the authorities, they would receive a\nreward in about a year.^[22]^[23]^[24] It took the thieves less than 15\nminutes to subdue the guards, which they completed at about 1:35 a.m.^[25]\n\n### Stealing the works[edit]\n\nThe frame that once held Chez Tortoni\n\nThe thieves' movements through the museum were recorded on infrared motion\ndetectors.^[26] Steps in the first room they entered, the Dutch Room on the\nsecond floor, were not recorded until 1:48 a.m.^[25] This was 13 minutes after\nthey had finished subduing the guards, perhaps waiting to ensure that police\nhad not been alerted.^[25]\n\nAs the thieves approached the paintings in the Dutch Room, a sensor sounded\nthat was intended to alert when patrons moved too close to artwork, and the\nthieves smashed the device.^[27]^[23] They removed The Storm on the Sea of\nGalilee and A Lady and Gentleman in Black from the wall and threw them on the\nmarble floor, shattering their glass frames. Using a blade, they cut the\ncanvases out of their stretchers.^[27]^[28]^[29] They also removed a large\nRembrandt self-portrait oil painting from the wall but left it leaning against\na cabinet.^[30]^[29] Investigators believe that the thieves may have\nconsidered it too large to transport, potentially because it was painted on\nwood and not canvas like the others.^[31]^[30] The thieves instead took a\nsmall postage-stamp-sized self-portrait etching by Rembrandt on display\nbeneath the larger portrait.^[32]^[29] On the right side of the room, they\nremoved Landscape with Obelisk and The Concert from their frames.^[33] The\nfinal piece taken from the room was an ancient Chinese gu.^[34]\n\nAt 1:51 a.m., while one thief continued working in the Dutch Room, the other\nentered a narrow hallway dubbed the Short Gallery on the other end of the\nsecond floor. Soon both men were in the Short Gallery,^[29]^[34] where they\nbegan removing screws for a frame displaying a Napoleonic flag, likely an\neffort to steal the flag. They appeared to have abandoned the effort, as some\nscrews were not removed, and they ultimately took only the exposed eagle\nfinial atop the flagpole.^[34]^[35] They also took five Degas sketches from\nthe room.^[34]^[35] The last work stolen was Chez Tortoni from the Blue Room\non the first floor.^[26]^[35] The museum's motion detectors did not detect any\nmotion within the Blue Room during the thieves' time in the building.^[26] The\nonly footsteps detected in the room that night were Abath's during the two\ntimes when he passed through the gallery on his earlier patrol.^[26]\n\nAs they prepared to leave, the thieves checked the guards again and asked if\nthey were comfortable.^[36] The thieves then moved to the security director's\noffice, where they took the video cassettes that contained evidence of their\nentrance from the closed-circuit cameras as well as the data printouts from\nthe motion-detecting equipment. The movement data was also captured on a hard\ndrive, which remained untouched. The frame for Chez Tortoni was left at the\nsecurity director's desk.^[36] The thieves then began to remove the artwork\nfrom the museum. The side entrance doors were opened at 2:40 a.m. and again\nfor the last time at 2:45 a.m.^[37]^[36] The robbery lasted 81 minutes.^[36]\n\nThe next guard shift arrived later in the morning and realized that something\nwas amiss when they could not establish contact with anyone inside for\nadmittance. They called the security director, who entered the building with\nhis keys and found nobody at the watch desk before calling the\npolice.^[38]^[39] The police searched the building and found the guards still\nbound in the basement.^[40]^[41]\n\n## Stolen artwork[edit]\n\n  * The Concert \u2013 Vermeer\n\n  * The Storm on the Sea of Galilee \u2013 Rembrandt\n\n  * A Lady and Gentleman in Black \u2013 Rembrandt\n\n  * Landscape with Obelisk \u2013 Flinck\n\n  * Chez Tortoni \u2013 Manet\n\n  * Self-Portrait \u2013 Rembrandt\n\n  * La Sortie de Pesage \u2013 Degas\n\n  * Cortege aux Environs de Florence \u2013 Degas\n\n  * Program for an Artistic Soir\u00e9e 1 \u2013 Degas\n\n  * Program for an Artistic Soir\u00e9e 2 \u2013 Degas\n\n  * Three Mounted Jockeys \u2013 Degas\n\n  * An ancient Chinese gu\n\n  * A French Imperial Eagle finial\n\nThirteen works were stolen. In 1990, the FBI estimated the value of the theft\nat $200 million^[42] and raised the estimate to $500 million by 2000.^[42] In\nthe late 2000s, some art dealers suggested that the total value of the stolen\nartwork could be $600 million.^[43] It is considered the highest-value museum\nrobbery in history.^[citation needed]\n\nThe most valuable works were taken from the Dutch Room.^[44]^[45] Among these\nwas The Concert by Dutch painter Vermeer (1632\u201375), one of only 34^[a]\npaintings attributed to him.^[46] The painting accounts for half of the\noverall theft's value,^[43]^[47] estimated at $250 million in 2015.^[32]\nExperts believe that The Concert may be the most valuable stolen object in the\nworld.^[47]^[48] In the same room, the thieves targeted works by Dutch painter\nRembrandt (1606\u201369).^[44] These include The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, his\nonly seascape and the most valuable of his works stolen that night.^[49]^[25]\nEstimates have placed its value at about $140 million.^[42] The other\nRembrandt works taken were A Lady and Gentleman in Black and a small postage-\nstamp-sized self-portrait etching.^[32]^[42] The latter was previously stolen\nand returned in 1970.^[32] The thieves may have taken Landscape with Obelisk\nbelieving that it was a Rembrandt; it was long attributed to him until it was\nquietly credited to his pupil Govert Flinck (1615\u201360) a few years before the\nheist.^[32] The last item taken from the Dutch Room was a bronze gu about 10\ninches (25 cm) tall. Traditionally used for serving wine in ancient China, the\nbeaker was one of the oldest works in the museum, dating to the Shang Dynasty\nin the 12th century BC.^[50]^[20] Its estimated value is several thousand\ndollars.^[34]\n\nIn the Short Gallery, five sketches by French artist Edgar Degas (1834\u20131917)\nwere stolen.^[51] They were each drawn on paper less than a square foot in\nsize and made with pencils, inks, washes and charcoal.^[31] They are of\nrelatively little value compared with the other stolen works,^[31] worth under\n$100,000 combined.^[34] Also taken was a 10-inch-tall (25 cm) French Imperial\nEagle finial from the corner of a framed flag for Napoleon's Imperial Guard.\nThere is a $100,000 reward for information leading to the return of the finial\nalone.^[52] It possibly appeared to be made of gold to the thieves.^[46] Chez\nTortoni by French painter \u00c9douard Manet (1832\u20131883) was taken from the Blue\nRoom; it was the only item taken from the first floor.^[53]\n\nThe eclectic mix of items has puzzled experts.^[34]^[54] While some of the\npaintings were valuable, the thieves passed other valuable works by Raphael,\nBotticelli and Michelangelo and left them undisturbed, opting to take\nrelatively valueless items such as the gu and finial.^[54]^[29]^[34]^[35] The\nthieves did not enter the third floor where Titian's The Rape of Europa hung,\nwhich is among the most valuable paintings in the city.^[26]^[55] The\nselection of works and the thieves' rough treatment of the artwork has led\ninvestigators to believe that the thieves were not experts commissioned to\nsteal particular works.^[56]^[57]\n\nAs Gardner's will decreed that nothing in her collection should be moved, the\nempty frames for the stolen paintings remain hanging in their respective\nlocations in the museum as placeholders for their potential return.^[58]\nBecause of the museum's low funds and lack of an insurance policy, the\ndirector solicited help from Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses to post a\nreward of $1 million within three days.^[59] This was increased to $5 million\nin 1997.^[60] In 2017, it was doubled to $10 million with an expiration date\nset for the end of the year.^[61]^[62]^[63] This reward was extended following\nan outpouring of tips from the public.^[64] It is the largest bounty ever\noffered by a private institution.^[b]^[66] The reward is for \"information that\nleads directly to the recovery of all of [their] items in good\ncondition.\"^[67] Federal prosecutors have stated that anyone who willingly\nreturns the items will not be prosecuted. The statute of limitations expired\nin 1995 as well, so the thieves and anyone else who participated in the theft\ncannot be prosecuted.^[68]\n\n## Early leads and people of interest[edit]\n\nPolice sketches of the thieves\n\nThe FBI took immediate control of the case on the grounds that the artwork\ncould likely cross state lines.^[40]^[69] Investigators have called the case\nunique for its lack of strong physical evidence.^[70] It is unknown if the\nthieves left DNA evidence. Although fingerprints and footprints were found at\nthe scene, it could not be concluded whether they were from the thieves or\nfrom museum employees.^[70]^[71] The FBI has performed DNA analysis in the\nyears following the theft as advancements in the field have grown. Some of the\nevidence has been lost among the agency's files.^[72] The guards and witnesses\nin the street described one thief as about 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m) to 5 feet\n10 inches (1.78 m) in his late 30s with a medium build, and the other as 6\nfeet 0 inches (1.83 m) to 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) in his early 30s with a\nheavier build.^[13]^[73]\n\n### Rick Abath[edit]\n\nSecurity guard Richard Edward Abath was investigated at an early stage because\nof his suspicious behavior on the night of the theft.^[26]^[24]\n\n  * While on patrol, Abath briefly opened and closed a side door,^[16] a move that some believe could have been a signal to the thieves parked outside.^[74] Abath told authorities that he opened and closed the door routinely to ensure that it was locked.^[74] One of Abath's colleagues told journalists that if Abath had opened the door routinely as he maintained, supervisors would have noticed him doing so from their computer printouts and stopped the behavior.^[75]\n\n  * Suspicion has surrounded the museum's motion detectors, which did not detect any movement in the Blue Room (which housed Chez Tortoni) during the time the thieves were in the museum. The only footsteps in the room that night were Abath's during his security patrol.^[26] A security consultant reviewed the motion-detector equipment several weeks after the theft and determined they were operating correctly.^[26]\n  * In 2015, the FBI released a security video from the museum on the night before the theft showing Abath admitting an unidentified man into the museum to converse at the security desk. Abath told investigators that he could not recall the incident or recognize the man, and the FBI requested the public's assistance. Several former museum guards came forward and identified the stranger as the museum's deputy security chief.^[76]\n\nAbath, who died in 2024 at age 57,^[77] maintained his innocence throughout\nhis life.^[78]^[79] The FBI agent overseeing the case in its early years\nconcluded that the guards were too incompetent and foolish to have committed\nthe crime.^[24]\n\n### Whitey Bulger[edit]\n\nWhitey Bulger was one of the most powerful crime bosses in Boston during the\nera, heading the Winter Hill Gang.^[80] He denied involvement and in fact\ndispatched his subordinates to identify the culprits because the robbery was\ncommitted within his area and he wanted to be paid tribute.^[81]\n\nFBI agent Thomas McShane investigated Bulger to determine his\ninvolvement.^[80] He determined that Bulger's strong ties with the Boston\npolice could explain how the thieves acquired legitimate police uniforms, or\nperhaps that real police were arranged to perform the heist.^[80] Bulger also\nhad ties to the Irish Republican Army (IRA).^[80] McShane identified the act\nof tripping the fire alarm before the heist as a \"calling card\" of the IRA and\nof its rival Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).^[80] Both organizations had agents\nin Boston at the time, and both had previously demonstrated the capability to\norganize art heists.^[80] McShane's investigation of Bulger and the IRA did\nnot produce any evidence to tie them to the theft.^[82] According to Charley\nHill, a retired art and antiquities investigator for Scotland Yard, Bulger\ngave the Gardner works to the IRA and they are most likely in Ireland.^[83]\n\n### 1994 letter to the museum[edit]\n\nIn 1994, museum director Anne Hawley received an anonymous letter from someone\nwho claimed to be attempting to negotiate a return of the artwork.^[84] The\nwriter explained that they were a third-party negotiator and did not know the\nidentity of the thieves.^[85] They explained that the artwork was stolen to\nreduce a prison sentence, but as the opportunity had passed, there was no\nlonger a motive to keep the artwork and they wanted to negotiate a\nreturn.^[86] The writer explained that the artwork was being held in a \"non-\ncommon law country\" under climate-controlled conditions.^[87]^[85] They wanted\nimmunity for themselves and all others involved, and $2.6 million for return\nof the artwork, which would be sent to an offshore bank account at the same\ntime the art was handed over.^[85] If the museum was interested in\nnegotiating, they should print a coded message in The Boston Globe.^[88] To\nestablish credence, the writer conveyed information only known by the museum\nand FBI at the time.^[84]\n\nHawley felt this was a strong lead.^[89] She contacted the FBI, who then\ncontacted the Globe; the coded message was printed on May 1, 1994, edition of\nThe Boston Globe.^[90] Hawley received a second letter a few days later in\nwhich the writer acknowledged the museum was interested in negotiating, but\nthat they had become fearful of what they perceived was a massive\ninvestigation by federal and state authorities to determine their\nidentity.^[91] The writer explained that they needed time to evaluate their\noptions, but Hawley never heard from the writer again.^[92]\n\n### Brian McDevitt[edit]\n\nBrian McDevitt was a conman from Boston who tried to rob The Hyde Collection\nin Glens Falls, New York, in 1981. He dressed up as a FedEx driver, carried\nhandcuffs and duct tape, and planned to steal a Rembrandt.^[93] He was also a\nknown flag aficionado and fit the description of the larger robber except for\nhis thinning red hair.^[94] These parallels to the Gardner case fascinated the\nFBI, so they interviewed him in late 1990. McDevitt denied any involvement and\nrefused to take a polygraph test.^[93]^[94] The FBI ran his fingerprints which\ndid not match any of those at the crime scene.^[93] McDevitt later moved to\nCalifornia and conned his way into television and film writing.^[93]^[94] He\ndied in 2004.^[93]\n\n## Investigation of the Boston Mafia[edit]\n\n### Merlino gang[edit]\n\nThe FBI announced significant progress in their investigation in March 2013.\nThey reported \"with a high degree of confidence\" that they identified the\nthieves, which they believed were members of a criminal organization based in\nthe mid-Atlantic and New England. They also felt \"with that same confidence\"\nthat the artwork was transported to Connecticut and Philadelphia in the years\nfollowing the theft, with an attempted sale in Philadelphia in 2002. Their\nknowledge of what happened after that is limited, and they requested the\npublic's help to locate and return the artwork.^[95]^[67] In 2015, the FBI\nstated both thieves were deceased.^[96] Though the FBI did not publicly\nidentify any individuals, sources familiar with the investigation said they\nwere associated with a gang from Dorchester.^[95] The gang was loyal to Boston\nMafia boss Frank Salemme and ran their operations out of an automobile repair\nshop run by criminal Carmello Merlino.^[97]^[98]^[99]\n\nMerlino's associates may have gained knowledge of the museum's weaknesses\nafter gangster Louis Royce cased it as early as 1981.^[100]^[101] He devised\nplans with an associate to light up smoke bombs and rush the galleries amidst\nthe confusion.^[102]^[103] In 1982, when undercover FBI agents were\ninvestigating Royce and his associates for an unrelated art theft, they\nlearned of their interest in robbing the Gardner Museum and warned the museum\nof the gang's plan.^[104]^[105] Royce was in prison at the time of the\nrobbery.^[106] Royce shared his plan with others and believes associate\nStephen Rossetti may have ordered the robbery or shared it with someone\nelse.^[107]^[108]\n\n#### Robert Guarente and Robert Gentile[edit]\n\nAmong those associated with the Merlino gang were Robert Guarente and\nManchester, Connecticut, gangster Robert Gentile.^[109]^[110]^[111] Guarente\ndied from cancer in 2004,^[112] but his widow Elene told the FBI in 2010 that\nher husband had previously owned some of the paintings.^[111] She claimed that\nwhen her husband got sick with cancer in the early 2000s, he gave the\npaintings to Gentile for safekeeping.^[109]^[113] Gentile denied the\naccusations,^[113] claiming he was never given them and knew nothing of their\nwhereabouts.^[114] Federal authorities indicted Gentile on drug charges in\n2012, likely in an attempt to pressure Gentile for information about the\nGardner works.^[115] He submitted to a polygraph test which indicated he was\nlying when he denied any knowledge of the theft or location of the\nartwork.^[116] Gentile maintained he was telling the truth and demanded a\nretest. During the retest, he said Elene had once shown him the missing\nRembrandt self-portrait, to which the polygraph machine indicated he was\ntelling the truth.^[117] Gentile's lawyer felt that the veracity of Gentile's\nclaims were being affected by the large presence of federal agents and\nrequested a smaller meeting in hopes that it would get Gentile to speak\nhonestly.^[117] In the more intimate meeting, Gentile maintained that he did\nnot have any information.^[118]\n\nA few days later, the FBI stormed Gentile's house in Manchester with a search\nwarrant.^[119] The FBI found a secret ditch beneath a false floor in the\nbackyard shed but found it empty.^[120] Gentile's son explained that the ditch\nflooded a few years prior, and his father was upset about whatever was stored\nthere.^[121] In the basement, they found a copy of the Boston Herald from\nMarch 1990 reporting the theft along with a piece of paper indicating what\neach piece might sell for on the black market.^[119] Beyond this, no\nconclusive evidence was found to indicate he ever had the paintings.^[citation\nneeded] Gentile went to prison for 30 months on drug charges. If he knew\ninformation about the theft, at no point did he opt to share it, which would\nhave reduced his sentence or freed him from prison.^[citation needed] After\ngetting out of prison, he spoke with investigative reporter Stephen Kurkjian,\nclaiming he was framed by the FBI. He explained how the imprisonment was\ndetrimental to his finances and personal life.^[122] He also explained that\nthe list found in his basement was written up by a criminal trying to broker\nreturn of the works from Guarente and was talking to Gentile as an\nintermediary.^[123] When asked about what could have been in the ditch,\nGentile could not recall but believed it could have been small motors.^[121]\n\n#### David Turner[edit]\n\nDavid Turner was another associate of Merlino.^[124]^[125]^[99] The FBI began\ninvestigating him in 1992 when a source told them Turner had access to the\npaintings.^[126] Merlino was arrested that same year for cocaine trafficking\nand told authorities that he could return the paintings for a reduced prison\nsentence.^[127] He asked Turner to track down the paintings; Turner failed to\nreturn them, though he heard they were in a church in South\nBoston.^[128]^[129] Another associate arrested in the drug sting told\nauthorities about Turner's involvement in several break-ins but never\nmentioned the Gardner heist.^[129] Based on conversations with Merlino after\nhis release from prison in the mid 1990s, authorities gathered that Merlino\nnever had direct access to the paintings but possibly could broker for their\nreturn.^[130]\n\nDespite his claims of innocence, the FBI believes he may have been one of the\nthieves.^[131]^[132] Evidence indicates that he went to Florida to pick up a\ncocaine order just days before the heist,^[133] and credit card records\nsuggest he remained there through the night of the robbery,^[134]^[135] but\nsome investigators believe this may have been Turner's attempt at creating an\nalibi.^[citation needed] The FBI thinks the other thief was his friend and\nMerlino associate George Reissfelder.^[132]^[136] He died in July 1991.^[137]\nNo clues were found in his apartment or the homes of friends and\nrelatives,^[132]^[137] but his siblings recall a painting similar to Chez\nTortoni in his bedroom.^[132] Investigators believe he looks similar to the\nslimmer man in the police sketches.^[138]\n\nIn 1999, the FBI arrested Turner, Merlino, Rossetti, and others in a sting\noperation the day they planned to rob a Loomis Fargo vault.^[139]^[99] When\nthe FBI brought Turner in for questioning, they told him they had information\nthat he participated in the Gardner robbery, and that if he returned the\npaintings they would let him go.^[140] He told the authorities he did not know\nwho stole the paintings nor where they could be hidden.^[141] In his 2001\ntrial, he claimed entrapment, that the FBI let the Loomis Fargo plot proceed\nso they could pressure him for information about the Gardner paintings.^[141]\nThe jury found him guilty, and he was sent to prison.^[140] Turner knew\nGentile through Guarente; in 2010 he wrote a letter to Gentile asking if he\ncould call Turner's former girlfriend to assist in recovering the Gardner\npaintings.^[142] In cooperation with the FBI, Gentile spoke with Turner's\ngirlfriend, and she told him that Turner wanted him to speak with two of his\nex-convict friends in Boston.^[143] The FBI wanted Gentile to meet the men and\nsend an FBI undercover agent with him, but Gentile did not want to cooperate\nfurther.^[143] Turner was freed in November 2019, one month after\nRossetti.^[144] Merlino died in prison in 2005.^[144]\n\n### Bobby Donati[edit]\n\nFurther information: Bobby Donati \u00a7 Possible role in Gardner Museum theft\n\nBobby Donati in an undated photo\n\nCriminal Bobby Donati was murdered in 1991 in the midst of a gang war within\nthe Patriarca crime family.^[145]^[146] His involvement in the Gardner theft\nwas suspected after notorious New England art thief Myles J. Connor Jr. spoke\nwith authorities.^[147]^[148] Connor was in jail at the time of the\nheist,^[149] but he believed Donati and criminal David Houghton were the\nmasterminds.^[149] Connor had worked with Donati in past art heists^[150] and\nclaimed the two cased the Gardner Museum^[149]^[151] where Donati took\ninterest in the finial.^[149] Connor also claimed that Houghton visited him in\njail after the heist and said that he and Donati organized it and were going\nto use the paintings to get Connor out of jail.^[150] If this is true, they\nlikely borrowed the idea from Connor as he returned art to reduce sentences in\nthe past.^[151] Even though Donati's and Houghton's appearances did not fit\nthe witness descriptions, Connor suggested they probably hired lower-level\ngangsters to carry out the robbery.^[149] Like Donati, Houghton also died\nwithin two years of the robbery, though from an illness rather than\nmurder.^[149] Connor told investigators he could assist in returning the\nGardner works in exchange for the museum's posted reward and his\nfreedom.^[149] When investigators did not give in to Connor's demands because\nof lack of evidence, he suggested they speak with criminal and antiques dealer\nWilliam P. Youngworth.^[149]\n\nActing on Connor's lead, the FBI opened a case on Youngworth and conducted\nraids on his home and antique store properties in the 1990s.^[152]^[147]^[153]\nThe raids caught the attention of journalist Tom Mashberg, who began talking\nwith Youngworth in 1997 about the theft.^[152]^[147] One night in August 1997,\nYoungworth called Mashberg and told him he had proof he could return the\nGardner paintings under the right conditions.^[154] That night, Youngworth\npicked up Mashberg from the Boston Herald offices and drove him to a warehouse\nin Red Hook, Brooklyn.^[154]^[155] Youngworth led him inside to a storage unit\nwith several large cylinder tubes. He removed one painting from its tube,\nunfurled it, and showed it to Mashberg under flashlight. It appeared to\nMashberg to be The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. He noticed cracking along the\ncanvas, and the edges were cut in a manner consistent with the museum's\nreports,^[156] and he noticed Rembrandt's signature on the ship's\nrudder.^[157] Mashberg wrote about his experience in the Boston Herald,\nleaving out details to hide Youngworth's identity and the painting's\nlocation.^[158] He reported that his \"informant\" (presumably Youngworth) told\nhim the robbery was pulled off by five men and identified two: Donati was one\nof the robbers, and Houghton was responsible for moving the art to a safe\nhouse.^[159] The FBI discovered the location of the warehouse several months\nlater and raided it, finding nothing.^[160]\n\nThe veracity of Youngworth's claims and the authenticity of the painting shown\nto Mashberg is disputed.^[161] Youngworth supplied paint chips to Mashberg,\nand federal authorities reported that they were indeed from Rembrandt's era\nbut did not match oils used for The Storm on the Sea of Galilee.^[161] The way\nMashberg described the painting as being \"unfurled\" has also been scrutinized,\nas the stolen painting was covered with a heavy varnish that would not roll\neasily.^[161] Federal authorities and the museum began working with Youngworth\nafter Mashberg's story was published, but Youngworth made negotiations\ndifficult.^[160] He would not work with authorities unless his demands could\nbe met, which included full immunity and Connor's release from\njail.^[160]^[162]^[163] The authorities were skeptical of Youngworth's\nveracity and only offered partial immunity.^[163] The United States attorney\noverseeing the case eventually ceased talks with Youngworth unless he could\nprovide more reliable evidence that he had access to the Gardner works.^[160]\nYoungworth again provided a vial of paint chips, purportedly from The Storm on\nthe Sea of Galilee, and 25 color photographs of the painting and A Lady and\nGentleman in Black.^[164] A joint statement from the museum and federal\ninvestigators announced that the chips were not from the stolen Rembrandts,\nthough they did test as being from 17th century paintings and could\npotentially be from The Concert.^[165]\n\nIn 2014, investigative reporter Stephen Kurkjian wrote to gangster Vincent\nFerrara, Donati's superior during the gang war, inquiring if he had\ninformation about the Gardner theft.^[166]^[167] He received a call back from\nan associate of Ferrara who explained the FBI was wrong in suspecting the\nMerlino gang's involvement and claimed that Donati organized the\nrobbery.^[166] The caller explained that Donati visited Ferrara in jail about\nthree months before the theft, after the latter was charged for murder,^[168]\nand told Ferrara that he was going to do something to get him out of\njail.^[169] Three months later, Ferrara heard news about the Gardner\ntheft,^[169] after which Donati visited him again and confirmed to Ferrara\nthat he was involved in the robbery.^[170] He claimed to have buried the\nartwork and would start a negotiation for his release once the investigation\ncooled down.^[145] The negotiations never occurred because Donati was\nmurdered.^[145] Kurkjian believes Donati was motivated to free Ferrara from\nprison because Ferrara could protect him in the gang war.^[167] A friend of\nGuarente also corroborated that Donati organized the robbery, and that Donati\ngave paintings to Guarente when he became concerned for his own safety.^[171]\nDonati was close friends with Guarente.^[172] The two were seen at a social\nclub in Revere shortly before the robbery with a bag of police uniforms.^[172]\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ The number of paintings attributed to Vermeer is disputed.\n  2. ^ The Gardner Museum's reward has only been exceeded by the US government's $25 million bounty for Osama bin Laden.^[65]\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b \"Isabella Stewart Gardner\". www.gardnermuseum.org.
