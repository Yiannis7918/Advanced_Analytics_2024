A channel where I give my unwanted\nopinion about other people's countries as well as of my own. Here you can find\ncynical travel videos showing the good, the bad, and the ugly of Europe. No\nfake positivity here! And also videos showing the weirder lesser known things\nabout Europe. There's a new video every 2 weeks. 1 video will be a travel\nvideo, where I actually move my lazy ass and go outside to film. And the other\nvideo will be some filler European culture/history. I got uni, I can't travel\nall willy nilly. I'm not a millionaire... yet... So yeah, if you think this\nchannel is the place for you, feel free to click that subscribe button! And if\nnot, idk... go watch some my little pony friendship is magic or some Balkan\nInfo or whatever you're into.
