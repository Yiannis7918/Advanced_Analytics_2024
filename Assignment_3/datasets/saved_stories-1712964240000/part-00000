Simultaneously, we are removing the DST Root CA X3\ncross-sign from our API, aligning with our strategy to shorten the Let\u2019s\nEncrypt chain of trust. We will begin issuing ECDSA end-entity certificates\nfrom a default chain that just contains a single ECDSA intermediate, removing\na second intermediate and the option to issue an ECDSA end-entity certificate\nfrom an RSA intermediate. The Let\u2019s Encrypt staging environment will make an\nequivalent change on April 24th, 2024.\n\nMost Let\u2019s Encrypt Subscribers will not need to take any action in response to\nthis change because ACME clients, like certbot, will automatically configure\nthe new intermediates when certificates are renewed. The Subscribers who will\nbe affected are those who currently pins intermediate certificates (more on\nthat later).\n\nThe following diagram depicts what the new hierarchy looks like. You can see\ndetails of all of the certificates on our updated Chain of Trust documentation\npage.\n\n## New Intermediate Certificates\n\nEarlier this year, Let\u2019s Encrypt generated new intermediate keys and\ncertificates. They will replace the current intermediates, which were issued\nin September 2020 and are approaching their expiration.\n\nAll certificates - issued by both RSA and ECDSA intermediates - will be served\nwith a default chain of ISRG Root X1 \u2192 (RSA or ECDSA) Intermediate \u2192 End-\nEntity Certificate. That is, all certificates, regardless of whether you\nchoose to have an RSA or ECDSA end-entity certificate, will have one\nintermediate which is directly signed by the ISRG Root X1, which is Let\u2019s\nEncrypt\u2019s most widely trusted root.\n\nThe new ECDSA intermediates will also have an alternate chain to ISRG Root X2:\nISRG Root X2 \u2192 ECDSA Intermediate \u2192 End-Entity Certificate. This is only\napplicable to a small number of Subscribers who prefer the smallest TLS\nhandshake possible. To use this ECDSA-only chain, see your ACME client\u2019s\ndocumentation on how to request alternate chains. There will not be any\nalternative chains for the RSA intermediates.\n\nIt is important to note that there will now be multiple active RSA and two\nactive ECDSA intermediates at the same time. An RSA leaf certificate may be\nsigned by any of the active RSA intermediates (a value from \u201cR10\u201d to \u201cR14\u201d in\nthe issuer common name field of your certificate), and an ECDSA leaf\ncertificate may be signed by any of the active ECDSA intermediates (\u201cE5\u201d\nthrough \u201cE9\u201d). Again, your ACME client should handle this automatically.\n\nA Certificate Authority\u2019s intermediate certificates expire every few years and\nneed to be replaced, just like a website\u2019s certificate is routinely renewed.\nGoing forward, Let\u2019s Encrypt intends to switch what intermediates are in use\nannually, which will help enhance the overall security of the certificates.\n\n## Removing DST Root CA X3 Cross-sign\n\nThe new intermediate chains will not include the DST Root CA X3 cross-sign, as\npreviously announced in our post about Shortening the Let\u2019s Encrypt Chain of\nTrust. By eliminating the cross-sign, we\u2019re making our certificates leaner and\nmore efficient, leading to faster page loads for Internet users. We already\nstopped providing the cross-sign in the default certificate chain on February\n8th, 2024, so if your ACME client is not explicitly requesting the chain with\nDST Root CA X3, this will not be a change for you.\n\n## ECDSA Intermediates as Default for ECDSA Certificates\n\nCurrently, ECDSA end-entity certificates are signed by our RSA intermediates\nunless users opted in via a request form to use our ECDSA intermediates. With\nour new intermediates, we will begin issuing all ECDSA end-entity certificates\nfrom the ECDSA intermediates. The request form and allow-list will no longer\nbe used, which we had introduced to make ECDSA intermediates available.\n\nEarlier, the default ECDSA chain included two intermediates: both E1 and the\ncross-signed ISRG Root X2 (i.e. ISRG Root X1 \u2192 ISRG Root X2 \u2192 E1 \u2192 End-Entity\nCertificate). After the change, it will contain only a single intermediate:\nthe version of one of our new ECDSA intermediates cross-signed by ISRG Root X1\n(i.e. ISRG Root X1 \u2192 E5 \u2192 End-Entity Certificate). This ensures that all of\nour intermediates, both RSA and ECDSA, are signed directly by our most widely-\ntrusted ISRG Root X1.\n\nWe expect this change to benefit most users with smaller TLS handshakes. If\ncompatibility problems with ECDSA intermediates arise, we recommend Let\u2019s\nEncrypt users switch to RSA certificates. Android 7.0 is known to have a bug\npreventing it from working with most Elliptic Curve (EC) certificates,\nincluding our ECDSA intermediates; however, that version of Android doesn\u2019t\ntrust our ISRG Root X1 and thus is already incompatible.\n\n## Risks of Pinning or Hard-Coding Intermediates\n\nWe do not recommend pinning or otherwise hard-coding intermediates or roots.\nPinning intermediates is especially not advisable as they change often. If you\ndo pin intermediates, make sure you have the complete set of new intermediates\n(available here).\n\n## Questions?\n\nWe\u2019re grateful for the millions of subscribers who have trusted us to carry\nout best practices to make the web more secure and privacy-respecting, and\nrotating intermediates more frequently is one of them.
