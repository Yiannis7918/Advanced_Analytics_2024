Few people have unpacked our behaviors with greater insight than\nKahneman and his longtime collaborator, Amos Tversky. In the wake of his\npassing, we\u2019ve been reflecting on the many ways his work has shaped our\nthinking. Something I wish I\u2019d figured out when I was younger is that\ngreatness is in the agency of others. I have often tried to identify a guide\nor sherpa for different aspects of my life. Jesus and Muhammed Ali are my\nYodas around social issues (love the poor, be fearless and poetic) and Peter\nDrucker informs my views on the economy (the purpose of an economy is to\ncreate a middle class), etc. Professor Kahneman helps me navigate the strait\nbetween instinct and decision. Some thoughts:\n\n#### Homo Irrational\n\nKahneman studied how humans make decisions, and the shortcuts our minds take,\nunbeknownst to us. These shortcuts are efficient; they foster a key skill for\nsurvival, the ability to make rapid decisions with incomplete information. We\nhave to make thousands of decisions every day, and we couldn\u2019t leave the house\nif we had to objectively analyze every choice: breakfast, outfit, route,\nmusic, etc.\n\nOur efficiency comes at the cost of accuracy: Many instinctual decisions will\nbe poorly calibrated (i.e., wrong). To facilitate the requisite speed, our\nbrain buttresses our decisions with artificial confidence. Kahneman\u2019s body of\nwork demonstrates that we are often wrong but frequently confident. These\nshortcuts and mistakes are present in the structure of our brains, and\nimpossible to avoid, but recognizing them helps us discern between trivial and\nimportant decisions and invest the appropriate intellectual capital. Put\nanother way, take a beat and you increase the likelihood of making a better\ndecision.\n\nThough he was a psychologist by training, Kahneman got his Nobel Prize for\neconomics. Before him, economists \u201crelied on the assumption of a \u2018homo\n\u0153conomicus,\u2019\u201d as the prize committee wrote, a self-interested being capable of\nrational decision-making. But Kahneman \u201cdemonstrated how human decisions may\nsystematically depart from those predicted by standard economic theory.\u201d That\ndry language obscures an intellectual nuclear detonation. Expectations about\nhuman decisions \u2014 whether to work at a certain job, how much to pay for a\nspecific good \u2014 are the foundation of economic theory. Kahneman showed those\nexpectations were incorrect.\n\n#### Loss Aversion\n\nOne of Kahneman and Tversky\u2019s earliest insights was the simple observation\nthat we feel the pain of loss more intensely than the pleasure of profit. It\u2019s\nirrational to an economist, but we put more value on not losing $100 than we\ndo on gaining $100.\n\nWe also have a skewed perception of probable gains and losses: We overestimate\nthe likelihood of unlikely things. Insurance is a profitable business because\npeople would rather suffer a series of guaranteed small losses (premiums) to\navoid the risk of a single but unlikely catastrophic loss. The healthy profit\nmargins of insurance companies reflect our tendency to overestimate the\nlikelihood of calamities. Overestimating an unlikely outcome is also the\nsecret behind the lotto, which offers terrible odds. Some examples of how this\nhas influenced my actions. (Note: I am not claiming these are the right way to\nput Kahneman\u2019s insights to use, just my way.) What I\u2019ve done:\n\nI actively limit the number of decisions I have to make to preserve neuron\npower for the key ones. I have other people order for me at restaurants; I\nhave a uniform for work/working out, wearing the same thing every day, and\nsomeone else buys my clothes. I delegate the majority of decisions at Prof G\nMedia \u2014 I participate in a one-hour weekly editorial meeting and check in with\nmy executive producer 2x per month on business issues. I have not planned a\nvacation in 20 years or put anything on my calendar in 10. Despite having made\nmore than 30 investments in private firms over the past decade, I review few\ndocuments, and rarely even sign them. (That\u2019s all handled by counsel.) I try\nto reserve the largest possible cache of gray matter for research, thinking,\nstorytelling (writing, presentations, etc.), and investment decisions. Over\nthe next five years, I plan to outsource all investment decisions so I can\nfocus on storytelling.\n\nSeven years ago, I canceled all my insurance coverage \u2014 health, life,\nproperty, flood, etc. I don\u2019t own a car, but when I did, we purchased the\nminimum amount required by law. This is a position of privilege (don\u2019t cancel\nyour health insurance), as there is no disease or property loss that would\ncause me financial strain. Since adopting this strategy, I\u2019ve saved $1.4\nmillion in premiums.\n\nMy belief in the market\u2019s collective loss aversion has reshaped my investment\nportfolio over the past decade. The majority (90+%) of my investments used to\nbe in publicly traded stocks. That share is now less than 20%. Instead, I lean\ninto my access to private companies, as I can absorb big losses and withstand\nilliquidity. Per Kahneman, there have been periods of real pain. In the last\n12 months I\u2019ve registered four wipeouts \u2014 four investments that dropped to\nzero. However, two other investments registered a 4x and 25x return. My net\nreturn has beaten the market, but it\u2019s been more taxing (emotionally) than\njust investing in SPY, as I have trouble shaking the big losses \u2014 again,\nmaking Kahneman\u2019s point.\n\n#### Take a Beat\n\nProspect theory won Kahneman his Nobel, but he\u2019s best known for his seminal\nbook, Thinking, Fast and Slow. The titular concept \u2014 that we have two thinking\nsystems, a fast one for intuitive, emotional insights, and a slow one for\nlogical, calculated decisions \u2014 is something that has saved me from ... me,\ndozens of times.\n\nOur fast thinking system is an incredible tool. It allows us to drive cars,\ncompare prices, recognize friends at a distance, and play sports. But its\navailability makes us lazy. Why do the hard work of thinking through a problem\nwhen we can just \u201cgo with our gut\u201d? In any decision of consequence, it\u2019s good\npolicy to slow down, get out of the stimulus-response cycle, and let your slow\nthinking catch up. That\u2019s not to say we should disregard our gut \u2014 just don\u2019t\nlet it take the wheel.\n\nSpecifically, I try to be vigilant about not letting my fast system make\ndecisions that merit the attention of my slow system. Often these are\nreactions to things that upset me. Last week, a journalist who\u2019s active on\nsocial media posted on Threads that Jonathan Haidt and I were \u201cgrifters,\u201d and\nthat I did not care about young people. This pissed me off.\n\nFeeling threatened, my lizard brain took over, and I saw the situation as a\nconflict, a threat to my standing in the community. That framing, courtesy of\nmy instinctive, fast thinking system, dominated my consciousness for the next\nfour hours, distracting me from my kids and vacation. I drafted an angry\nresponse to counter the threat.\n\nThen I shared the situation with several members of my team. Able to evaluate\nthe situation dispassionately, they were universal in their response. \u201cLet it\ngo.\u201d I was just playing into an attempt to draw attention with ad hominem\nattacks the algorithms love. (e.g. Trump or Musk.) The learning, other than\nsocial media is a cancer? Speaking to others, before acting, is a great way to\nslow your thinking.\n\n#### Happiness, Diminishing Returns, and Taxes\n\nIn 2010, Kahneman and another Nobel winner, Angus Deaton, published a study\nwhich appeared to show conclusively that income was strongly correlated with\nhappiness at low income levels, but that income above $75,000 had no impact on\nhappiness. The study was widely celebrated, but in 2021 a much less famous\nacademic, Matthew Killingsworth at Wharton, published a paper reaching a\ncontrary conclusion, based on a sophisticated smartphone-based happiness\ntracking system.\n\nRather than ignore the unknown academic challenging him, or using his global\nfame to undermine the upstart, as is the norm in Congress or pretty much\nanywhere else, Kahneman teamed up with Killingsworth. They engaged in a\ncollaboration alongside a third academic neutral to the dispute \u2014 a process\nKahneman pioneered. Working together, they found that Kahneman\u2019s original\nstudy had measured the decrease in unhappiness but hadn\u2019t captured the upside\nhigh-income people enjoyed. When more carefully measured, happiness did\ncontinue rising with income. However, there were dramatic diminishing returns.\nThere were real gains to happiness in moving from $100,000 income to $200,000,\nbut to see that same gain again required another doubling of income to\n$400,000. Extend the curve, and it flattens further.\n\nI believe this should influence tax policy. A substantial increase in the\nprogressivity of income tax would offer a net positive in overall well-being.\nAccording to the IRS, 26,576 U.S. households reported income of over $10\nmillion in 2020, totalling $824 billion in income. We collected $210 billion\nincome tax from these filers, or 25% of their income. If we collected an\nadditional 25% of just the income over $10 million, there would be little\nimpact on the lifestyle or happiness of these taxpayers.\n\nBut the additional $140 billion in revenue could cut child poverty in half\n($100 billion) and end homelessness ($20 billion). These investments would\ngenerate a massive increase in the well-being of our commonwealth and a huge\neconomic boon. (These societal ills cost us trillions in lost productivity.)\nPlus, we\u2019d have enough left over to pay for most of NASA ($25 billion). And\nrich people love space.\n\n#### Disassociate\n\nIdeas are yours to play with, disassemble, shape, and apply where needed. I\u2019ve\ntaken the idea of \u201cslowing down\u201d and mixed it with atheism and stoicism to\nenhance my personal relationships. When my kids are disagreeable (i.e.,\nawful), or my partner is upset/angry, I often respond as if it\u2019s a threat to\nmy authority or value. I reflexively escalate and get back in their face(s). I\nnow try to disassociate. What I mean by that: I take myself out of my \u201cself\u201d\nand see someone I care about upset. Being an observer, vs. being in the line\nof fire, inspires different emotions.\n\nWhen my kid is agitated, I recognize it\u2019s more about what they are\nexperiencing elsewhere, and they know that \u2014 no matter how unreasonable they\nare \u2014 I will still love them unconditionally. When my partner is upset, my\nrole is to notice it, to give witness to their life. Their emotions matter,\nregardless of my ego or the perceived criticism. I can take arrows, get shot\nin the face, and never lose sight of my role as their protector. I am the man\nof the house. If that sounds like we digress to traditional gender roles,\ntrust your instincts. I\u2019ve slowed down, thought about it, and determined it\nworks for us.\n\nLife is so rich,\n\nP.S.

His wife\nmakes $70k. Yet they pay no taxes. They look poor on paper and as such benefit\nfrom many welfare programs because of clever manipulation of the tax code. Not\nfood stamps but many other programs. Because assets aren\u2019t considered. Free\ntickets to all the fine arts, subsidized health insurance, etc.\n\nSo in both cases a tax rate increase isn\u2019t such a big deal.\n\nI don\u2019t hate the player. I do hate the game.

If\nour government would agree to to invest the money toward those issues that\nwould be amazing but we know it would never happen they would just waste it on\nsome nonsense or it would get lost in the system\n\nReply\n\n  5.

I am the man of the house.\nIf that sounds like we digress to traditional gender roles\u201d \u2013 I think it\u2019s\nentirely feminist for being the \u201cman of the house\u201d to include being everyone\u2019s\nprotector, as long as it\u2019s a role that is also, simultaneously, available to\nthe \u201cwoman of the house.\u201d Everyone, no matter their age or gender, deserves\nsomeone to protect them in some way. Feminism is about expanding roles and\nopportunities, far more than about taking them away.\n\nReply\n\n## Join the 500,000 who subscribe\n\nTo resist is futile ... new content every Friday.\n\nBy subscribing, you agree to receive emails from Scott Galloway and his edtech\nstartup, Section.
