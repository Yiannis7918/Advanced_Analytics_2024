It mostly emerges after the age of 50 and becomes\nmore frequent as men age.\n\nAs life expectancy improves in developing countries, the number of prostate\ncancer cases also increases, the researchers said.\n\nThey stressed that public health policies could not affect the change as they\ncould with lung cancer or heart diseases.\n\nHereditary factors are much less manageable than, for example, smoking is in\nthe cause of lung cancer. A link with weight has been established but it is\nnot yet known if this a direct cause of prostate cancer.\n\nResearchers also said that health authorities had to encourage earlier\nscreening in developing countries as the disease is often diagnosed too late\nto give an effective treatment.\n\n\u00a9 Agence France-Presse\n\nTrending News\n\nVenting Doesn't Reduce Anger, But Something Else Does, Study Finds Humans4\ndays ago\n\nRare Genetic Variants Are Curiously Connected With Being Left-Handed Humans3\ndays ago\n\nScientists Identified Four Distinct Sleep Types \u2013 And How They Affect Health\nHealth2 days ago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
