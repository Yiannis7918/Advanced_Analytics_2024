Swift\nPress, 360 pp., \u00a325, July 2023, 978 1 80075 384 6Read More\n\nShow All\n\nDuring the Covid lockdowns of 2020, an influx of central bank injections into\nWestern capital markets sent stock indices soaring. A few listed companies\nbecame social media favourites, leading to frenzied buying on the part of\nmostly young, mostly male amateur investors, stuck at home trading equities on\nmobile apps such as Robinhood. These hyped-up stocks \u2013 ranging from GameStop\nto Tesla \u2013 became known as \u2018meme stocks\u2019 and this episode as the \u2018meme stock\ncraze\u2019. A Chinese electric vehicle start-up called Nio, which had listed on\nthe New York Stock Exchange in 2018, was among them. On the brink of\nbankruptcy in late 2019, with shares down to $1.4, Nio\u2019s stock shot up in the\nsecond half of 2020, briefly surpassing $60 in January 2021. By that point,\nthe company was worth more than $90 billion, making it the fourth most\nvaluable car firm in the world after Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen. (Nio still\nexists: its sales are steadily expanding and its stock is back down below\n$10.)\n\nNio\u2019s wild stock market ride is an object lesson in the operation of\nspeculative finance. What happened to the company in the early months of 2020,\njust before it became a meme stock, is an object lesson in something rather\nless run-of-the-mill: the Hefei Model. The city of Hefei, 250 miles west of\nShanghai, is the capital of Anhui province and a prefecture-level city, an\nadministrative rank held by around three hundred Chinese cities (more\nsignificant centres, such as Jinan or Ningbo, have vice-provincial rank).\nHefei is also an economic success story: its GDP more than quadrupled between\n2010 and 2022 while China\u2019s merely doubled. This performance has been\nattributed to the city government\u2019s economic strategy, which involves\nselectively deploying investment funds it controls to organise the growth of\nmanufacturing supply chains in high-tech sectors. Having decided that electric\nvehicles should be a priority sector, the city government invested the\nequivalent of $1 billion in Nio in April 2020, at a time when the company was\nshort of funding and its valuation was low. As part of the deal, Nio moved its\nheadquarters from Shanghai to Hefei. Hefei profited handsomely from the\noperation, cashing out of most of its stake within a year \u2013 thanks, in part,\nto the lockdown meme stock traders.\n\nThe ingredients of the Hefei Model can be traced back several decades. Ever\nsince the late Mao era, the city has benefited from the presence of one of\nChina\u2019s leading research institutions, the University of Science and\nTechnology of China \u2013 which ranks among the top universities in the world in\ncertain hard sciences and engineering sub-disciplines. Hefei\u2019s foremost\ndevelopment zone \u2013 the Hefei National High-tech Industry Development Zone, to\nthe west of the city centre \u2013 was set up in the early 1990s as part of the\nvery first batch of national high-tech development zones in China.\n\nHefei isn\u2019t a hedge fund. Its municipal bureaus and investment vehicles are\nconcerned with jobs and industry, from securing land for manufacturing\nfacilities to ensuring that supplier networks for major firms are, to the\nextent that this is possible, based in the city. This has sometimes come at a\ncost \u2013 at least in the short term. In the wake of the financial crisis of\n2008, city officials saw an opportunity to invest in a struggling technology\ncompany called BOE. They pulled the funding for a new subway line and put it\ninto BOE, on the condition that the company build a plant in Hefei. The\nrelationship has been successful: the city has invested in further plants and\nBOE has created thousands of jobs there (it\u2019s now the world\u2019s leading\nmanufacturer of TV screens). In 2020, a \u2018supply chain boss system\u2019 was\nintroduced, allowing a high-ranking municipal official to assume\nresponsibility over planning in each of sixteen key supply chains in the city.\nFor instance, Hefei\u2019s top official, party secretary Yu Aihua, has been charged\nwith overseeing the semiconductor supply chain \u2013 a significant role given\nChina\u2019s rivalry with the US.\n\nThe city government uses a triumvirate of investment platforms \u2013 Hefei\nJiantou, Hefei Chantou and Hefei Xingtai \u2013 to acquire minority stakes in\nprivately owned companies. Their combined assets have already reached 780\nbillion yuan (more than $100 billion). Investments are often made in\npartnership with other actors \u2013 a provincial-level government fund, for\ninstance, or a Chinese investment group. The city authorities don\u2019t aim to\ntake direct control of the firms they target for investment and the platforms\nimpose a degree of separation between administrative bureaus and corporate\ndecision-making. Divestment from a company is expected once the city\u2019s\nobjectives \u2013 defined in terms of supply chain development \u2013 are met. In March\n2022, it completed its financial arsenal by launching the Hefei High-Quality\nDevelopment Guidance Fund which, private equity-style, operates as a \u2018fund of\nfunds\u2019, attracting outside capital into dozens of subordinate funds (47 had\nbeen set up as of March 2023) covering \u2018seed, angel, scientific innovation and\nproduction\u2019 investments. While Hefei\u2019s investment funds are under the purview\nof the city government, they do not usually rely on money from the city\nbudget. Being profitable across their investments is part of these funds\u2019\nmandate, and most of their profits are retained for further investment. In the\nevent of financial vulnerability, the funds would turn first to capital\nmarkets, or banks, or other corporate entities for financial support \u2013 not to\nthe city budget.\n\nThere is nothing exceptional in governments supporting industrial development.\nEuropean states have always done so, if to a fluctuating degree. And state\nintervention is common in car manufacturing. Toyota was protected against\nforeign competition for decades until it finally broke into overseas markets\nin the 1960s. General Motors and Chrysler were dramatically bailed out by the\nUS government in 2008. The involvement of sub-national jurisdictions isn\u2019t\nunusual either: Lower Saxony currently holds 11.8 per cent of the stock (and\n20 per cent of voting rights) in Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s largest car maker.\n\nBut the state involvement in market activity in present-day China is\nunparalleled in major countries. Not only is the state\u2019s capacity to influence\neconomic outcomes stronger than has ever been the case in the West (except for\nperiods of war), the breadth of China\u2019s statist panoply is remarkable: from\ncorporate behemoths answering to Beijing to minority equity stakes in start-\nups as in Hefei; from regulatory practices so fine-grained that they are\ncloser to direction than regulation, to the sui generis role of the CCP\nhierarchy, which extends from party departments in government offices to party\ncommittees inside enterprises. China\u2019s sheer size, and the revival of\ndecentralised decision-making since the early post-Mao decades, means that a\ngreat deal of economic statecraft occurs at lower levels: provinces, cities,\ndistricts, counties, townships and so on.\n\nNot all local authorities are as successful as Hefei. There have been cases of\ndeteriorating competitiveness and deindustrialisation, as well as debt crises\nin a number of places. Corporate investment in the country is finite and local\ngovernments are vying to attract as much of it as they can. All the while,\nBeijing presides over the nation\u2019s multi-scalar economy, preserving its\nmonopoly over what is commonly referred to as \u2018top-level design\u2019. This\nexpression, a favourite of the Xi era, affirms the supreme prerogative of\nChina\u2019s political centre and assigns to it an overarching \u2018design\u2019 function.\nImplementation happens locally, with municipal governments called on to fill\nout the blanks in Beijing\u2019s blueprints.\n\nThe Hefei Model is only the most recent Chinese regional development model;\nearlier models include the Sunan Model in the 1980s, the Pudong Model in the\n1990s and the ill-fated Chongqing Model in the 2000s \u2013 each of which had its\nown distinctive form of local-level statism. The Hefei Model updates statism\nfor an age in which an overarching emphasis on technology and innovation meets\nthe expansive logic of financialisation, which is reshaping modes of state\ninvolvement in the economy. In The New China Playbook, Keyu Jin characterises\nHefei as an exemplar of the \u2018mayor economy\u2019. Jin doesn\u2019t explain the source of\nthe phrase, though Wang Minzheng, an official of Yunnan\u2019s provincial\ngovernment and a former mayor of the prefecture-level city of Zhaotong, wrote\na well-received treatise called Mayor Economics in 2010. \u2018In the mayor\neconomy,\u2019 Jin writes, \u2018local governments have strong incentives to help\npromising businesses overcome barriers and to foster innovation in their\nlocality. Adam Smith\u2019s concept of invisible hands working behind the scenes\nis, in the case of China, replaced by the thousand-arm Buddha\u2019s extended and\nvery visible hands.\u2019 (Her book relies heavily on allegories and similes of\nthis sort.)\n\nJin argues that, in contradistinction to the West\u2019s free market economy, China\nhas a \u2018hybrid economy\u2019 combining the multi-scalar statism of the \u2018mayor\neconomy\u2019 and elements of the market economy. She claims that a new political-\neconomic model is taking shape under Xi Jinping, replacing the \u2018old playbook\u2019\nthat defined the post-Mao reform era up to the 2010s. In order to catch up\nwith Western countries, Chinese leaders took \u2018short cuts\u2019, focusing on GDP\ngrowth even when it meant bending the rules, wasting resources and degrading\nthe environment. The \u2018new playbook\u2019, by contrast, involves less cronyism (she\ncites Xi\u2019s anti-corruption campaign) and better regulation. It also\nprioritises technological innovation and environmental sustainability, while\nseeking to respond to the demand of younger people for a better quality of\nlife.\n\n\u2018In China,\u2019 Jin writes, \u2018the mayor economy rivals the market economy in\nimportance.\u2019 But does any such rivalry exist? Political discourse tends to\nframe policy issues as a matter of state v. market. This can be misleading,\nhowever, because it conflates two distinct spheres of economic reality: the\nmechanism for allocating resources and the identity of the resources\u2019 owners.\nA state-owned enterprise can respond to market signals \u2013 in fact, it usually\ndoes \u2013 and conversely a privately owned firm may choose, or be compelled, to\nmake hires, purchases and sales via non-market channels. For instance, China\u2019s\nlargest car manufacturer, SAIC, a state-owned firm, competes with both private\nand government-controlled firms to sell its vehicles. In Western countries,\nit\u2019s not unheard of for governments to impose operational decisions on private\nenterprises, though this power is usually employed only in times of war or\nother emergencies, and is made possible by legal instruments such as the US\u2019s\nDefence Production Act.\n\nUntil the early 1990s, China\u2019s planning apparatus still set prices for the\nproducts of most industrial firms. In the 1980s, market prices existed\nalongside government-mandated prices in a \u2018dual-track pricing system\u2019. That\nsystem disappeared around the time the Fourteenth Congress, held in 1992,\ndeclared China a \u2018socialist market economy\u2019. The allocation mechanism for\ngoods, services, labour and capital became, by default, the market. China has\nunambiguously been a market economy for three decades now, and it is on this\nbasis that Chinese enterprises operate.\n\nFar from the mayor economy running up against the market economy, the market\neconomy is its foundation. Statism operates via the market. When, in April\n2020, the Hefei government directed an investment fund under its control to\npurchase a minority stake in Nio, this was carried out as a financial\ntransaction between two corporate entities. When the timing was right, the\ncity cashed out of some of its shareholding. The market \u2013 or rather, the\nfinancial markets \u2013 acted as a conduit for state influence over the economy.\n\nFor decades now, the CCP has focused its efforts on shaping, rather than\nreplacing, the market economy. Western commentators often characterise this\neconomic paradigm as a matter of \u2018regime survival\u2019: in order to escape the\nfate of the Eastern Bloc, China\u2019s leaders harness strategic resources, co-\nopting supporters and denying access to potential opponents, while creating\nthe economic growth necessary to mollify the broader population. But this\ninterpretation can hardly account for what\u2019s happening in Hefei.\n\nJin sidesteps the \u2018regime survival\u2019 thesis. Instead, she offers two\nalternative explanations. \u2018In China,\u2019 she writes, \u2018an interventionist state is\nrooted in paternalism, a hallmark of government in China since Confucian times\n... it is based on the conviction that intervention by a senior person is\njustified if it benefits a junior person.\u2019 Like an authoritarian parent (the\n\u2018Tiger Mom\u2019 gets a mention), the Chinese Communist Party believes it should\nclamp down on inappropriate behaviour in economic life in the name of\nindividual morality as well as collective stability. Confucianism aside, Jin\nargues that the government is well placed to correct China\u2019s \u2018weak\ninstitutions\u2019, by which she means a less robust legal system than in Western\ncountries and a \u2018primitive financial system\u2019 unable to match the\nsophistication of US capital markets. \u2018A powerful state,\u2019 she argues, \u2018is\nespecially effective in an economy\u2019s infancy, when market institutions are\nstill a work in progress.\u2019 This is a line of reasoning familiar to students of\northodox institutional economics; even neoclassical doctrinaires will accept\nthat government intervention can be called on to address market failures and\n\u2018institutional flaws and loopholes\u2019.\n\nWhile there may be a measure of truth in this account, there is another\nexplanation for economic statism in today\u2019s China. It has to do with the self-\npropelling dynamic of capital accumulation. The most recent data from China\u2019s\nNational Bureau of Statistics put the number of state-controlled enterprises\nat 362,000 in 2022 (up from 227,000 in 2013). A recent study cited in Jin\u2019s\nwork, led by an economist at Tsinghua University, estimated that there are\nalso more than a hundred thousand privately owned enterprises that have\nminority equity investments from the state. Only a tiny fraction of state-\nconnected firms in China have a direct link to the central government in\nBeijing. The more typical arrangement involves degrees of separation at a sub-\nnational level: a medium-sized firm based in a prefecture-level city, say,\ncould be the subsidiary of another firm, which could in turn be partly owned\nby a city-controlled investment vehicle.\n\nThe directive to accumulate capital for the state is reflected in the\nguidelines produced by the central government\u2019s State-owned Assets Supervision\nand Administration Commission (SASAC) which detail how to manage state-owned\ncorporate assets and advocate completing the transition from the old statist\nmethod of \u2018managing enterprises\u2019 to the new one of \u2018managing capital\u2019. The\nphrase \u2018managing capital\u2019 implies that government bureaus overseeing state-\ninvested firms should not take direct charge of business operations. Instead,\nthey should assume the role of an asset manager overseeing a portfolio of\ncorporate investments and focus on expanding the value of the capital under\ntheir watch. Since its creation two decades ago, SASAC has been pushing the\n\u2018rate of preservation and growth of state-owned capital\u2019 as a central\nperformance metric in the state sector. In the Chinese system, state-owned\ncapital may be sustaining its own expansionary momentum.\n\nJin accepts as given a significant change in the Chinese economic system since\nXi Jinping came to power in 2012. Students of Chinese economic policy have\ncertainly witnessed their fair share of declarations about things being \u2018new\u2019\nin the last twelve years. We have seen the advent of the \u2018new normal\u2019 (\u65b0\u5e38\u6001),\nthe \u2018new era\u2019 (\u65b0\u65f6\u4ee3), the \u2018new type of whole-state system for breakthroughs in\ncore technologies\u2019 (\u5173\u952e\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\u653b\u5173\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u4e3e\u56fd\u4f53\u5236) and, more recently, the \u2018new development\npattern\u2019 (\u65b0\u53d1\u5c55\u683c\u5c40) in tandem with the \u2018new security pattern\u2019 (\u65b0\u5b89\u5168\u683c\u5c40). Taken\ntogether, these reflect a gradual reordering of priorities: from export and\ninvestment-driven growth to a slower growth rate increasingly driven by\ninnovation and consumption. At the same time, a heightened emphasis on\nnational security under Xi, coupled with the expanding sanctions and export\ncontrols imposed by the Trump and Biden administrations, has produced an\nunprecedented emphasis on technological self-reliance in critical areas such\nas semiconductors.\n\nJin\u2019s claim that there is a \u2018new playbook\u2019 might be overstated, but it\u2019s true\nenough that there is an upgraded economic strategy. At the same time, the\nunderlying structures of the PRC economy have never felt so stable, or so\nconsolidated, as during the last two decades. In the 1980s, Deng Xiaoping\noversaw the end of collective agriculture, the emergence of small private\nbusinesses, the rapid growth of market exchange for goods and services\nalongside central planning and the introduction of foreign investment. In the\n1990s, government-mandated prices were phased out; large-scale private\ncompanies entered the scene; the fiscal, monetary and financial systems were\noverhauled; and the entire public sector was dramatically restructured, with\nthe loss of millions of jobs. The last two decades have seen nothing like the\nstructural transformations of those years. For all the talk of \u2018rebalancing\u2019\nChina\u2019s economy, relative levels of investment and consumption have remained\nsteady since the mid-2000s. The contributions of the public and private\nsectors to economic activity have also been stable, if with an increased\nintermingling as a result of minority shareholding. Any significant\nbreakthrough, whether planned or unforeseen, will occur in the context of an\nensconced economic system.\n\nShare on TwitterShare on FacebookEmailPrintLetters\n\nSend Letters To:\n\nThe Editor London Review of Books, 28 Little Russell Street London, WC1A 2HN\n\nletters@lrb.co.uk\n\nPlease include name, address, and a telephone number.\n\n### Nathan Sperber\n\nNathan Sperber is a researcher in political economy.\n\n### send letters to\n\nThe Editor London Review of Books 28 Little Russell Street London, WC1A 2HN\n\nletters@lrb.co.uk\n\nPlease include name, address and a telephone number\n\n### Download the LRB app\n\nRead anywhere with the London Review of Books app, available now from the App\nStore for Apple devices, Google Play for Android devices and Amazon for your\nKindle Fire.\n\nFind out more about the London Review of Books app\n\n### Sign up to our newsletter\n\nFor highlights from the latest issue, our archive and the blog, as well as\nnews, events and exclusive promotions.\n\nNewsletter Preferences\n\n### About\n\n  * About the LRB\n  * Subscribe\n  * Publication schedule\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Bookshop\n  * Jobs\n\n### Help\n\n  * Contact us\n  * The LRB app\n  * For librarians\n  * Accessibility\n  * FAQs\n\n### Follow Us\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n\nLondon Review of Books\n\n\u00a9 LRB (London) Ltd 1980 - 2024.
