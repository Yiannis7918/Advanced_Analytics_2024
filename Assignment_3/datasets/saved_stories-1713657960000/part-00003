This seems insufficient from any\nperspective.\n\n#### German Tebiev\n\nApr 19, 2024 \u2014 2 min read\n\nThe preface to \u201cThe Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right\u201d by surgeon\nAtul Gawande [1] contains a reference to the article \u201cToward a theory of\nmedical fallibility\u201d by philosophers Samuel Gorovitz and Alasdair MacIntyre\n[2]. This article says that it is required to see all scientific mistakes as\ncaused by only two reasons:\n\n> What matters for our subsequent argument is that this understanding of the\n> norms of natural science involves acceptance of one particular way of\n> classifying scientific errors. For on this view all scientific error will\n> arise either from the limitations of the present state of natural science \u2014\n> i.e. ignorance \u2014 or from the willfulness of negligence of the natural\n> scientist \u2014 i.e. ineptitude. This classification is treated as exhaustive.\n\nOn the other hand, the book expands the view on errors. Now these are not only\nscientific errors, but any errors. Here is a quote describing their types:\n\n> The first is ignorance \u2014 we may err because science has given us only a\n> partial understanding of the world and how it works. There are skyscrapers\n> we do not yet know how to build, snowstorms we cannot predict, heart attacks\n> we still haven\u2019t learned how to stop. The second type of failure the\n> philosophers call ineptitude \u2014 because in these instances the knowledge\n> exists, yet we fail to apply it correctly. This is the skyscraper that is\n> built wrong and collapses, the snowstorm whose signs the meteorologist just\n> plain missed, the stab wound from a weapon the doctors forgot to ask about.\n\nWas it the first time I read it, or even today I can\u2019t understand how it was\npossible to exclude all other sources of errors? Even if you have knowledge\nand have the opportunity to apply it correctly, you can simply get tired or\ndistracted. You can refuse to use knowledge due to pressure due to\ncircumstances or lack of desire. You can fall under the influence of various\ndistortions, which Daniel Kahneman and his colleagues described extensively in\ntheir books \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow\u201d [3] and \u201cNoise\u201d [4]. There are plenty of\nopportunities to make mistakes, far more than ignorance or ineptitude.\n\nWhat I agree with from the preface is that the complexity of human activity\nhas increased significantly. I also agree that the first appropriate strategy\nfor dealing with complexity is a checklist.\n\nList of links: [1] Atul Gawande \u201cThe Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things\nRight\u201d, ISBN 978-0312430009 [2] \u201cToward a theory of medical fallibility\u201d by\nSamuel Gorovitz and Alasdair MacIntyre [3] Daniel Kahneman \u201cThinking, Fast and\nSlow\u201d, ISBN 978-0374533557 [4] Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony, Cass R.\nSunstein, \u201cNoise: A Flaw in Human Judgment\u201d, ISBN 978-0316451390\n\n## Read more\n\n### Why is it difficult to introduce checklists into the daily activities of\nan organization?\n\nChecklists provide benefits for quality and consistency in the organization.\nHowever, people tend to dislike them. Reflections on the phenomenon.\n\nBy German Tebiev Apr 16, 2024\n\n### Pilots did not invent checklists in 1935. When did they appear?\n\nThe entire visible Internet unanimously declares that the checklists appeared\nafter the crash of the \u201cModel 299\u201d military aircraft. This article shows that\nthis is completely wrong, and the history of checklists is much more\ninteresting.\n\nBy German Tebiev Apr 12, 2024\n\n### Books about lists\n\nThere are books on many topics, and there are books about lists. Are they as\nusual as the topic itself? No, quite the opposite!\n\nBy German Tebiev Apr 9, 2024\n\n### Is there anything more primary than a list?\n\nIt seems that a list is such an elementary thing that there is nothing to\nappear before it. Maybe just a list item. However, there is something quite\nsignificant that precedes a list. The lists discussed here are the tools, and\neach tool has a purpose.
