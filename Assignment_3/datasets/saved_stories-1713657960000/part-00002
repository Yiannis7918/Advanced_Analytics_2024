Intended as a defensive missile for the B-70 Valkyrie\nMach 3 bomber, the program saw extensive wind-tunnel testing and seemed\npromising; however, the cancellation of the B-70 removed the requirement for\nthe missile, and the project was cancelled.\n\n## Genesis[edit]\n\nProject \"Pye Wacket\", officially known as the Lenticular Defense Missile (LDM)\nProgram and by the project number WS-740A,^[2] was instituted in 1958 in\nresponse to a US Air Force request for a Defensive Anti-Missile System (DAMS)\nto protect the proposed B-70 Valkyrie strategic bomber from high-speed, high-\naltitude surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and interceptor aircraft.^[3]\n\nThe extreme speed and operating altitude of the Valkyrie was considered\nsufficient protection against Soviet interceptors of the time.^[4] However it\nwas anticipated that future aircraft and missile developments would reduce the\nB-70's margin of superiority,^[3] especially following the SA-2 Guideline SAM\nbeing displayed during the 1957 May Day parade.^[5] Intelligence reports\nindicated that SAMs were being deployed in large numbers throughout\nRussia,^[6] and it was believed the SA-2 was capable of being fitted with a\nnuclear warhead.^[7] Therefore, it was decided that the B-70 would need an\ninterceptor missile to defend itself against the perceived threat.^[3]\n\n## Design[edit]\n\nMain structure weldment of the Pye Wacket, as shown in the Feasibility Test\nVehicle Study prepared by General Dynamics Corporation for U.S. Air Force\nSystems Command in 1961\n\nThe specifications for the proposed DAMS called for an air-launched defensive\nmissile, capable of engaging incoming missiles at relative speeds of up to\nMach 7,^[3] surviving a rate of acceleration between 60 g to 250 g, and being\nable to undertake rapid terminal-phase guidance changes in any direction.^[8]\n\nFollowing initial studies and wind-tunnel testing at the Air Proving Ground\nCenter and Arnold Engineering Development Center,^[3] a radically\nunconventional design emerged that featured a lenticular, wedge-shaped\nairframe.^[3] The lenticular design was considered to have the best handling\ncharacteristics at extremely high angles of attack, and would theoretically\npossess ideal mass distribution, giving the missile outstanding terminal\nagility.^[3] In addition, the lenticular design allowed for omnidirectional\nlaunching from the carrying aircraft.^[2]\n\nFollowing the feasibility studies, a contract for the development of the DAMS\ndesign was awarded to the Convair division of the General Dynamics Corporation\nin Pomona, California in 1959.^[3]^[9] Wind tunnel testing of several options\nfor control of the missile resulted in an arrangement of six small rocket\nthrusters being selected for reaction control.^[3] The airframe of the missile\nwas constructed of magnesium alloy, and main power would be provided by three\nThiokol M58A2 solid-fuel rockets.^[3]\n\n## Cancellation[edit]\n\nPye Wacket was planned to be tested using a rocket sled launcher,^[3] with a\nMach 5 booster rocket being used later in the test program.^[2] There are\nunconfirmed reports that some tests were conducted in 1960.^[3] However the\nhigh cost and perceived vulnerability of the B-70 against the projected\nperformance of Soviet air defenses,^[10] combined with the 1960 U-2 incident\nin which a high-flying spyplane had been shot down, led to the decision that\nintercontinental ballistic missiles would, in the future, be the primary\nnuclear delivery force of the United States, and therefore the B-70 project\nwas cancelled in early 1961.^[11] Pye Wacket, its delivery vehicle no longer\navailable, is believed to have been cancelled soon after,^[3] although the\nultimate fate of the program remains classified.^[2]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Flying saucer\n  * Lenticular Reentry Vehicle\n\n## References[edit]\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Article title (a document from ARMED SERVICES TECHNICAL INFORMATION AGENCY)\n  2. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d USAF 1961.\n  3. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g ^h ^i ^j ^k ^l ^m Parsch 2005\n  4. ^ Rees 1960, p.125.\n  5. ^ Hannah 2001, p.68.\n  6. ^ Crabtree 1994, p.107.\n  7. ^ Cochran et al. 1989, p.32.\n  8. ^ General Dynamics 1961.\n  9. ^ Article title Archived 2012-02-16 at the Wayback Machine Pye Wacket: Feasibility Test Vehicle Study.
