The research explores how rhythmic electrical fields,\ngenerated by neurons, influence and align neighboring neurons, enhancing\ncognitive function.\n\nThis approach provides a bridge between the microscale of neuron spikes and\nthe macroscale of brain-wide coordination, suggesting that brain rhythms play\na crucial role in organizing and processing information. The study argues that\nunderstanding these dynamics is vital for developing treatments for\nneurological disorders and advancing our comprehension of cognitive processes.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n  1. The study highlights the role of \u201cephaptic coupling\u201d where an electric field influences nearby neurons, fostering neural alignment and synchrony.\n  2. The research suggests that lower-frequency \u201cbeta\u201d rhythms regulate higher-frequency \u201cgamma\u201d rhythms, affecting how sensory information is encoded and retrieved.\n  3. Insights from the study could lead to improved interventions for conditions like schizophrenia and epilepsy by targeting disruptions in neural synchrony.\n\nSource: MIT\n\nIt could be very informative to observe the pixels on your phone under a\nmicroscope, but not if your goal is to understand what a whole video on the\nscreen shows. Cognition is much the same kind of emergent property in the\nbrain. It can only be understood by observing how millions of cells act in\ncoordination, argues a trio of MIT neuroscientists. In a new article, they lay\nout a framework for understanding how thought arises from the coordination of\nneural activity driven by oscillating electric fields\u2014also known as brain\n\u201cwaves\u201d or \u201crhythms.\u201d\n\nHistorically dismissed solely as byproducts of neural activity, brain rhythms\nare actually critical for organizing it, write Picower Professor Earl Miller\nand research scientists Scott Brincat and Jefferson Roy in Current Opinion in\nBehavioral Science. And while neuroscientists have gained tremendous knowledge\nfrom studying how individual brain cells connect and how and when they emit\n\u201cspikes\u201d to send impulses through specific circuits, there is also a need to\nappreciate and apply new concepts at the brain rhythm scale, which can span\nindividual, or even multiple, brain regions.\n\n\u201cSpiking and anatomy are important but there is more going on in the brain\nabove and beyond that,\u201d said senior author Miller, a faculty member in The\nPicower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Department of Brain and\nCognitive Sciences at MIT. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of functionality taking place\nat a higher level, especially cognition.\u201d\n\nThe stakes of studying the brain at that scale, the authors write, might not\nonly include understanding healthy higher-level function but also how those\nfunctions become disrupted in disease.\n\n\u201cMany neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, epilepsy\nand Parkinson\u2019s involve disruption of emergent properties like neural\nsynchrony,\u201d they write. \u201cWe anticipate that understanding how to interpret and\ninterface with these emergent properties will be critical for developing\neffective treatments as well as understanding cognition.\u201d\n\nThe emergence of thoughts\n\nThe bridge between the scale of individual neurons and the broader-scale\ncoordination of many cells is founded on electric fields, the researchers\nwrite.\n\nVia a phenomenon called \u201cephaptic coupling,\u201d the electrical field generated by\nthe activity of a neuron can influence the voltage of neighboring neurons,\ncreating an alignment among them. In this way, electric fields both reflect\nneural activity but also influence it.\n\nIn a paper in 2022, Miller and colleagues showed via experiments and\ncomputational modeling that the information encoded in the electric fields\ngenerated by ensembles of neurons can be read out more reliably than the\ninformation encoded by the spikes of individual cells.\n\n\u201cThus the organization of neural responses into subspaces can both segregate\nand integrate information,\u201d the authors write.

It is as if the spiking of neurons is like a flock of birds\ncoordinating their movements.\n\nDifferent phases and frequencies of brain rhythms provide this coordination,\naligned to amplify each other, or offset to prevent interference. For\ninstance, if a piece of sensory information needs to be remembered, neural\nactivity representing it can be protected from interference when new sensory\ninformation is perceived.\n\n\u201cThus the organization of neural responses into subspaces can both segregate\nand integrate information,\u201d the authors write.\n\nThe power of brain rhythms to coordinate and organize information processing\nin the brain is what enables functional cognition to emerge at that scale, the\nauthors write. Understanding cognition in the brain, therefore, requires\nstudying rhythms.\n\n\u201cStudying individual neural components in isolation\u2014individual neurons and\nsynapses\u2014has made enormous contributions to our understanding of the brain and\nremains important,\u201d the authors conclude.\n\n\u201cHowever, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that, to fully capture the brain\u2019s\ncomplexity, those components must be analyzed in concert to identify, study,\nand relate their emergent properties.\u201d\n\n## About this cognition and neuroscience research news\n\nAuthor: David Orenstein Source: MIT Contact: David Orenstein \u2013 MIT Image: The\nimage is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Open access. \u201cCognition is an emergent property\u201d by Earl\nMiller et al.
