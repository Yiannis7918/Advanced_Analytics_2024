What ideas you have. What you want to learn next. What\nyou don't know yet. And how you can learn that in most optimal way possible\ngiven what you know already.\n\nTry website yourself first to get feel for it.\n\nIt is fully open source project with active community on Discord. There is\ngreat focus on both DX of developing everything LA and even more, end user UX.\n\n#### Contents\n\n  * Files\n  * Setup\n  * Run GraphQL server (Grafbase)\n  * Run website (Solid)\n  * Contribute\n  * Docs\n  * Design\n  * Tasks / Explore\n  * Commands\n\n## Files\n\n  * api - Grafbase GraphQL API layer + EdgeDB\n  * app - desktop app built with Tauri/Solid\n  * cli - clis for internal/external use\n  * shared - shared TS functions (can be used by any part of monorepo)\n  * website - learn-anything.xyz website code in Solid\n\n## Setup\n\nPNPM is used to manage dependencies. Bun is used to run things.\n\n    \n    \n    pnpm i bun setup\n\nbun setup runs bun cmd.ts setup (see cmd.ts code for what it does). In short\nit will setup the project ready for development with all the deps, .env files\nnecessary. Together with working EdgeDB database. Just follow instructions in\nthe setup script.\n\nAll next actions assume bun setup was done correctly, you will receive Setup\ncompleted after bun setup completes succesfully.\n\nAll commands you can run are seen here. Below goes over important ones.\n\nWarning\n\nIf you get any problems with setup, reach out on Discord\n\n## Run GraphQL server (Grafbase)\n\n    \n    \n    bun grafbase\n\nThen open http://localhost:4000 either in browser or Pathfinder.\n\n## Run website (Solid)\n\n    \n    \n    bun web\n\nThen open http://localhost:3000 in browser.\n\n## Contribute\n\nAlways open to useful ideas or fixes in form of issues or PRs.\n\nCurrent issues are organised with labels. Issues currently in focus are\nlabeled with Current Month label.\n\nIf issue is not already present (do search first), open new issue, start\ndiscussion or ask about it on Discord.\n\nIt's okay to submit draft PR as you can get help along the way to make it\nmerge ready.\n\nAny issues with setup or making your first feature or trying to fix a bug will\nbe resolved asap. Same goes for discussing ideas on how to make the tool even\nbetter than it is now.\n\n## Docs\n\nAll docs can be seen in docs.learn-anything.xyz.\n\nIt is advisable you read them, before you start developing anything as they\nprovide a lot of context and general knowledge.\n\nThere is big focus on documentation and clarity in the project. All code\nshould be clear and understandable and well documented.\n\nCheck Dev Tips for some advice on development together with tech stack\nexplanation.\n\n## Design\n\nAll design is done in Figma and FigJam.\n\nIf you're designer and want to help out or have ideas, mention it on Discord's\n#design channel.\n\n## Tasks / Explore\n\nThere is separate repo of tasks with goal to take the tasks used in LA and\ngeneralise it for use by community.\n\nTogether with explore for prototyping of various kind.\n\n## Commands\n\n### bun setup\n\n> bun cmd.ts setup\n\nFully sets up LA for development (website, desktop, mobile, api, ..).\n\n### bun web\n\n> cd website && bun dev\n\nRun website.\n\n### bun app\n\n> cd app && bun tauri:dev\n\nRun desktop app built with Tauri.\n\n### bun cli\n\n> cd api/edgedb && bun --watch ../../cli/cli.ts\n\nRun CLI to quickly execute TS code (run queries and more..).\n\n### bun db:ui\n\n> cd grafbase/edgedb && edgedb ui\n\nOpen EdgeDB UI to run queries and more.\n\n### bun grafbase\n\n> bun cmd.ts grafbase\n\nRun Grafbase in development mode.\n\n### bun graphql\n\n> bun cmd.ts graphql\n\nGenerate queries for GQL client.\n\n### bun cmd\n\n> bun --watch cmd.ts\n\nRun command in cmd.ts\n\n### bun ios\n\n> cd mobile && pnpm run ios\n\nRun mobile app with Expo.\n\n### \ud83d\udda4\n\n## About\n\nOrganize world's knowledge, explore connections and curate learning paths\n\nlearn-anything.xyz\n\n### Topics\n\ngraphql rust solid tauri edgedb grafbase\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nMIT license\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n15.6k stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n431 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n958 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Sponsor this project\n\nnikitavoloboev Nikita\n\nSponsor\n\nLearn more about GitHub Sponsors\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 12\n\n## Languages\n\n  * TypeScript 77.8%\n  * EdgeQL 13.0%\n  * JavaScript 7.9%\n  * Other 1.3%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
