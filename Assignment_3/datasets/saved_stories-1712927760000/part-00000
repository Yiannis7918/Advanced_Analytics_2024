'Dash\nWar') was the political conflict over what to call the country of\nCzechoslovakia after the fall of the Communist government in 1989.\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nThe official name of the country during the last 30 years of Communist rule\nwas \"Czechoslovak Socialist Republic\" (in Czech and in Slovak \u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1\nsocialistick\u00e1 republika, or \u010cSSR). In December 1989\u2014a month after the Velvet\nRevolution\u2014President V\u00e1clav Havel announced that the word \"Socialist\" would be\ndropped from the country's official name. Conventional wisdom suggested that\nit would be known as simply the \"Czechoslovak Republic\", which was its\nofficial name from 1920 to 1938 and again during the Third Czechoslovak\nRepublic and early years of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (1945\u20131960).\n\nHowever, Slovak politicians felt this diminished Slovakia's equal stature, and\ndemanded that the country's name be spelled with a hyphen (i.e. \"Czecho-Slovak\nRepublic\"), as it was spelled from independence in 1918 until 1920, and again\nduring the Second Czechoslovak Republic (1938\u20131939). President Havel then\nchanged his proposal to \"Republic of Czecho-Slovakia\"\u2014a proposal that did not\nsit well with Czech politicians who saw reminders of the 1938 Munich\nAgreement, in which Nazi Germany annexed a part of that\nterritory.^[clarification needed]^[citation needed]\n\n## Resolution[edit]\n\nAs a compromise, on 29 March 1990 the Czechoslovak parliament resolved that\nthe country's long name was to be the \"Czechoslovak Federative Republic,\"\nexplicitly acknowledging that the country was a federation. The name was to be\nspelled without a hyphen in Czech (\u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 federativn\u00ed republika), but\nwith a hyphen in Slovak (\u010cesko-slovensk\u00e1 federat\u00edvna republika).^[1]^[2]^[3]\nAn informal agreement on the Slovak long-form name was to be codified in a\nfuture law on state symbols.^[citation needed]\n\nThis solution was found to be unsatisfactory, and less than a month later, on\n20 April 1990, the parliament changed the name again, to the \"Czech and Slovak\nFederative Republic\" (Czech: \u010cesk\u00e1 a Slovensk\u00e1 Federativn\u00ed Republika, Slovak:\n\u010cesk\u00e1 a Slovensk\u00e1 Federat\u00edvna Republika, or \u010cSFR). This law explicitly listed\nthe long-form names in both languages and stated they were equal.^[4]^[5]^[6]\n\nGenerally, only the first word of a country's name is capitalized in Czech and\nSlovak. Capitalizing all of the words eliminated issues of prestige around the\ncapitalization of \"Slovensk\u00e1\".\n\nAlthough the Slovaks were demanding a hyphen (Czech, Slovak: spojovn\u00edk), the\nCzechs called it a dash (Czech, Slovak: poml\u010dka). Although there is a clear\ndifference between a hyphen and a dash in Czech and Slovak spelling (a hyphen\nis used to mark a connection between two words, while a dash is used in other\ncases), both Czechs and Slovaks usually use the term poml\u010dka for\nboth.^[citation needed] Nonetheless, English language media generally refer to\nthe conflict as the \"Hyphen War\".^[citation needed]\n\nWhile the Hyphen War was not really deserving of the name \"war\", it\ndemonstrated that there were differences between Czechs and Slovaks regarding\nthe identity of their shared country. Over the following two years, more\nsubstantial disputes arose between the two halves of the federation. In 1992,\nCzech and Slovak politicians agreed to split the country into the two states\nof the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic\u2014the so-called Velvet Divorce\u2014which\nbecame effective on 1 January 1993.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Name of the Czech Republic\n  * Dissolution of Czechoslovakia\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Sb\u00edrka z\u00e1kon\u016f * \u010cesk\u00e9 a Slovensk\u00e9 federativn\u00ed republiky * \u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 federativn\u00ed republika * \u010cesk\u00e9 republiky / Slovensk\u00e9 republiky|archiv stranek MVCR.cz, cerven 2008\".
