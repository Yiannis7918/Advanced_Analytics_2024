Indeed, problems with\nthe eyes can be one of the earliest signs of cognitive decline. Our latest\nstudy shows that a loss of visual sensitivity can predict dementia 12 years\nbefore it is diagnosed.\n\nOur research was based on 8,623 healthy people in Norfolk, England, who were\nfollowed up for many years. By the end of the study, 537 participants had\ndeveloped dementia, so we could see what factors might have preceded this\ndiagnosis.\n\nAt the start of the study, we asked participants to take a visual sensitivity\ntest. For the test, they had to press a button as soon as they saw a triangle\nforming in a field of moving dots. People who would develop dementia were much\nslower to see this triangle on the screen than people who would remain without\ndementia.\n\nSo why might that be?\n\nVisual issues may be an early indicator of cognitive decline as the toxic\namyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease may first affect areas of\nthe brain associated with vision, with parts of the brain associated with\nmemory becoming damaged as the disease progresses. So vision tests may find\ndeficits before memory tests do.\n\nThere are several other aspects of visual processing that are affected in\nAlzheimer's disease, such as the ability to see outlines of objects (contrast\nsensitivity) and to discern between certain colours (the ability to see the\nblue-green spectrum is affected early in dementia), and these can affect\npeople's lives without them being immediately aware it.\n\nAnother early sign of Alzheimer's is a deficit in the \"inhibitory control\" of\neye movements, where distracting stimuli seem to hold attention more readily.\nPeople with Alzheimer's seem to have an issue ignoring distracting stimuli,\nwhich may show up as eye-movement-control issues.\n\nIf dementia makes it harder to avoid distracting stimuli, then these problems\ncould increase the risk of driving accidents \u2013 something we are currently\ninvestigating at Loughborough University.\n\n## Recognising faces\n\nWe have some evidence which suggests that people with dementia tend to process\nnew people's faces inefficiently. In other words, they don't follow the usual\npattern of scanning the face of the person they are talking to.\n\nIn healthy people, this would be from eyes to nose to mouth. We do this to\n\"imprint\" the face and remember it for later. People can sometimes sense when\nthe person they are talking to does not do this.\n\nIn fact, some doctors working with people with dementia will recognise that\nsomeone has dementia when they meet them. People with dementia can sometimes\nseem lost, because they do not purposefully move their eyes to scan the\nenvironment, including that of the face of the people they have just met.\n\nIt would follow that you would then later be less able to recognise people as\nyou have not imprinted their features. So this early issue in not recognising\npeople you have just met could be related to ineffective eye movement for new\nfaces, rather than being a pure memory disorder.\n\n## Can eye movement improve memory?\n\nHowever, as visual sensitivity is related to memory performance (even using\nnon-visual tests), we are also testing whether getting people to do more eye\nmovements helps to improve memory. Previous research on the matter is mixed,\nbut some studies found that eye movement can improve memory. Perhaps that\nexplains why we found that people who watch more TV and read more have better\nmemory and less dementia risk than those who do not.\n\nWhile watching TV or reading, our eyes flick back and forth over the page and\nTV screen. However, people who read often also tend to have been in education\nlonger. Having had good education provides brain reserve capacity so that when\nconnections in the brain are damaged, the negative result is less.\n\nIn other studies, eye movements from left to right and right to left done\nquickly (two eye movements per second) were found to improve autobiographical\nmemory (your life story). However, some studies suggest this beneficial effect\nof eye movement only benefits right-handed people. We are not sure why this\nis.\n\nDespite these exciting findings, treatment for memory problems using\ndeliberate eye movements in older people has not been done that much yet.\nAlso, using deficits in eye movements as a diagnostic is not a regular\nfeature, despite the possibilities in eye movement technology.\n\nOne of the bottlenecks may be access to eye-tracking technologies, which are\nexpensive and require training to use and analyse. Until cheaper and easy-to-\nuse eye trackers are available, using eye movements as a diagnostic tool for\nearly-stage Alzheimer's is not possible outside the laboratory.\n\nEef Hogervorst, Professor of Biological Psychology, Loughborough University;\nAhmet Begde, PhD Candidate, Neurorehabilitation, Loughborough University, and\nThom Wilcockson, Senior Lecturer in Psychology, Loughborough University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons\nlicense.
