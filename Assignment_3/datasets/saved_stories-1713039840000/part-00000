H2C is now tasked with\nsingle-shell tank retrieval and closure and the design, construction, and\noperation of waste facilities, according to the DOE.\n\nEnvironmental health and safety are paramount to those aims, and security and\nemergency services are also part of the H2C's responsibilities. Water\ncontamination, whether through plastic pollution or hazardous waste, is known\nto have a wide range of harmful impacts on local ecosystems and human health.\n\nThe Hanford site partially feeds into the Columbia River, whose basin goes\nthrough seven U.S. states, providing irrigation for crops, drinking water for\nmultiple communities, and serving as home to millions of salmon \u2014 a vital food\nsource that is also being negatively impacted by changing global temperatures\ndriven by human-made pollution.\n\nAccording to Washington's Department of Ecology, significant progress has been\nmade in cleaning up the Hanford Site, but roughly \"60 square miles of\ngroundwater remains contaminated above federal standards.\"\n\nAs part of its contract, H2C will turn much of the remaining hazardous waste\ninto glass for \"permanent disposal,\" as reported by the Tri-City Herald for\nThe Daily News. The Herald added that a 120-day transition period is in place\nas H2C takes over from Washington River Protection Solutions, which had been\nleading cleanup efforts on short-term contracts since 2008.\n\n\"Amentum and our partners have a tremendous track record of treating waste and\nmanaging nuclear operations around the DOE complex,\" Amentum National Security\nGroup president Mark Whitney told the outlet. \"We will bring the most advanced\ntechnologies and experienced team to help solve one of our nation's most\nimportant environmental challenges.\"\n\nSome might be eager for H2C to spearhead the cleanup, but it appears things\nare tied up in court for the time being. At the end of March, HTDA filed a\nsecond appeal with the aim of securing the 10-year contract, per Washington\nTechnology.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for cool news and actionable info that makes it easy\nto help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n  * share\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Link Copied!\n\n## Cool Picks\n\n#### This startup helps you save money on your utility bills by switching to\nsolar power \u2014 no rooftop panels necessary\n\n#### Here's how to lower your energy bills in a single click \u2014 without getting\nscammed by electricity companies\n\n#### Here's a simple way to turn your old sneakers into actual cash: 'I can\ntell you firsthand \u2014 it works'\n\n#### This new law is like a free '$8,000 bank account' for remodeling your\nhome \u2014 here's how to take advantage of it\n\n  * ABOUT\n  * PRIVACY\n  * TERMS\n  * CONTACT\n\n#### Follow Us\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n\n\u00a9 2024 THE COOL DOWN COMPANY.
