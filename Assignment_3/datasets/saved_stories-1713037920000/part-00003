Now twenty years later, we are\nproud to present to you: release 14.0.\n\nAnd boy, what a release it is. Do I dare to say: this has been the biggest\nrelease yet?\n\nSometimes people try to tell us OpenTTD is dead. Well, 14.0 shows you it\nreally isn\u2019t. There are so many new goodies in 14.0, that I don\u2019t even know\nwhere to start! Let\u2019s go over a few, just to get you a feel for what to expect\nwhen you launch OpenTTD 14.0.\n\nRead more about our birthday celebration here.\n\n## When one day isn\u2019t a day\n\nIt is now possible to make the calendar time walk slower, up to a point it is\nfrozen. This doesn\u2019t influence vehicle movement at all, nor the amount of\ngoods transported, town growth, etc. But it does influence vehicle\nintroduction dates, inflation, and aging.\n\nWith this feature, we hope to enable different game-plays, where people want\nto have more time to build out their empire before vehicles expire, inflation\ngets too big, etc.\n\nA brand new day! For some a bit slower than others.\n\nRead more about this new feature in the devblog.\n\n## Ship Pathfinder\n\nThe ship pathfinder got some great love. It is now capable of directing ships\nover vast distances without the need for buoys. In fact, one could say, you\ndon\u2019t need buoys anymore at all. The ships will still find their way!\n\nFinally, no more \u201cShip is lost\u201d non-sense. This enables ship-only games.\n\nRead more about this new feature in the devblog.\n\n## Unbunching\n\nDo you also hate when busses start hugging each other on a route? And you did\nyour best to ensure you send them out the depot with a good distance between\nthem. But something must have happened down the road, and now they are very\nclose to each other!\n\nIntroducing: unbunching.\n\nA new feature that allows you to tell all vehicles in a shared order pool to\nkeep their distance; automatically, done for you.\n\nRead more about this new feature in the devblog.\n\n## Social Platform integration\n\nOpenTTD 14.0 allows better integration with Social Platforms. This is totally\noptional, and has to be installed separately. But once done, OpenTTD can talk\nto platforms like Steam, Discord and GOG Galaxy.\n\nFor now, the functionality is limited: friends can see you play OpenTTD, if\nyou are in a server or not, and what kind of map you are playing. For future\nversions, we intend to expand on that, making more possible. But, small steps.\n\nRead more about this new feature in the devblog.\n\n## Survey support\n\nTo finally put a rest to endless debates about what setting is used and which\nis not, OpenTTD now has an opt-in survey tool built-in. Over time this will\nallow us, developers, to better understand how OpenTTD is played, so we can\nbetter anticipate what will be a hit or a miss.\n\nYou can, at any time, opt in or out from the survey.\n\nRead more about this new feature in the devblog\n\n## GUI improvements / scalable font\n\nThere has been a huge effort in making all our windows just a tiny bit better.\nFixing pixel-errors, moving things around a bit, fixing colouring issues.\n\nBut .. not less important, we now also have a built-in scalable font! Zephyris\ncreated a real (TTF) font heavily inspired by the sprite font. This means that\nscaling looks a lot better, especially for zoom levels like 1.5x.\n\nWe love it so much, it is the default when you launch the game! (but no\nworries, you can revert to the sprite font if you really want to).\n\nRead more about this new feature in the devblog.\n\n## New players experience\n\nFirst of all, there is now a Help and Manuals button in-game, that helps you\nthrough the basic information of the game. Bringing information closer to the\nuser, and the game more accessible to everyone, has been a path we have been\non for a while.\n\nSecond, we revised a lot of settings, what their default value should be. Many\nsettings have had their defaults changed, mostly towards enabling modern\nfeatures by default.\n\nLastly, we also renamed Cheats to Sandbox. We noticed people were struggling\nwith using \u201ccheats\u201d, as we have been conditioned that cheats in games are bad.\nBut Cheats in OpenTTD context is much more \u201cplay how you like\u201d (read:\nSandbox). So we renamed it, hopefully making it more clear to new players that\nit is perfectly okay to use these Sandbox options any time they like.\n\nHopefully this helps new players get into the game easier.\n\n## So much more ...\n\nIn total OpenTTD 14.0 comes with roughly 40 new features, over 500 bug-fixes,\n200 changes, and many many code improvements.\n\nIt took us 2,000 commits to get from 13.4 to 14.0, we touched 140,000 lines of\ncode and removed 74,000 of them. This was all done by over 60 contributors.\n\nInterested how this all came together? Check out our blog post explaining it\nall.\n\nA great thank you to all who contributed, with code or support; it is truly\nappreciated!
