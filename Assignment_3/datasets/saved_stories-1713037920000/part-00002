We just learned that paying enterprise users\nhas grown from 150,000 to 600,000 since the start of the year.\n\nBut what types of companies are actually paying for it? For good reason,\nOpenAI doesn\u2019t disclose many of their paying customers. But fortunately, with\nsome sleuthing skills, you can easily find out. When a company pays for a\nChatGPT team or enterprise subscription, they have to verify their domain name\nso everyone in their organization can log on. And they verify it by adding a\nDNS record with the string \u2018openai\u2019 in it.\n\nSo naturally for fun and profit, I decided to iterate through the DNS records\nfor as many organizations as I could to find out who is actually paying for\nChatGPT Enterprise. Are there any trends or patterns in the sectors,\ncountries, and size of their customers? Here\u2019s what I learned...\n\n### 1\\. ChatGPT Enterprise is used by only ~5% of the Fortune 500\n\nDespite the media hype, only ~5% of the Fortune 500 is ChatGPT\nEnterprise/Teams. Companies like Adobe, JetBlue, PwC, Hubspot, and Uber were\njust some of the biggest ChatGPT enterprise customers I found.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking at this with the glass half-full, there\u2019s still a very long\nrunway left for OpenAI. For comparison, Salesforce has >= 80% penetration\namong the Fortune 500, and Atlassian has >= 66% penetration. ChatGPT arguably\nhas more use cases than both of those tools. So we are still in the very early\ninnings of ChatGPT usage in the workplace.\n\n### 2\\. A lot of companies still have trust issues around ChatGPT\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s still some skepticism over whether ChatGPT is safe\nto use.\n\nOf all the major companies that put restrictions on ChatGPT last year, none of\nthem have changed their mind, including JP Morgan Chase, Apple, Amazon, and\nSpotify. Despite enterprise-grade security, and promises to never train on\ncustomer\u2019s data, a lot of of companies are cautious and taking a wait-and-see\napproach before signing up for ChatGPT Enterprise.\n\nFurthermore, I couldn\u2019t detect a single ChatGPT Enterprise customer among the\n10 biggest technology companies. Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Google,\nSalesforce, Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Oracle were nowhere to be found in the\nlist of paying customers. Some of them have their own competitor products like\nMicrosoft with Microsoft Copilot, and Google with Gemini, so naturally they\u2019d\nwant their employees to use their tools instead.\n\n### 3\\. Tech and financial companies are more likely to be paying customers\n\nUnsurprisingly, tech companies lead the way with a 8.2% adoption rate.\nFinancial services was 2nd with a 6.6% adoption rate, but the majority of\nthese customers were \u201cmodern\u201d fintech companies like Robinhood, Klarna, and\nChime rather than traditional banks like JP Morgan Chase, or Citigroup.\n\nThe sectors with the lowest adoption rates aren\u2019t too surprising: Industrials,\nand Utilities & Energy. These companies aren\u2019t focused as much on large-scale\ndata processing/analysis, or customer service, so it makes sense that these\ncompanies don\u2019t have a compelling use for ChatGPT yet.\n\nNot listed here are government agencies. We only detected a few government\nentities as paying customers, most noticeably the State of Pennsylvania. Of\ncourse, there\u2019s a lot of regulatory and compliance issues that need to be\ndealt with before government organizations will feel confident using AI tools,\nso I imagine it will be a very very long time before the IRS decides to use\nChatGPT to automate auditing tax returns (if ever)\n\n### 4\\. Startups are 2x more likely to be ChatGPT Enterprise customers than\npublic companies\n\nAmong all unicorns with >$1 billion valuation, 6% of them were ChatGPT\nEnterprise customers. Among all public companies > $1 billion market cap, only\n3% of them were ChatGPT Enterprise customers. Not a surprise here, given that\nstartups, by nature move faster than big, monolithic enterprises.\n\n### 5\\. US-based companies lead the way in adoption, with the EU and Canada\nlagging behind\n\nWhen it comes to which countries are adopting ChatGPT Enterprise, US-based\ncompanies lead the way, with 5.4% of the largest US companies.\n\nAmong all large EU-based companies we analyzed, only 2.6% of them were ChatGPT\nEnterprise customers. The EU has stringent data privacy and protection laws\nlike GDPR, and these regulations could make EU companies more cautious about\nadopting AI technologies like ChatGPT.\n\nAmong the countries we tracked, the country with the lowest rate of ChatGPT\nEnterprise adoption was Canada, which the Prime Minister of Canada probably\nwants to change with his $2 billion investment in AI.\n\n### 6\\. There\u2019s no link between companies that use ChatGPT Enterprise and\ntheir hiring\n\nIs there a relationship between companies that use ChatGPT Enterprise and\ntheir hiring rates? Are ChatGPT Enterprise users more likely to be cutting\njobs? So far the data says no. If anything it\u2019s the opposite. Companies that\nuse ChatGPT Enterprise had pretty much the same # of job openings in Q1\ncompared to Q1 of last year. However, companies that didn\u2019t use ChatGPT\nEnterprise had 7% less new job openings in Q1 of 2024 compared to Q1 of last\nyear.\n\nConclusion: It\u2019s far too early to analyze whether these AI tools will increase\nproductivity so much that less workers will be needed, but so far the data\nsays there\u2019s no need to worry yet.\n\n### 7\\. Companies that use ChatGPT Enterprise are not hiring AI talent as fast\nas companies that don\u2019t use ChatGPT Enterprise\n\nInteresting, companies that use ChatGPT Enterprise are not hiring AI talent as\nfast as companies that aren\u2019t using it.\n\nIn the first 3 months of this year, ChatGPT Enterprise companies had a 27%\nincrease in the # of new job openings that mention \u201cAI\u201d. In comparison,\ncompanies that aren\u2019t ChatGPT Enterprise customers had a whopping 120%\nincrease in the # of new job openings that mention \u2018AI\u2019.\n\nIt could be that non-customers are developing in-house AI tools and LLMs\ninstead of opting to use ChatGPT Enterprise. Building their own tools allows\nthem to tailor it to their own unique needs. It also helps them maintain more\ncontrol over their data and IP. And in order to build their own internal AI\ntools, they need to hire a lot more AI talent.\n\n### 8\\. Three of the Big 4 accounting firms use ChatGPT Enterprise\n\nPwC, KPMG and Ernst & Young all are ChatGPT Enterprise users, which shows that\neven large, slow organizations aren\u2019t afraid of adopting it. From auditing to\ntax compliance and conducting market research, there\u2019s a plethora of use cases\nthat fit into the workflow of these companies.\n\n### Summary\n\n  1. ChatGPT Enterprise is only used by 5% of the Fortune 500, and we\u2019re still in the very early innings\n  2. Most if not all companies that have restricted use of ChatGPT in the workplace have not changed their minds\n  3. Tech and financial companies lead the way in usage, with Industrials, Utilities, Energy and Government entities lagging behind\n  4. US-based companies lead the way in usage, with EU and Canada lagging behind\n  5. Companies that use ChatGPT Enterprise are not hiring less than companies that don\u2019t use ChatGPT Enterprise\n  6. Companies that use ChatGPT Enterprise are not hiring AI talent as faster as companies that don\u2019t use ChatGPT Enterprise\n\n## Subscribe to get more data-driven research on hiring, labor and AI trends\n\nFuture articles will include: outsourcing trends, our best attempt to use data\nto find out which careers are least likely to be replaced by AI, and more!
