This light has been stretched by the\nexpansion of the Universe and arrives at us as radiowaves. It is called the\nCosmic Microwave Background. See the sky view.\n\n# redshifted quasars\n\nAt these distances, the expansion of the Universe is so great that the blue\nphotons from quasars get stretched and appear redder. A bit farther, we\nencounter an epoch during which the Universe is filled with hydrogen gas that\nprevents the propagation of visible light we could observe today. This epoch\nis called the \"dark ages\". See the sky view.\n\n# quasars\n\nQuasars are massive black holes located at the center of certain galaxies. As\nthey accrete surrounding gas and stars, they become extremely bright and can\nbe seen across the Universe. Their light is blueish. See the sky view.\n\nBeyond this distance, galaxies are harder to see. However, we can still see\nquasars. They are much brighter and bluer.\n\n# redshifted elliptical galaxies\n\nAs the Universe expands, photons get stretched and objects appear redder. This\nis the case for the elliptical galaxies. At these distances, they appear red\nto us. As we no longer detect the fainter spiral galaxies, the filamentary\nstructure is less visible. See the sky view.\n\n# elliptical galaxies\n\nElliptical galaxies are yellowish and much brighter than spiral galaxies. We\ncan see them farther away. See the sky view.\n\n# spiral galaxies\n\nEach dot is a galaxy shown with its apparent color. Spiral galaxies are faint\nand blue. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is a blue spiral that would look like one\nof these if we could observe it from the outside.

It was created from astronomical data\ntaken night after night over a period of 15 years using a telescope in New\nMexico, USA. We are located at the bottom.

Its thickness is about 10 degrees. More astronomical data is\navailable but it is not possible to show all of it at once on a 2D map. The\nimage would be completely saturated with dots.\n\nEach tiny dot is a galaxy. About 200,000 are shown with their actual position\nand color. Each galaxy contains billions of stars and planets. We are located\nat the bottom. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is just a dot. Looking up, we see\nthat space is filled with galaxies forming a global filamentary structure.

This happened 13.7 billion years ago. Today we observe this\nradiation not as visible light but as radio waves. It is called the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background. It is the edge of the observable Universe.
