Image:\nUnsplash/anniespratt\n\n##### Victoria Masterson\n\nSenior Writer, Forum Agenda\n\nThis article was originally published in January 2024 and updated in February\n2024.\n\n  * The use of artificial intelligence (AI) can contribute to the fight against climate change.\n  * Existing AI systems include tools that predict weather, track icebergs and identify pollution.\n  * AI can also be used to improve agriculture and reduce its environmental impact, the World Economic Forum says.\n\nThe power of artificial intelligence (AI) to process huge amounts of data and\nhelp humans make decisions is transforming industries.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s toughest challenges, combating climate change is another\narea where AI has transformational potential.\n\nAlmost 4 billion people already live in areas highly vulnerable to climate\nchange, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAnd this is expected to lead to around 250,000 extra deaths a year between\n2030 and 2050, from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress alone.\n\nHere are nine ways AI is already helping to tackle climate change.\n\nAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.\n\nThese cookies are currently disabled in your browser.\n\n## 1\\. Icebergs are melting \u2013 AI knows where and how fast\n\nAI has been trained to measure changes in icebergs 10,000 times faster than a\nhuman could do it.\n\nThis will help scientists understand how much meltwater icebergs release into\nthe ocean \u2013 a process accelerating as climate change warms the atmosphere.\n\nScientists at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom say their AI can\nmap large Antarctic icebergs in satellite images in just one-hundredth of a\nsecond, reports the European Space Agency.\n\nFor humans, this task is lengthy and time-consuming, and it\u2019s hard to identify\nicebergs amid the white of clouds and sea ice.\n\nAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.\n\nThese cookies are currently disabled in your browser.\n\n## 2\\. Mapping deforestation with AI\n\nAI, satellite images and ecology expertise are also being used to map the\nimpact of deforestation on the climate crisis.\n\nSpace Intelligence, a company based in Edinburgh, Scotland, says it is working\nin more than 30 countries and has mapped more than 1 million hectares of land\nfrom space using satellite data.\n\nThe company\u2019s technology remotely measures metrics, such as deforestation\nrates and how much carbon is stored in a forest.\n\n## 3\\. AI is helping communities facing climate risks in Africa\n\nIn Africa, AI is being used in a United Nations project to help communities\nvulnerable to climate change in Burundi, Chad and Sudan.\n\nThe IKI Project uses AI technology to help predict weather patterns, so\ncommunities and authorities can better plan how to adapt to climate change and\nmitigate its impact.\n\nThis includes improving access to clean energy, implementing proper waste\nmanagement systems and encouraging reforestation.\n\nAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.\n\nThese cookies are currently disabled in your browser.\n\n## 4\\. Using AI to recycle more waste\n\nAnother AI system is helping to tackle climate change by making waste\nmanagement more efficient.\n\nWaste is a big producer of methane and is responsible for 16% of global\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, according to the United States Environmental\nProtection Agency.\n\nGreyparrot, a software startup based in London, United Kingdom, has developed\nan AI system that analyzes waste processing and recycling facilities to help\nthem recover and recycle more waste material.\n\nThe company tracked 32 billion waste items across 67 waste categories in 2022,\nand says it identifies 86 tonnes of material on average that could be\nrecovered but is being sent to landfill.\n\nAI is helping to fight climate change in systems, including those that\nidentify plastic pollution in the ocean. Image: The Ocean Cleanup\n\n## 5\\. AI is cleaning up the ocean\n\nIn the Netherlands, an environmental organization called The Ocean Cleanup is\nusing AI and other technologies to help clear plastic pollution from the\nocean.\n\nAI that detects objects is helping the organization create detailed maps of\nocean litter in remote locations. The ocean waste can then be gathered and\nremoved, which is more efficient than previous cleanup methods using trawlers\nand aeroplanes.\n\nPlastic pollution contributes to climate change by emitting GHGs and harming\nnature.\n\nAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.\n\nThese cookies are currently disabled in your browser.\n\n## 6\\. AI helps predict climate disasters\n\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, a company called Sipremo is using AI to predict where\nand when climate disasters will occur, and what type of climate disasters they\nwill be.\n\nThe aim is to help businesses and governments better prepare for climate\nchange and the growing challenges for communities that come with it.\n\nThe company works in industries including insurance, energy, logistics and\nsport, where its analysis of disaster conditions and factors such as air\nquality can inform decisions on whether to delay or suspend events.\n\nAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.\n\nThese cookies are currently disabled in your browser.\n\n## 7\\. A wish list of AI climate tools\n\nGoogle DeepMind, Google\u2019s AI research laboratory, says it is applying AI to\nhelp fight climate change in a number of areas.\n\nThis includes building a complete wish list of datasets that would advance\nglobal AI solutions for climate change. Google DeepMind is working on this\nwith Climate Change AI, a non-profit organization set up by volunteers from\nacademia and industry who see a key role for machine learning in combating\nclimate change.\n\nOther Google AI tools are focused on improving weather forecasting and\nincreasing the value of wind energy by better predicting the output from a\nwind farm.\n\nAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.\n\nThese cookies are currently disabled in your browser.\n\n## 8\\. How AI can help industry decarbonize\n\nAI is being used to help companies in the metal and mining, oil, and gas\nindustries to decarbonize their operations.\n\nEugenie.ai, based in California, United States, has developed an emissions-\ntracking platform that combines satellite imagery with data from machines and\nprocesses.\n\nAI then analyzes this data to help companies track, trace and reduce their\nemissions by 20-30%.\n\nIndustrial sectors generate around 30% of greenhouse gas emissions globally.\n\nDiscover\n\nHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial\nIntelligence?\n\nIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for\nrobust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes\nfor all, the Forum\u2019s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has\nlaunched the AI Governance Alliance.\n\nThe Alliance will unite industry leaders, governments, academic institutions,\nand civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and\nrelease of transparent and inclusive AI systems.\n\n## 9\\. Reforesting hills in Brazil using drones\n\nAI-powered computers are pairing up with drones in Brazil to reforest the\nhills around the coastal city of Rio de Janeiro, Reuters reports. The\ncomputers define the targets and number of seeds to be dropped.\n\nThe initiative, which launched in January 2024, is a partnership between Rio's\ncity hall and start-up Morfo, and aims to grow seeds in hard-to-reach areas.\n\nA single drone can disperse 180 seed capsules per minute, which is 100 times\nfaster than using human hands for traditional reforestation, according to the\nlocal government.\n\nAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.\n\nThese cookies are currently disabled in your browser.\n\n## The potential of AI in the future\n\nAI is one of the key emerging technologies explored in the World Economic\nForum\u2019s Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2023 report.\n\nThe report specifically looks at generative AI \u2013 a type of AI that creates\ncontent including text, images and computer programming.\n\nAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.\n\nThese cookies are currently disabled in your browser.\n\nIn the future, generative AI could be used in contexts such as drug design,\narchitecture and engineering, the Forum says.\n\nAI can also be used to improve agriculture and reduce its environmental impact\nby processing data from sensors placed on crops.\n\nThe technologies listed in the report, including sustainable aviation fuel,\ncan be used to help tackle global challenges like the climate crisis \u2013 but\nmore innovation is needed, the authors point out.\n\n##### Have you read?\n\n  * ##### Without AI, we won\u2019t meet ESG goals and address climate change\n\n  * ##### How artificial intelligence can help us prepare for climate adaptation\n\n  * ##### This is the AI balancing act: between its huge potential and growing emissions\n\nAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.\n\nThese cookies are currently disabled in your browser.\n\n##### Don't miss any update on this topic\n\nCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our\nlatest publications and analyses.\n\nSign up for free\n\nLicense and Republishing\n\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the\nCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International\nPublic License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the\nWorld Economic Forum.\n\n##### Stay up to date:\n\n#### Artificial Intelligence\n\n##### Related topics:\n\nArtificial IntelligenceClimate ChangeClimate and Nature\n\n##### Share:\n\nThe Big Picture\n\n##### Explore and monitor how Artificial Intelligence is affecting economies,\nindustries and global issues\n\nCrowdsource Innovation\n\n##### Get involved with our crowdsourced digital platform to deliver impact at\nscale\n\nGlobal Agenda\n\n## The Agenda Weekly\n\nA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agenda\n\nSubscribe today\n\nYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.
