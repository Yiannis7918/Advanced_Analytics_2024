We're told the technique, tagged CVE-2024-2201,\nwill work on any Intel CPU core.\n\nThe VU Amsterdam team \u2014 Sander Wiebing, Alvise de Faveri Tron, Herbert Bos and\nCristiano Giuffrida \u2014 have now open sourced InSpectre Gadget, an angr-based\nanalyzer, plus a database of gadgets found for Linux Kernel 6.6-rc4 on GitHub.\n\n\"Our efforts led to the discovery of 1,511 Spectre gadgets and 2,105 so-called\n'dispatch gadgets,'\" the academics added. \"The latter are very useful for an\nattacker, as they can be used to chain gadgets and direct speculation towards\na Spectre gadget.\"\n\nThese numbers suggest a \"nontrivial attack surface,\" said the researchers, who\npointed to an Intel security advisory that includes updated software-level\nmitigations for these kinds of Native BHI attacks.\n\nAs we understand things, Intel in 2022 addressed BHI attacks with hardware and\nsoftware-level protections as well as recommendations like not allowing\nunprivileged eBPF use.\n\nNow an updated exploit, dubbed Native BHI, was developed using InSpectre\nGadget that defeats those defense mechanisms, leading to the x86 titan issuing\nupdated advice for developers and patches for the Linux kernel to block\nexploitation of CVE-2024-2201 \u2013 we assume other operating systems will need\nfixing up, too.\n\n\"External academic researchers reported new techniques to identify BHI\nsequences that could allow a local attacker who can already execute code to\npossibly infer the contents of Linux kernel memory,\" an Intel spokesperson\ntold The Register today.\n\n\"Intel has previously shared mitigation guidance for BHI and intra-mode BTI\nattacks. In light of this new report, Intel is releasing updated guidance to\nassist in broader deployment of these mitigations.\"\n\nAMD and Arm cores are not vulnerable to Native BHI, according to the VU\nAmsterdam team. AMD has since confirmed this in an advisory\n\n### History lesson\n\nInSpectre Gadget, and the related research and Native BHI exploit, builds on\nthe boffins' earlier work exploiting the Spectre variant BHI.\n\nSpectre emerged in public in early 2018, along the related Meltdown design\nblunder, which The Register first reported. Over the years various variants of\nSpectre have been found, prompting engineers to shore up the security around\nperformance-boosting speculative execution units.\n\n  * Linux kernel logic allowed Spectre attack on 'major cloud provider'\n  * Another data-leaking Spectre bug found, smashes Intel, Arm defenses\n  * Downfall fallout: Intel knew AVX chips were insecure and did nothing, lawsuit claims\n  * Rust rustles up fix for 10/10 critical command injection bug on Windows\n\nAfter the aforementioned steps were taken to shut down BHI-style attacks,\n\"this mitigation left us with a dangling question: 'Is finding 'native'\nSpectre gadgets for BHI, ie, not implanted through eBPF, feasible?'\" the\nacademics asked.\n\nThe short answer is yes. A technical paper [PDF] describing Native BHI is due\nto be presented at the USENIX Security Symposium. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Intel\n  * Research\n  * Security\n\nMore like
