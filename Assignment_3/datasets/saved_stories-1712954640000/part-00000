Underpinning this process is a phenomenon known as\ndendritic translation, which involves an uptick in localized protein\nproduction within dendrites, the spiny branches that project off the neuron\ncell body and receive signals from other neurons at synapses. It\u2019s a process\nkey to memory\u2014and its dysfunction is linked to intellectual disorders.\n\nThat makes the inner workings of dendritic translation a \u201choly grail for\nunderstanding memory formation,\u201d says Rockefeller\u2019s Robert B. Darnell, whose\nteam just published a study in Nature Neuroscience describing a new platform\ncapable of identifying the specific regulatory mechanisms that drive dendritic\ntranslation. The team leveraged a method, dubbed TurboID, to discover an\nentire suite of previously unknown factors in memory formation, revealing now\nmechanisms that underlie how protein synthesis in dendrites contributes to\nlearning and memory. The findings may also have implications for intellectual\ndisabilities, such as Fragile X syndrome.\n\n\u201cTechnological limitations have long prevented a comprehensive inventory of\nthe activity at the synapse involved in memory formation,\u201d says lead author\nEzgi Hacisuleyman, who conducted the research as a postdoctoral researcher in\nDarnell\u2019s laboratory. She is now an assistant professor at The Herbert\nWertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology. \u201cOur new\ntechniques can accomplish this with extremely high resolution to look at\nneurons in vitro that are closely mimicking what we see in the brain.\u201d\n\n\u201cHacisuleyman\u2019s work defines a whole new biochemical pathway which fits with,\ncomplements, and vastly expands what we already knew about memory and\nlearning,\u201d adds Darnell, the Robert and Harriet Heilbrunn professor.\n\nA unique way to metabolize RNA\n\nMemory formation centers around the hippocampus, a brain region so central to\nlearning that, when surgeons removed it from people with epilepsy in the\n1940s, the patients remembered their childhoods but lost the ability to form\nnew memories. It has since become clear that memories form, in part, because\nof new protein synthesis made locally in the dendrites of the hippocampus.\n\nDarnell, a physician-scientist, observed the importance of dendritic\ntranslation firsthand while working with patients whose immune systems had\nattacked the hippocampus. \u201cI would talk to a patient for 30 minutes, leave the\nroom, walk back in, and it was like they had never seen me before,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I began focusing on why neurons of the hippocampus have their own\nsystem for regulating RNA metabolism\u2014a system that no other cell in the body\nuses.\u201d\n\nThat system, it turns out, lies at the heart of how our brains form memories\nand learn new information, and became a focus for the Darnell lab, culminating\nin his team\u2019s 2003 development of CLIP, a method that allowed researchers to\nstudy the proteins that bind and influence RNA. But limitations remained.\n\u201cMany details about how neurons respond to stimuli at the dendrites were still\nmissing,\u201d Hacisuleyman says. \u201cWe needed that information, because that plays a\nrole in determining how neurons function\u2014and where things often go awry in\nneurologic disease.\u201d\n\n1,000 micropeptides\n\nTo get a better idea of the role that changes in dendrites play in learning,\nHacisuleyman extended the TurboID platform to works in concert with RNA-\nsequencing, CLIP, translation and protein analysis. The platform allowed the\nteam to track activity in dendrites before, during, and several minutes after\nthe neuron activates, capturing the moments critical to protein synthesis in\nthe cell and, more importantly, the stage considered key to memory formation.\n\nAn analysis of these crucial moments revealed a microscopic upheaval in the\ndendrite. Upon activation, local ribosomes jump onto mRNAs, an action that has\nall the biochemical hallmarks of memory formation, and which models predicted\nwill cause the dendrite to produce not only new proteins, but 1,000 small\nproteins known as micropeptides, with as-yet unknown function. The team also\nidentified an RNA-binding protein that helps seal the connection between these\nribosomes and mRNA, and demonstrated that if that protein is disabled, the\nproposed micropeptides and their associated downstream proteins will not form.\n\n\u201cWe never knew these micropeptides might even exist,\u201d Darnell says. \u201cIt opens\na new field of study, where we can ask what these peptides might be doing and\nhow they could play into memory formation. It\u2019s such a vast discovery that\nthere are dozens if not hundreds of avenues in which to pursue this.\u201d\n\nAmong the many observations that researchers will unpack in future studies,\none stood out: the team noted that a certain protein stood out for its\nprolific binding of mRNA in the dendrite. The protein, called FMRP, is key to\nbrain development and function, and genetic mutations that adversely impact\nFMRP contribute to Fragile X syndrome, one of the most common genetic causes\nof intellectual disability. \u201cOur findings fit nicely with the molecular\nbiology of FMRP, and also open the door to future insights into what is going\nwrong in Fragile X,\u201d Darnell says.\n\nBeyond the paper\u2019s immediate findings, dendritic-TurboID could also allow\nresearchers to examine RNA regulation and protein synthesis in other brain\nregions and apply the findings to different diseases. \u201cWe can now begin to\nlook at many other sites with a fine-toothed comb,\u201d Hacisuleyman says.\n\n\u201cWhen you develop a new technique as Hacisuleyman did, you enter a room that\nnobody has ever been in before,\u201d Darnell adds. \u201cThe light turns on, and the\nfindings just take your breath away.\u201d\n\nExplore:\n\nAll latest news\n\nRobert B.
