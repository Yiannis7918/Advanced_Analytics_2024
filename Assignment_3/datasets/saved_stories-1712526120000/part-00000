In a fascinating recent study\narxiv.org/pdf/2310.02557.pdf, St\u00e9phane Mallat and his collaborators show\nthat...it depends.\n\nTake a model with a fixed (large!) number of parameters that need to be\nlearnt. Train your model with a certain number N of images \u2014 for example human\nfaces or bedrooms. When N is smaller than a certain critical number (that\ngrows with the number of parameters of the model), the model simply memorizes\nand is only able to regenerate images it has been trained on.\n\n#### But as the number of examples keeps increasing, the model suddenly starts\ninnovating:\n\nit transforms random noise seeds into perfectly credible human faces or\nbedrooms it has never seen in the training set. The parrot has managed to\ngrasp the deep underlying structure of images. It can now \u201ccreate\u201d, not within\nthe bounds of its memory, but within the bounds imposed by the grammar it has\nmanaged to learn. For N large enough, the model no longer plagiarizes, but\ngenuinely innovates.\n\nThere is something even more striking in that respect: suppose now the\ntraining is done on two completely different set of images, leading to two a\npriori different models, say Alice and Bob (S1 and S2 in the figure below). At\nfirst, as we just said, Alice and Bob can only regenerate images from the\nrepertoire. Beyond the generalization transition, Alice and Bob are now able\nto transform a random noise seed into a new image, not seen in the data set.\nBut amazingly, Alice and Bob generate the *same* image from the same seed! In\nother words, the set of new images they can create is the same, even when they\nboth learnt to do so on different examples. This clearly shows that what Alice\nand Bob have learnt is not merely images but indeed an underlying \u201cgrammar\u201d,\ni.e. a unique rule that transforms pure noise into legit images.\n\nThis observation has far-reaching implications, for example in the context of\nfinancial markets. Generating realistic artificial financial time series has\nmany interesting applications, for example for option pricing, portfolio\nstress testing, etc... What we understand from Mallat\u2019s work is that when\ntrained on small data sets, large generative models will only parrot the past\nand will not generate Black Swans. Alas, financial data is scarce \u2013 so we must\nrestrict to models a relatively small number of parameters.\n\n#### This is precisely where the \u201cWavelet Scattering Spectra\u201d method may come\nin handy!\n\nWith only a few hundreds of parameters, Rudy Morel, G. Rochette, R.\nLeonarduzzi, S. Mallat and myself have been able to train a model that seems\nto be able to do better than overfit the past. Embedded in what we called the\n\u201cPath Shadowing Monte-Carlo\u201d method, we have been able to generate extremely\nrealistic, time dependent option smiles, see [2308.01486] Path Shadowing\nMonte-Carlo (arxiv.org)\n\nPrevPrevious ArticleHow New Jersey is Embracing AI\n\nNext ArticleHow do you evaluate a covariance matrix?Next\n\n## Recent Articles\n\n### is UNC Asheville A Party School?\n\nRead More\n\n### How Good & Prestigious is UNC Asheville?\n\nRead More\n\n### What is a good GPA for UIC?\n\nRead More\n\n### is UIC A Good School?\n\nRead More\n\n## Open An Account\n\nOpen an account with Rebellion Research now and manage your assets\nintelligently.\n\nSign up now!\n\n## Subscribe To Our Newsletter\n\nReceive the latest AI investment news, offers, and updates from Rebellion\nResearch.\n\n  * Email us at info@rebellionresearch.com for any questions\n\nFacebook-f Twitter Instagram Linkedin\n\nCopyright 2024 \u00a9 All rights Reserved. | Press\n\nDesign by EMAK Solution\n\nREBELLION RESEARCH ADVISORS, L.P.
