Do\nthey herald the end of the level playing field, or are they the saviour of\nlong-distance racing?\n\nTim Lewis\n\nShare\n\nThe 31-year-old British athlete Phil Sesemann arrived at the Seville marathon\nin February with a clear aim: to run the 26.2-mile course in less then two\nhours, eight minutes and 10 seconds. If he recorded that time or went faster,\nhe\u2019d meet the British qualifying standard to compete for Team GB at this\nsummer\u2019s Olympics in Paris; one second slower, he would be watching the race\nfrom his sofa at home in Leeds.\n\nHaving a plan and executing it are, of course, very different propositions,\nespecially in the marathon, a fabled distance that has been sadistically\nbreaking hearts, minds and bodies for more than two millennia. And the\nqualifying time was no small achievement: only three British men had ever run\nfaster. Add to this that Sesemann, who has dark hair and the angular\nhandsomeness of Cillian Murphy, is still pretty raw at the event. For much of\nhis 20s, he combined part-time running with being a junior doctor at St\nJames\u2019s hospital in Leeds. He only switched to the marathon in late 2021 and\nwould need to run a huge personal best (PB) to qualify.\n\nIn the buildup, Sesemann trained harder than ever before, clocking up well\nover 100 miles a week. In January, he decamped to Kenya for a month, running\nat altitude with (or, often, behind) the world\u2019s top distance athletes. Back\nat home, he pounded canal paths with his two dogs, Kipchoge and Haile \u2013 a\nspaniel-vizsla cross and German short-haired pointer respectively, named after\nmarathon legends \u2013 who have modest Instagram celebrity as the \u201cmileage mutts\u201d.\n\nThe final pieces of the puzzle were the shoes that Sesemann would wear on race\nday. Ever since 2016, there has been a technological arms race between the\nmajor footwear brands, especially Nike and Adidas. Nike was first out of the\nblocks with the original \u201csuper shoe\u201d, which it called the Zoom Vaporfly 4%.\nThe 4% referred to the estimated typical improvement in efficiency \u2013 verified\nby an independent biomechanist, Rodger Kram from the University of Colorado,\ncommissioned by Nike \u2013 that a runner could expect to enjoy wearing the shoes,\ncompared with the best alternative on the market.\n\n> I\u2019ll probably frame the Seville pair, just because they\u2019re covered in blood\n> and it makes me look quite hard\n\nPhil Sesemann\n\nMany innovations are described as gamechanging, but the Zoom Vaporflys were\nprecisely that: a 4% boost, in the marathon especially, was not a matter of\nseconds; it meant several minutes. World records duly tumbled by jaw-dropping\nmargins. Moreover, the new shoes radically turned on its head what we expected\nathletic footwear to look like. Conventional wisdom had always suggested that\nthe optimal shoes for long-distance running were sleek and minimalist, with a\nsmall strip of cushioning; they were called \u201crunning flats\u201d. The Nike Vaporfly\n4% looked, in contrast, like a moon boot: a large wedge of foam, adapted from\naircraft insulation, sat under the foot. Inside the shoe was a spoon-shaped,\ncarbon-fibre plate, which rocked forwards and made runners feel they were\nbeing propelled downhill.\n\nBut Adidas, which sponsors Sesemann, along with other footwear brands, had\ncaught up fast. For the Seville marathon, he wanted to run in their latest\ncarbon shoes: the Adizero Adios Pro Evo 1. The Evo 1s had only been out a few\nmonths but were already causing a stir. They were super-lightweight, just\n138g, which was 40% lighter than any racing shoe Adidas had made before. They\nalso had a \u201cfirst-of-its-kind forefoot rocker\u201d that encouraged forward\nmomentum and improved running efficiency.\n\nAnd, extraordinarily, the Evo 1s were recommended by Adidas as single use: you\nwore them for one race and they were spent. The Ethiopian athlete Tigist\nAssefa used a prototype of the shoes at the Berlin marathon last September and\ndestroyed the women\u2019s world record by more than two minutes. The Evo 1s were,\nAssefa said, \u201clike nothing I\u2019ve felt before\u201d.\n\nSo yes, Sesemann wanted some of that. The only problem was that there was a\nglobal shortage of the Evo 1s. They were released to the public, costing \u00a3400,\nand sold out almost immediately; their resale value is usually more than\n\u00a31,000. Even as an Adidas athlete, running for Olympic qualification, Sesemann\ncouldn\u2019t be guaranteed getting the shoes. Eventually, a few days before\nSeville, Adidas sent him a pair of size nines. The snag was that Sesemann is a\n9.5: for the first time in his career, he decided to race without socks. He\ngambled that the benefits conferred by the Evo 1s would outweigh the\ndiscomfort.\n\nThat gamble, as the race progressed, didn\u2019t seem to be paying off. Sesemann\nwas running faster than he ever had but, according to his calculations, he\nremained resolutely outside the Olympic qualifying time. Moreover, his feet\nwere being shredded by the tight shoes. \u201cThey were very bloody, like\ncongealed, clotted blood on the back of my heels,\u201d he says. \u201cYeah, it wasn\u2019t\nthe prettiest sight.\u201d\n\nPhil Sesemann laughing with a pacemaker during the 2023 London Marathon.\nPhotograph: Avpics/Alamy\n\nSesemann dug in as the miles ticked on, but it was hard not to feel\ndisheartened. \u201cIt was horrendous, to be really honest,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was\nchecking my splits on my watch the whole way through and I was just thinking:\n\u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m going to miss this by one or two seconds.\u2019 I basically\nconvinced myself that I wasn\u2019t going to do it.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, something happened. Sesemann powered on; he forgot about the\nthrobbing in his feet. At the finish line, he looked up and saw the magic\nnumbers: two hours, eight minutes and four seconds. Six seconds faster than\nthe qualifying standard; he was going to the Olympics. \u201cYou think: \u2018I\u2019ve done\nit, I\u2019ve worked for so long for this,\u2019\u201d says Sesemann. \u201cSo yeah, really\nsweet.\u201d\n\nSince the race, Sesemann has sometimes wondered what made the difference, that\nmost marginal gain of six seconds over more than two hours. Was it the spell\nin Kenya? The extra training miles? The super shoes? He can\u2019t be sure, but\nhe\u2019s not going to be tossing his Evo 1s in the bin, anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to\nthrow away a \u00a3400 pair of shoes,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cI\u2019ll probably frame the\nSeville pair just because they\u2019re covered in blood and it makes me look quite\nhard. And obviously, it was the peak of my career.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlood, sweat and tears,\u201d Sesemann goes on. \u201cSo yeah, I won\u2019t be throwing that\npair away for sure.\u201d\n\nEvery sport is streamlined over time by technology and new materials. Where\nthese developments overstep a mark is often contentious. Formula One has seen\nmany battles on this front over the years. In the mid-1970s, the Tyrrell team\nexperimented with a six-wheeled car: it won one race, but struggled with\nconsistency and was phased out. In 1978, Brabham engineers used the (perfectly\nlegal) tactic of installing a large fan in the back of the car, which\ndramatically improved its aerodynamics. The BT46B won its first race by 34\nseconds but was promptly withdrawn, and later banned, after complaints from\nrivals.\n\n> There\u2019s a sizeable constituency of people who think that super shoes have\n> made the world record pretty meaningless\n\nAndy Dixon\n\nBut the most direct comparison with carbon running shoes is the Speedo LZR\nRacer full-body swimsuit that was launched in 2008. At the Beijing Olympics\nthat summer, 98% of all swimming medals were won by athletes in the suit,\nwhich significantly reduced skin-friction drag. In a little over a year, 93\nworld records were broken in the LZR Racer, leading swimming\u2019s governing body\nFina to bring in a set of new restrictions in 2010 that essentially outlawed\nfull-body suits.\n\nWhen the Nike Zoom Vaporfly was first released, similar concerns were raised\nabout \u201ctechnological doping\u201d. In the men\u2019s marathon at the 2016 Olympics, all\nthree places on the podium were taken by Nike-endorsed athletes wearing an\nunreleased prototype of the Vaporfly. As the other shoe brands scrabbled to\ncatch up, it became manifestly clear that the playing field in distance\nrunning was no longer a level one. Athletes not wearing the Vaporfly were\nclearly at a disadvantage: in these early days, some desperate top runners who\nwere sponsored by other brands even took to wearing the shoes and taping over\nthe swoosh.\n\nSpeedo\u2019s LZR Racer swimsuit. Photograph: Speedo/PA\n\nUnlike swimming, the athletics authorities took a more lenient view of the new\ntechnology. World Athletics, the governing body of track and field, only\nstepped in in 2020, stipulating the foam base of the shoes can be no higher\nthan 40mm (the exact height of the Vaporfly, as it happens) and ruling that\nthere could not be more than a single carbon plate. They also initially\nforbade the use of prototypes \u2013 athletes could only race in shoes that had\nbeen available to purchase for at least four months \u2013 but that judgment was\nlater overturned.\n\nThe decision not to restrict carbon shoes had a significant impact on the\nrecord books. On both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s side, nine out of the 10 fastest\nmarathons in history have been run by athletes wearing carbon shoes. Comparing\nthe best runners of today with previous generations is now pretty well\nimpossible. \u201cThere\u2019s a sizeable constituency of people who think that super\nshoes have made the world record pretty meaningless,\u201d says Andy Dixon, the\neditor-in-chief of Runner\u2019s World. \u201cIt\u2019s like comparing apples with pears. If\nthe shoe is giving you three or four minutes, then this idea of a world record\nbeing a metric for human excellence is definitely skewed. Some people have\neven suggested that there should be an asterisk by records set with super\nshoes.\u201d\n\nThe only female athlete from the pre-carbon-shoe era to feature in the top 10\nmarathon times is Britain\u2019s Paula Radcliffe. Her mark \u2013 two hours, 15 minutes,\n25 seconds \u2013 was recorded at the London marathon in 2003; it would remain the\nworld record for 16 years and is still the sixth-fastest time in history.\n\nDoes Radcliffe think there should be an asterisk next to the new times? She\nshakes her head and laughs, \u201cI would love it to still be the world record. And\nfor the shoes maybe to have not come along. But I think the one thing that\nmost athletes want to be able to do is finish their career and say: \u2018OK, I\nachieved what I was capable of doing. I ran as fast as I was capable of\ndoing.\u2019 And I guess in all areas bar the Olympic Games, I can say that I did\nthat with my career. So those times, yeah, do make me proud. Then, in my mind,\nI know that they were run in the old shoes as well!\u201d\n\nRadcliffe had a front-row seat as carbon shoes were being developed. She was\nsponsored by Nike throughout her career until she retired in 2015 after a\nlong-term battle with degenerative osteoarthritis in the arch of her foot. The\nprototype of the Zoom Vaporfly was unveiled the following year. \u201cI know some\nof the designers at Nike,\u201d she says, \u201cand they told me: \u2018We\u2019re designing a\nshoe that\u2019s going to break your record.\u2019 I was like: \u2018Thanks, guys!\u2019\u201d\n\nUltimately, though, Radcliffe has decided that she was fortunate to compete in\nthe era before super shoes. She was known for her attritional style of racing\n\u2013 her head furiously bobbing, every sinew stretched \u2013 so the idea of a labour-\nsaving piece of kit is not really on-brand for her.\n\n\u201cPeople have asked me a lot of times: what could I run in the shoes?\u201d she\nsays. \u201cAnd the answer is I don\u2019t know. I think I could have run quicker. But\nat the same time, I\u2019m glad I had my time when I did because what made me\nstrong and unbeatable through 2002 and 2003 essentially wouldn\u2019t be as big of\nan advantage in today\u2019s shoes. Because I was very, very good mentally and\nphysically at withstanding the beating up of your body that hits you at 30km,\nand keeping going. That doesn\u2019t hit runners now.\u201d\n\nAll serious runners can remember the first time they wore carbon shoes in a\nrace. For Rose Harvey, a 31-year-old athlete who now has the sixth-fastest\nmarathon time for British women, it was in 2017. Back then, she was a\ncorporate lawyer in London who mainly used to run to work, dodging commuters.\nHer goal was to break 80 minutes for the half-marathon and she just couldn\u2019t\ndo it. Eventually, Harvey cracked and dropped \u00a3200 on the second iteration of\nthe Nike Vaporfly.\n\n\u201cI was sceptical about them for a long time thinking: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just\nmarketing,\u2019\u201d says Harvey. \u201cPut them on for the race day and yeah, I ran a lot\nfaster. I ran one hour 16 minutes, so just immediately knocked five minutes\noff my PB. I also got the worst blisters ever. I couldn\u2019t walk the next day,\nbut it was worth it!\u201d\n\n> The marathon still is that mythical, humbling distance, but it\u2019s that little\n> bit more tamed, that little bit more accessible now\n\nPaula Radcliffe\n\nAfterwards, however, Harvey did feel some conflict. \u201cNow everyone just wears\nthem,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just become: \u2018Why wouldn\u2019t you, if you can run\nfaster?\u2019 But back then I wasn\u2019t doing this professionally, I was literally\ndoing it just to see if I could break 80 minutes, and it did feel a bit like\ncheating.\u201d\n\nCarbon shoes may have inspired some soul-searching in elite athletics, but\nHarvey is right: among recreational runners, they are wildly popular. \u201cI don\u2019t\nthink people care [about the world record debate]!\u201d says Dixon. \u201cIf you were\nchasing a PB in a marathon it\u2019s like: \u2018Would you choose a hilly course or a\nflat course?\u2019 You\u2019d choose a flat course. \u2018Would you wear a normal shoe or a\nsuper shoe?\u2019 There\u2019s no doubt, you\u2019d go for a super shoe because well, that\u2019s\nan extra two minutes off your time. So these shoes have been massively\ncommercially successful.\u201d\n\nTracksmith\u2019s Eliot Racer carbon-fibre shoe. Photograph: tracksmith.com\n\nIt\u2019s certainly true that there has been a softening in opposition to carbon\nshoes. When they were first released, they appeared to threaten the integrity\nof long-distance running. Now, it\u2019s not hard to find advocates who believe the\nshoes are injecting new excitement into \u2013 maybe even becoming the saviour of \u2013\nevents such as the marathon. One of these is Matt Taylor, the founder of\nupstart running brand Tracksmith, which is looking to do for running what\nRapha has done for the cycling market. Like everyone else, Tracksmith will be\nunveiling its own carbon shoe, the Eliot Racer, this summer.\n\n\u201cWithout super shoes, I think the marathon would be declining, declining,\ndeclining,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cWe had reached the peak. It was like: \u2018OK,\neveryone\u2019s run a marathon. It\u2019s not that impressive any more.\u2019 And then the\nsuper shoes came along and now it\u2019s reignited this interest in that distance.\u201d\n\nFor Taylor, the shoes will inspire individuals to see if they can go faster or\nfurther. \u201cMarathons are two to three hours, right, but people that are running\nfour, five, six, seven hours, that\u2019s where it could get really interesting in\nterms of chasing where the limits are,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of potential\nstill on the ultra side.\u201d\n\nRose Harvey, meanwhile, has gone from being a weekend runner to one of\nBritain\u2019s top endurance athletes. The journey \u2013 a \u201csliding door moment\u201d \u2013\nstarted when she was made redundant from her job as a lawyer at the outset of\nthe Covid pandemic. Running became her lockdown project and she took hefty\nchunks off her marathon times: from a personal best of nearly three hours,\ndown to two hours, 23 minutes at the Chicago marathon last year. Harvey is now\nsponsored by Puma and will find out this month if she has been selected for\nthe British Olympic team.\n\nRose Harvey after finishing the 2022 London Marathon. Photograph: Gary\nMitchell, GMP Media/Alamy\n\nFor serious athletes such as Harvey, perhaps the main benefit of carbon-fibre\nshoes is that they allow you to train more intensively, with a lower risk of\ninjury. (Like many professionals, she does about 70% of her training in non-\ncarbon shoes; super shoes are reserved for the most extreme efforts.) \u201cThey\nobviously do make you go faster, which on race day is a big advantage,\u201d says\nHarvey. \u201cBut in training, the main advantage of carbon shoes is just the\nrecovery. Before, I wouldn\u2019t be able to walk the day after ... well, for a\nweek after a marathon. But after Chicago, I was running the next day and your\nlegs don\u2019t feel that beaten up.\u201d\n\nSuper shoes are here to stay, and most experts expect to see the records keep\ntumbling. The foam formulations should become even lighter and bouncier; the\ncarbon plates will offer more spring and responsiveness. On the men\u2019s side,\nthe two-hour marathon, which for so long has been the holy grail of distance\nrunning, will probably finally be toppled. Kelvin Kiptum from Kenya, last\nyear\u2019s winner of the London marathon, had already come close, winning the 2023\nChicago marathon in two hours, 35 seconds, a new world record. Kiptum, though,\ndied in a car crash in February, aged 24.\n\nAt this year\u2019s London marathon, on Sunday 21 April, super shoes will certainly\nbe on the feet of many runners. Some will be looking to set new personal\nbests; but most will be happy to cover the course without their bodies\nsurrendering to the pummelling. \u201cIt still is that mythical, humbling\ndistance,\u201d says Radcliffe, who will be commentating on the event for the BBC.\n\u201cBut I guess it\u2019s that little bit more tamed, that little bit more accessible\nnow than it was.\u201d\n\nJust a word of advice: if you speak to someone who has completed the marathon,\ndon\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that their super shoes made it easy. \u201cAt\nthe end of the day, the shoes do help, but you\u2019ve still got to be able to run\nat that pace,\u201d says Rose Harvey. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got to run the damn thing!\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Marathon\n  * The Observer\n  * Nike\n  * Marathon running\n  * Athletics\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Football\n  * Cricket\n  * Rugby union\n  * Tennis\n  * Cycling\n  * F1\n  * Golf\n  * US sports\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
