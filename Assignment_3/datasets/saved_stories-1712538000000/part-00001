I watched one of the best TV shows on Vision Pro,\nenjoying spectacular immersion and facing real discomforts.\n\nWritten by David Gewirtz, Senior Contributing Editor April 6, 2024 at 4:30\na.m. PT\n\n### must read\n\nWill the solar eclipse burn out the camera on your iPhone?\n\nRead now\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThis morning, for the first time, I watched a full, hour-long TV show on the\nApple Vision Pro. It was both glorious and kind of crappy, all at the same\ntime.\n\nPart of my mission here at ZDNET is to help you understand, viscerally, what\nthis new spatial computing paradigm is like, without you necessarily having to\ngo out and plunk down nearly $4,000.\n\nAlso: I watched Apple's newest Immersive Video on the Vision Pro, and it was\nmy 'aha' moment\n\nI haven't really been using the Vision Pro as a media consumption device. I've\nfocused most of my time on understanding how to do specific things with it so\nI can write helpful how-to articles. I've used it a lot, but mostly five and\nten minutes at a time, dipping in to grab a screenshot or take a quick video,\nand popping out again to write about it.\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Tech Today\n\nZDNET's Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked\nabout stories, five days a week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\nI've been testing the Vision Pro mostly in our family room, which doubles as\nour primary co-working space for our work-from-home jobs. That's nice, because\nI sometimes get to use my La-Z-Boy as my desk chair, and my pup can sit on my\nlap while working.\n\nLast weekend, it was early, and I wanted to watch some wake-up TV. Denise was\ngoing to be using the room's big TV for a Zoom meeting, so that meant I'd\neither have to watch car shows on a small monitor or... lightbulb... I could\nwatch something on the Vision Pro.\n\nI've been wanting to rewatch the entire four seasons of For All Mankind, the\nalternate history space race drama on Apple TV+. It's that good. So, I decided\nI'd watch the first episode while she was in her meeting, and I'd do it inside\nthe spatial computing cocoon of the Vision Pro.\n\n## Apple TV+ on the Vision Pro\n\nThe Apple TV+ app provides a couple of viewing options on the Vision Pro. The\nfirst is just a window in passthrough mode, where you see the show floating in\nspace, with whatever your room is as a backdrop. That didn't interest me at\nall. I wanted full immersion.\n\nAlso: What apps will be on Apple Vision Pro? Not these two major ones\n\nFor full immersion, there are two options. You can choose to watch in one of\nthe full 3D environments (like Mount Hood, which is my favorite). Or, you can\nwatch in Cinema mode, which makes your entire field of view black, and puts a\nscreen in front of you with a gray virtual floor and a slightly textured\nvirtual ceiling.\n\nI chose Cinema mode.\n\nYou can also choose your seating: Front, Middle, or Back, and whether you're\non the floor level or balcony. Balcony is weird. Everything is low and you\nhave to look down. Floor level puts the screen right in front of me, which is\nnice when sitting in the recliner, so I chose Floor.\n\nScreenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nNow, let's talk about screen placement. If you choose to be seated in the\nBack, you get a screen that looks like an 80-inch or so TV screen. Big, but\nnot that big. If you choose Middle, you get a screen that's bigger.\n\nThe Vision Pro doesn't allow the taking of screenshots of TV and movie\ncontent. This image asset was provided by Apple and represents the Back size\nof the cinema view.\n\nApple\n\nBut, my dear friend, if you choose Front, you get a screen that appears to be\nat least 15 feet tall and probably 25 or more feet wide. I was suddenly in a\ndarkened space that was substantially bigger than the actual room I was in,\nwatching a screen that would have had to punch through the ceiling and blast\ninto the laundry room next door.\n\nIf you've ever gone to a real movie theatre and sat in one of the first four\nor five rows, that's what it felt like to me.\n\nIt. Was. Glorious.\n\nAlso: Apple Vision Pro tricks: How to take perfect screenshots and recordings\n(and avoid weirdness)\n\nImage quality was, for the most part, spectacular as well. For All Mankind\nisn't in 3D, but it's a very visually compelling show. That said, the quality\nof the skin on the actors' faces, rendered 15 feet high, was spectacular.\n\nUnfortunately, I did get some weird edge blurring and smudging. I'm using\nprescription lens inserts. Despite me having cleaned them just before\nwatching, the streaking was still present. I'm not sure whether that was a\nlight leak or a streak on the lenses, but it was distracting.\n\nIt wasn't distracting enough for me to stop the show, but it was one of those\nannoyances I just wished wasn't there.\n\nAnd yet, watching the show was incredible in that environment.\n\n## The reality of virtual reality\n\nBut it wasn't all vintage 1969 Corvette Stingrays and Apollo 11. There were\nsome problems. The first was audio...\n\n### 1\\. AirPods ala mode\n\nThrough previous experiments, I knew that the Vision Pro's native speakers\ncould be heard in the room. So I planned to use my AirPods Max instead.\nUnfortunately, as soon as I turned on the show and put on the AirPods Max, I\nfelt a tapping on my knee.\n\n\"Honey, that's awfully loud. Can you fix it?\"\n\nFor some reason, the AirPods Max had not properly connected, and the sound was\nstill coming out of the Vision Pro. I later figured out that, although the\nAirPods Max are automatically bound to the Vision Pro through my iCloud\naccount, they hadn't connected automatically. I had apparently missed tapping\nthe Connect button when it flashed on the screen.\n\nAlso: 7 hidden costs of the Apple Vision Pro to factor into your XR budget\n\nInstead, I switched to my AirPods Pro, and that prevented her and her Zoom\ncolleagues from hearing the audio of my TV show.\n\nBut there was another gotcha. I couldn't get the AirPods Pro to turn on noise\ncanceling mode. Even though I dug all through the Vision Pro's Settings menu\nand the Control Panel, I found nothing that seemed to allow any mode change to\nthe AirPods.\n\nSo, while she couldn't hear me, I could hear her. For the entire show. That\nwas unfortunate.\n\nAs it turns out, you can turn on noise cancelling. After a bit of Googling, I\nfound the answer. First, go to Settings and then the Bluetooth tab. Next to\nAirPods Pro, tap the little Info button.\n\nScreenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nYou'll get a whole dedicated AirPods Pro settings panel. Go ahead and tap\nNoise Cancellation.\n\nScreenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThere's also an option at the bottom of the panel to change the Noise Control\nsetting via a tap on either the left or right AirPod. Tap the AirPod you want,\nand then choose the action you'd prefer.\n\nScreenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nSo, yes, you can turn on noise cancellation. I just didn't know how to do it\non my first run.\n\nJust because I love you folks and want to give you the complete story, I later\nforced myself to watch the second episode of some of the best TV ever made, on\nwhat is probably the most intense giant TV screen I've ever watched. And yeah,\nboth the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max worked just fine.\n\n### 2\\. Eyestrain and itchy itch\n\nI watched the first 20 minutes of the show in entertainment center bliss, but\nthen my eyes started to hurt and my face (the part inside the headset) started\nto itch.\n\nI made sure to close and blink my eyes throughout the viewing experience, but\nby about 40 minutes in, I found myself alternately wishing the show was over\nand enthralled by how awesome the video was.\n\nTo alleviate the itching, I stopped the video a few times, loosened the\nheadset, and scratch it. That's a bit of an immersion killer.\n\n### 3\\. No coffee for you\n\nDid you know you can't drink inside a Vision Pro? To be fair, you also can't\ndrink inside of a Meta Quest 3. Basically, you can't tip the cup without it\nhitting the headset.\n\nAlso: Apple Vision Pro review: Fascinating, flawed, and needs to fix 5 things\n\nI wound up drinking my coffee through a straw, but that was also a bit of a\nproblem because I was in full VR, so finding the coffee cup was the first\nadventure, navigating the straw to my mouth the second challenge, and putting\nthe cup safely back on a surface was the third hurdle.\n\nAfter trying this once, I waited until the times I needed to scratch itches to\ntake sips. Not ideal.\n\n### 4\\. Jumpy-jump, flail, flail\n\nThere's supposed to be a people detection feature in the Vision Pro that opens\na bit of a portal if someone walks up to you and stands in front of you. But\nwhen my wife reached across the couch with an insistent tap, there was no such\nwarning.\n\nIt wasn't as much that it was startling. It was more that it took some\ncoordination and in-air finger flailing to find and stop the playback, loosen\nthe headset band, and rip the headset off my forehead, all without overly\nyanking the battery umbilical cord.\n\nI'm sure it looked ridiculous to her, and I know it was somewhat stressful to\nme.\n\n### 5\\. Oh, my furrowed brow\n\nI did notice brow pain while watching, but the entertainment experience was so\nenthralling that I put up with it. After finishing the show and safely stowing\nthe Vision Pro, I noticed that my brow, where the Vision Pro apparently\ntransferred most of its pressure, really hurt.\n\nTo be fair, it's not a terrible level of hurt, like when you stub your toe.\nBut it's painful enough that it's worth remarking about. The pain went away\nafter about ten minutes.\n\n### 6\\. In VR, nobody can hear you stream\n\nI can confirm the sense of isolation some Vision Pro reviewers have reported.\nTo be fair, I was purposely going for the isolation, because I didn't want to\nbe involved in my wife's Zoom meeting.\n\nBut when my pup came over, I could feel him and pet him, but he couldn't look\nat my face and I couldn't see him. It wasn't a terrible moment, because he has\nprodigious lap-sitting skills, but I wanted to look back at his little face\nand couldn't.\n\n## Is it worth it?\n\nThat's really two questions, isn't it? Is it worth spending $3,500+ on a\nVision Pro? And is it worth the annoyance and slight pain to watch something\nlike For All Mankind in a super-cinema environment?\n\nNo, unless you're rolling in cash, it's not worth spending $3,500 to watch TV\non a very big screen. But when this device comes down to $1,500 and is far\nmore comfortable, oh yeah. That will be the ticket.\n\nI still prefer watching TV on my TV, mostly because of the annoyances\ndescribed above. But I will dive back into this environment any time my wife\nneeds the room and I don't need to have my face buried in my computer screen.\nNow that I've watched the first two episodes of For All Mankind this way, I\nwant to watch the whole series that way.\n\nAlso: Itching to try Vision Pro's Travel Mode? Here's what to expect before\nyou go\n\nLet's put this into perspective. It feels like I have this astonishingly\nspectacular private cinema where I have the entire theatre to myself and can\nwatch almost anything I want on the huge screen. The only requirement is that\nI have to do it while wearing uncomfortable scuba goggles that also somewhat\ncompress the field of view.\n\nIt's weird, not yet perfect, and a bit uncomfortable. But it's also so very\ndamn cool.\n\nThere is no doubt this is a really awesome entertainment paradigm. I'm\nguessing some of it will get better as Apple releases new versions of its\nstill very new OS. And yeah, it's worth enduring some of the pain, and even\nthe lack of coffee accessibility, simply because the experience is just so\ninsanely great.\n\nI definitely don't advise you to run out and buy a Vision Pro just for this.\nBut if you have one, don't hesitate to set up Cinema Mode in its largest\nscreen size in the Apple TV+ app and stream some video. It'll knock your socks\noff.\n\nDo you have a Vision Pro? Have you watched anything in Immersive Cinema Mode?\nHave you seen For All Mankind?
