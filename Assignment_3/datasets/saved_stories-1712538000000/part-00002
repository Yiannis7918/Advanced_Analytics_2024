[+] Exchange Wednesday, March 27th 2024. Photo Credit: NYSE\n& Alysaa Ringler\n\nAlyssa Ringler\n\nWomen\u2019s History Month just ended. There was a lot of kumbaya and bagels for\nfemale founders \u2014 but not much else at most events hosted by funds and\ndiversity groups. (A few champions of female founders who are doing it right\nare highlighted below so keep reading.) According to Eileen Lee, founding\nPartner of Cowboy Ventures and cofounder of All Raise, while a lot has changed\nin the past few years since she coined the term \u2018unicorn,\u2019 one thing has\nstayed the same: \u201cthe lack of female founders in (VC-backed) companies.\u201d\n\nLee told FT that \u201cthe imbalance is reflected in investment flows. The share of\nfunding for companies with women-only founders declined from 2.5 percent of\nall venture funding in 2013 to 2 percent last year, according to data provider\nPitchBook. There are more founders named Michael, David, and Andrew than women\nunicorn CEOs.\u201d\n\n## A Higher Bar of Traction for Female Founders\n\nThere isn\u2019t a dearth of highly qualified female and BIPOC founders who have\nminimized team risk, market risk, and tech risk and demonstrated a product-\nmarket fit. Some female founders are rejected by VCs who don\u2019t even open their\ndecks (which are shared and tracked via DocSend), and many of these founders\ndon\u2019t even get rejected by VC firms because they cannot even get meetings to\nbe considered by VCs. We aren\u2019t given a fair shot.\n\nFemale founders are held to a much higher standard because we aren\u2019t part of\nthe VC social network and don\u2019t match a pattern of founders that it previously\nfunded. According to a Harvard Business Review case study, VCs posed different\nquestions to male and female founders: They asked men questions about the\npotential for gains and women about the potential for losses. The study found\nevidence of this bias with both male and female VCs.\n\n## Without Measurement, There\u2019s No Progress\n\nPeter Drucker famously said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t measure it, you can\u2019t improve it.\u201d\nMany VC funds and diversity groups host events but don\u2019t bother measuring the\noutcomes of their efforts. Meanwhile, they expect traction, progress, and\nrevenue from founders. It\u2019s time we held them to the same standards. The\nventure capital industry still has a glaring gender and racial diversity\nproblem. VCs aren\u2019t utilizing tech to level the playing field despite having\naccess to technology. Many VCs track their heart rate, stress, sleep, and\ncalories burned with wearables to optimize their health. Why can\u2019t they start\nmeasuring their diversity efforts? How many female founders did they talk to\nat their events? How many meetings do they have with female founders monthly?\nHow many did they invest in? They should be asking themselves these questions.\n\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR\n\n### Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\n\nBy\n\nKevin Payne\n\nContributor\n\n### Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\n\nBy\n\nCassidy Horton\n\nContributor\n\n## Performative Activism: A Lack of Thoughtfulness and Sincerity\n\nVC funds and diversity groups should be more intentional with their efforts.\nIf you want to help female founders, curate an audience with female founders\nand investors. Create content that\u2019s not remedial. For example, if you\u2019re\nhosting an event and calling it Women in Generative AI, bring in some\nsuperstar founders or execs from top tech companies as speakers whom we can\nlearn from. When we take time out of our day to attend an event, we don\u2019t just\nwant a free bagel or glass of wine and to mingle among women. We deserve more.\nWe deserve an honest meeting, feedback, intros, and support. Sadly,\nperformative activism \u2014 e.g., hiring diverse non-investment partners and\nunder-tracking diversity KPIs \u2014 have resulted no improvement of funding going\nto underrepresented founders, according to VC Human Capital Survey.\n\nSeveral female founders I interviewed after recent female founder events in\nNYC complained that the events are often hosted by a fund, but none of their\ninvesting partners show up. This is frustrating because that\u2019s usually the\nmain reason they go to the event. Meanwhile, many have said that of the female\nfounder-focused funds can be exclusionary beyond their own network of female\nportfolio founders. They project that they democratize access, but they are\nexclusionary. If a startup isn\u2019t a fit for a fund, VCs can still give brief\nfeedback or make an intro.\n\n## Diversity Funds Aren\u2019t Enough\n\nTo create a paradigm shift, VCs should lead all stakeholders in the tech\necosystem by example. They must pay attention to the role they have played and\nthe work they must do to support social justice. It\u2019s time that VCs show us\ntheir traction.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nTo create a paradigm shift, VCs should lead all stakeholders in the tech\necosystem by example. They must pay attention to the role they have played and\nthe work they must do to support social justice. It\u2019s time that VCs show us\ntheir traction.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that small diversity funds started by large funds such\nas Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s Diversity Fund and Softbank\u2019s Opportunity Fund are\njust a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of venture capital allocated\nper year to multibillion-dollar generalist funds. Even if there were 10\nSoftbank Opportunity Funds, that would only amount to 1.5 percent of the $66.9\nbillion raised by U.S. venture capital funds in 2023.\n\nIf VC funds really want to see a paradigm shift, they need to do more than\ncreate small diversity funds. They need to be more transparent. If they need\nhelp improving their diversity KPIs, they should partner with community\nleaders of Supermomos and The AI Furnace.\n\n## Champions Getting It Right: VC OpenDoor, Supermomos & AI Furnace\n\n## VC OpenDoor\n\nAlgorithmic startup/VC matching portal VC OpenDoor helps facilitate less\nbiased deal flow pipelines. It makes the fundraising process more efficient,\nsince it filters according to type of business, stage, and sector. The portal\nscales with time, volume of deals, and across VC specialists and geographies,\nthough it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that while some VCs are using it earnestly\nwith intent to increase diversity, some don\u2019t deliver on meetings once VC\nOpenDoor matches them with founders.\n\n## Supermomos\n\nEdwina Yeo founded Supermomos (the name is an ode to her grandmother whom she\ncalls Momo) to create meaningful connections among men and women in the\necosystem and to improve the skewed ratio of female business leaders and\nfounders. Her prior experience as a former VC at Tiger Global and a startup\nfounder equipped her with insights and access to founders, VCs, tech\nexecutives that a typical community manager at a VC fund may lack. Yeo has\nmade a conscious effort for mixed gender founder events to have a 50/50 mix of\nmen and women. She says, \u201cThere are many women out there doing incredible\nthings, and we are conscious to spotlight these great business leaders and\nfounders and inspire others in the community.\u201d At Supermomos\u2019 recent Women\u2019s\nLeadership Summit at the NYSE, Supermomos featured an all-female speaker\nlineup, including the former Chairman of LVMH USA who was also former MD at\nThe Carlyle Group, a serial entrepreneur, and the 7th woman to found and IPO a\ncompany on the NYSE, and an exited unicorn founder.\n\nYeo noticed that at AI & ML events female representation is even worse than\ngeneral tech events, usually with a 90/10 male to female ratio. Accordingly,\nat Supermomos\u2019 Super AI ML Summit, Yeo curated a crowd in which 40% of\nspeakers and attendees were women in AI, including the Head of Data at Moet\nHennessy, the Head of Design at NVIDIA, a Partner at Two Sigma Ventures, and\nthe former Head of Sales Strategy at Scale AI. Yeo believes that \u201cwhile there\nis room for female communities, it is also important to have truly mix-\ngendered communities of professionals in similar functions or industries, as\nboth exist in the real world and bring their own unique perspectives and can\nbe strong allies for each other.\u201d\n\nSupermomos tightly curates its speakers, programming, and attendees to make\nsure that everyone feels like they are in a room of peers. They host groups\nand events with the goal of facilitating knowledge exchange and intimate\nconnections among peers, or professionals within one to two levels of each\nother. They use their proprietary AI platform to facilitate this curation and\nshowcase demographic statistics to cohosts to encourage diversity among\nattendees. Supermomos also hosts a monthly Female Founders and Funders Series\nwhich features a female founder and/or Senior VC Partner. These events are\nmore intimate with the goal of giving founders access and giving VCs broader\nexposure to female founders.\n\n## AI Furnace\n\nThe AI Furnace is one of fastest growing AI founder, builder, and researcher\ncommunities in the world. It was founded by Angela Mascarenas and Hamza\nZaveri, who are AI founders themselves, to support AI founders and operators\nbuilding startups locally in cities outside of San Francisco. Since starting 7\nmonths ago, they\u2019ve grown to over 12,000 members internationally and have\nchapters in NYC, London, Paris, Dubai, and Boston. They host events to\nshowcase local AI innovations and to support AI founders including AI Demo\nDays, Founder/AI Talent Mixers, AI Happy Hours, Fireside Chats with AI\nExecutives, Founder/Funder Dinners, and Coworking Days for founders.\n\nPower Women in AI event hosted by AI Furnace, March 19, 2024.\n\nAI Furnace\n\nCo-founder Angela Mascarenas, who is also the co-founder of Vokel AI, decided\nto launch The AI Furnace because she believes that \u201ccommunity is just as\nimportant as infrastructure (just as much as foundation models are\ninfrastructure) for AI innovation. Founders and builders in this era need\ncommunity and a peer network to build in such a rapidly evolving space.\u201d\n\nMascarenas noticed during demo days that female founders were reluctant to\nshowcase their products in AI Furnace Demo Days because they were worried\ntheir products weren\u2019t perfect. Meanwhile, male founders were showcasing bare-\nbone demos and without worry. Accordingly, AI Furnace has made a concerted\neffort to feature female founders in AI to present at demo days and to speak\non panels. AI Furnace recently hosted a Power Women in AI Summit, with an all-\nstar female speaker lineup including the founder of Care.com, the former Chief\nAI Officer of Estee Lauder, a serial CTO/CPO, and 2 seed stage female AI\nfounders. Mascarenas said, \u201cThe main goal of the event was to flip the script\nand to celebrate the successes of senior women in AI in order to show other\nwomen that it\u2019s possible to succeed in AI, whether that\u2019s on the startup path\nor the corporate track.\u201d\n\nThe AI Furnace is making diversity and inclusion a core part of its DNA and is\nlaunching a nonprofit side of the organization to increase diversity and\ncreate windows into AI for women and diverse founders. Mascarenas says that\n\u201cAs AI becomes a core underlying technology driving the world, the researchers\nwho are training the models and the founders who are innovating should be\ndiverse. We firmly believe that women and people of color need to participate\nin this step change, and not just the elite, to create a safer AI-driven\nfuture.\u201d\n\n## The Missed Opportunity\n\nFunding diverse founders isn\u2019t charity. White male founders with crazy ideas\nare often seen as visionaries while diverse founders are seen as charity\ncases. As a result of their exclusivity, many VCs don\u2019t even try to comprehend\nsome of the problems our startups are trying to solve. Ultimately, this\ncreates blind spots.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nFunding diverse founders isn\u2019t charity. White male founders with crazy ideas\nare often seen as visionaries while diverse founders are seen as charity\ncases.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nDr. Pinkey Patel, founder of Myri Health, a virtual postpartum care platform,\nsays a male investor once told her that \u201cpostpartum is niche\u201d and opted not to\ninvest. Since then, Patel completed Techstars and is now part of Google for\nWomen Founders accelerator. Many male VCs have little understanding of\nproducts and services that women-founded businesses market to other women and\nthe problems they are solving for. They don\u2019t even want to take the time to\nlearn, take a meeting, or look at our pitch decks. In one instance, a male VC\ntold a female founder with an AI-enabled fashion tech SaaS company that he\ndoesn\u2019t understand that sector; even though his fund likes AI-enabled SaaS\nbusinesses. \u201cThis presents an arbitrage opportunity,\u201d said Andrea Turner\nMoffitt, founder of Future Heights Ventures and co-founder of another VC firm,\nPlum Alley Investments. This is why \u201cless than 2 percent of VC funding goes\ninto women\u2019s health. There is a mismatch,\u201d says Naseem Sayani, co-founder of\nEmmeline Ventures.\n\nA recent Boston Consulting Group survey of 350 start-ups found that female\nfounded startups deliver more than twice as much revenue per dollar invested\nthan those founded by men. Female founders also burn through cash at a slower\npace and exit sooner at a higher rate than male founders, according to\nPitchBook. At Supermomos\u2019 recent Private Founders Dinner for a curated group\nof founders that have $10-100 million in revenue or funding raised, Yeo\nobserved that there were significantly more profitable companies run by women\nthan men.\n\nVC funds should consider collaborating with groups like Supermomos and AI\nFurnace or giving its founders Venture Partner or Advisor roles for deal flow\nor feedback. Companies like Perkins Coie, an international law firm, and\nJustworks, a payroll tech unicorn, have been sponsoring female founder\ninitiatives. Other law firms, startup banks, and companies serving founders\nshould also support them.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMany VCs overlooked Melanie Perkins when she was fundraising. She didn\u2019t fit\nthe pattern they are used to. She was a female founder with a non-technical\nbackground and a college dropout. Perkins said that 100 Silicon Valley\ninvestors rejected her before she finally got a bite.\n\nA female founder may have insane drive, deep domain expertise, the perfect\nnetwork in their industry to scale her business, but she may struggle to get\nnetworked in the VC community. Dear VCs, how are you going to find the next\nMelanie Perkins if you aren\u2019t open to meeting more female founders, hearing\nabout their companies or looking at their decks?\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\n\nSindhya Valloppillil\n\nSindhya is the Founder & CEO of Skin Dossier, an AI-enabled Precision Skin\nHealth (SaaS) company.
