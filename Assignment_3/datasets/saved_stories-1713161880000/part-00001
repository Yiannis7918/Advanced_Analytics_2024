Police say that\u2019s because of the\nport\u2019s strategic location and large container volume. And while authorities\nsay they are doing what they can to stop the scourge of auto theft, experts\nsay jurisdictional limitations, a lack of personnel, and organized crime are\nstanding in the way.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\n  * Exclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay, Rex Murphy and others.

With rail and road links to the Greater Toronto Area \u2014\nwhere many vehicles are stolen \u2014 Montreal\u2019s port is \u201cconveniently located\u201d for\ncriminals.\n\nA Ontario Provincial Police investigator for more than 20 years, Gast said\nstolen vehicles are packed in shipping containers in the Toronto area, given\nfalsified paperwork, including customs declarations stating the cargo is\nlegitimate, and then shipped to the port by rail or truck.\n\nGast\u2019s organization participated in Project Vector, the Ontario Provincial\nPolice-led operation at the port that recovered 598 stolen vehicles between\nDecember and March.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\n  1.

One car stolen every 40 minutes in Toronto last year, police chief says\n\nAside from its location, the sheer volume of merchandise moving through the\nport is exploited by criminals. Last year, around 1.7 million containers\ntransited through the Port of Montreal, including 70 per cent of Canada\u2019s\nlegal vehicle exports, according to port authorities. That\u2019s around a million\nmore containers than Canada\u2019s next two largest East Coast ports combined.\n\nNP Posted\n\nGet a dash of perspective along with the trending news of the day in a very\nreadable format.\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia\nNetwork Inc.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nA welcome email is on its way.

As well, he said, police should be able to enter\ncustoms-controlled areas of those facilities without a warrant or special\npermission from the CBSA.\n\n\u201cPeople will have tracking devices in their cars, they\u2019ll track them to the\nintermodal hub, or track them to the port and local police can\u2019t even go on\nand do anything about it,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring Project Vector, Peel Police said their access to containers at the port\nwas restricted by CBSA\u2019s \u201cvery limited resources,\u201d Cst. Tyler Bell-Morena\nwrote in an email.\n\nThe CBSA wouldn\u2019t say what percentage of containers are scanned every year,\nbut Annie Beausejour, the agency\u2019s regional director general for Quebec, said\nall containers flagged by police are inspected by border agents.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n\u201cWe would like to be able to scan all the containers leaving the country;\nunfortunately, this is not something realistic,\u201d she said in an interview,\nadding that the border agency isn\u2019t allowed to slow the flow of trade.\n\nSo far this year, the CBSA has seized 300 stolen vehicles from Toronto-area\nrail yards, and in 2023 it recovered 1,200 stolen vehicles at the Montreal\nport.\n\nBut port interceptions are a \u201clast resort,\u201d she said, adding that it\u2019s\nimportant to recover stolen vehicles before they reach the shipping docks.\n\nThat\u2019s because once a container filled with stolen cars reaches the Port of\nMontreal, there aren\u2019t enough border guards to check it, according to the\nunion representing border officers. In fact, last February, there were just\neight border officers working at the port, and the agency lacked space to hold\nmore than six recovered stolen vehicles at a time, union president Mark Weber\nrecently told a parliamentary committee.\n\nThe lack of resources in Montreal is typical of port cities worldwide, said\nAnna Sergi, a criminology professor at the University of Essex in the United\nKingdom who studies organized crime, in a recent interview.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCustoms agencies are \u201cfocused on import. No one is focused on export. Export\nis not a viable thing to invest in because it\u2019s someone else\u2019s problem,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cThe only country that does a little bit, and just a little bit, of\ninvestigation on exports is the United States\u201d\n\nSergi, who wrote about stolen vehicle exports from Montreal in a 2020 report\non corruption and criminality at seaports, said only two or three per cent of\ninbound containers are inspected, and the percentage is even lower for those\nleaving the country.\n\nOrganized crime has long been present on Montreal\u2019s waterfront, she said. The\nWest End Gang, Montreal\u2019s so-called \u201cIrish mafia,\u201d as well as the Italian\nmafia have both been involved in drug importation using corrupt customs agents\nand port workers.\n\nInsp. Dominique Cote of the Montreal police said \u201cwe have no information that\nleads us to believe that the Port of Montreal has been infiltrated by\norganized crime, or that that\u2019s the reason these vehicles are found in\nMontreal.\u201d\n\nBrown said he\u2019s skeptical of claims that border agents can\u2019t do more \u2014 or that\norganized crime isn\u2019t part of the reason Montreal\u2019s port is so popular with\ncriminals.\n\n\u201cWhen I see CBSA and the Port of Montreal say why they can\u2019t do it, it makes\nme highly suspicious of why they\u2019re defending a status quo that has been the\nmost lucrative gift to organized crime in Canadian history,\u201d he said.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 14, 2024.\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops,\nlongreads and provocative commentary.
