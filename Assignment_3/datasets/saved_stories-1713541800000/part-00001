If you want to scoop me, or investigate\nthe data yourself, you can download the answers of the 5500 people who agreed\nto have their responses shared publicly. Out of concern for anonymity, the\npublic dataset will exclude or bin certain questions2. If you want more\ncomplete information, email me and explain why, and I\u2019ll probably send it to\nyou.\n\nDownload the public data (.xlsx, .csv)\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in tracking how some of these answers have changed over\ntime, you might also enjoy reading the 2022 or 2020 survey results.\n\n1\n\nI can\u2019t make Google Forms only present data from people who agreed to make\ntheir responses public, so I\u2019ve deleted everything identifiable on the\nindividual level, eg your written long response answers. Everything left is\njust things like \u201cX% of users are Canadian\u201d or \u201cY% of users have ADHD\u201d.\nThere\u2019s no way to put these together and identify an ADHD Canadian, so I don\u2019t\nthink they\u2019re privacy relevant. If you think you\u2019ve found something\nidentifiable on the public results page, please let me know.\n\n2\n\nI deleted email address, some written long answers, some political questions\nthat people might get in trouble for answering honestly, and some sex-related\nquestions. I binned age to the nearest 10 years and deleted the finer-grained\nethnicity question. I binned all incomes above $1,000,000 into \u201chigh\u201d, and\nremoved all countries that had fewer than ten respondents (eg if you said you\nwere from Madagascar, it would have made you identifiable, so I deleted that).\nIf you need this information for some reason, email me.\n\n### Subscribe to Astral Codex Ten\n\nBy Scott Alexander\n\nP(A|B) = [P(A)*P(B|A)]/P(B), all the rest is commentary.\n\n9 Likes\n\n9\n\nShare this post\n\n#### ACX Survey Results 2024\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n9\n\nShare\n\nShare this discussion\n\n#### ACX Survey Results 2024\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n9 Comments\n\n  * New First\n  * Chronological\n\nNolan Eoghan (not a robot)1 hr agoIt\u2019s a pity that the full question is not\nalways presented on the charts. So it\u2019s just Speech and some bar charts from\n1-5.(Presumably in that case given the audience and 1 was the plurality, 1 was\nfull free speech and 5 restricted but it\u2019s not clear).Expand full commentReply\n(1)Share  \n---  \n  \nScott Alexander53 mins agoAuthorAbove the link to the results is a link to\n\"See the full questions for the ACX survey\"; if I'm understanding your concern\nright, that should solve it.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nNolan Eoghan (not a robot)51 mins agoThanks.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nMakinRecord Crash49 mins agoFunny how the love question breaks the bell curve\nand just looks binary, presumably because you're only very upset if you're\ngetting nothing and happy if you get anything at all, with minor variations\nbeyond that.Expand full commentReply (1)Share  \n---  \n  \nMelvin28 mins agoThe anxiety question is also interestingly bimodal.\nApparently everybody thinks of themselves as either unusually anxious or\nunusually relaxed, very few people see themselves as being averagely anxious.I\nwould have thought that I'm unusually relaxed, but looking at this data makes\nme suspect that I'm actually averagely anxious.

What is your life like? How many partners did you\nhave to get through until you reached the rank of grand master of sex? (At\nleast I would hope that someone with over 1k partners would be a gm of sex,\ngotta make all that grinding count for something!)Expand full commentReply\n(1)Share  \n---  \n  \nIan Crandell42 mins agoThis must be that ranked competitive sex I've heard all\nabout.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nshacklesburst15 mins agoThe reading comprehension clearly took a nosedive at\nthe internet hours per day other than for work question, given the amount of\nanswers that are >24.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nmimi9 mins agoCould you change the data download links?
