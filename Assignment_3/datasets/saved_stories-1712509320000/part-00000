In early 2022, a GR Yaris with two pedals made an appearance at\nthe Toyota Gazoo Rally Racing Challenge held in Japan. Shortly after its first\nouting, the automaker announced plans to speed up development. It was most\nrecently tested in September at an event part of the Super Taikyu series. It's\nstill not available to buy but Akio Toyoda suggests it will be well worth the\nwait.\n\nAs part of the same interview with Toyota Times magazine during which he\nhinted at a revival of the Celica, the company's chairman praised the upcoming\nslushbox. Known by its official name as the \"Direct Automatic Transmission,\"\nthe new DAT \"will be a game-changer for automatics.\" However, it's likely not\ncoming out anytime soon as the ex-Toyota President and CEO said \"many hurdles\nremain.\"\n\n### 2020 Toyota GR Yaris\n\n24 Photos\n\nprevnext\n\nThe former head honcho went on to say: \"I really want to make this happen, and\nfor many people to drive these cars. For instance, those who only drive\nautomatic could enjoy motorsports. They can experience the different sounds\nand the sensation of downshifting and upshifting.\" He jokingly mentioned DAT\nalso stands for \"Dat's Akio Toyoda!\"\n\nAkio Toyoda says he's losing precious time whenever he's shifting gears in the\nGR Yaris race car with the manual transmission but that wouldn't be the case\nwith an auto-equipped version. With DAT, \"there\u2019s no time lost when shifting\"\nand he can focus on accelerating, braking, and steering.\n\nIt's too soon to say whether Toyota intends to offer the DAT on other GR-\nbadged models. As a refresher, the GR 86 is optionally available with a six-\nspeed auto while the GR Corolla comes exclusively with a clutch pedal. The GR\nSupra can be had with an eight-speed engineered by ZF but adapted for the BMW\nZ4-based coupe.\n\nWhich GR For You?\n\nToyota GR Corolla Circuit Edition Returns For 2024 With New Blue Paint\n\nToyota GR Supra Lightweight Debuts In Europe With Substantial Diet And 6MT\n\nSource: Toyota\n\n++\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Share on Flipboard\n  * Pin It\n  * Share on Reddit\n  * Share on WhatsApp\n  * Send to email\n\nJoin the conversation 0 Comments / 0 New\n\nGot a tip for us?
