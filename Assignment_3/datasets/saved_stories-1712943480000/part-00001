IBM, right.\n\nWe\u2019ve used capital expenditures (CAPEX) to separate the clouds from the clowns\nfor over a decade. Clouds consume copious CAPEX. Clowns confabulate.\n\nIt is time for another inspection tour of Clown City (previous visits: 2018,\n2020, 2022). Once a bustling stop on the cloud-washing promotional circuit,\nClown City is now but a shadow of its former self. Remember (colorfully\nbewigged) visitors like Cisco Cloud, HPE Helion, Rackspace, Verizon Cloud, and\nVMware Cloud? They all eventually learned \u2013 the hard way \u2013 that clouds are\nbuilt with CAPEX, not chatter.\n\nSadly, a once-promising new generation of potential clowns never rose to the\noccasion of repopulating Clown City and entertaining us with the gap between\ntheir cloud rhetoric and their CAPEX spending.\n\nThe only activity left on the sleepy streets of Clown City is the CAPEX Clown\nCar Race between the last two of our self-proclaimed cloud pretenders: IBM and\nOracle. It is time to declare a winner in this (admittedly bush league) race!\n\nThe CAPEX Clown Car Race checkered flag marks the end of the cloud-washing\nera. But clown fans should not despair. Clowns are eternal. The First Law of\nClownodynamics says clownishness is neither created nor destroyed.\n\nThere are always companies cloaking themselves in the new hotness without\npossessing the proper prerequisites for participation. When the hotness moves,\nso do the clowns.\n\nBut some domains require real investment, which means the all-seeing-eye of\nCAPEX still exposes poseurs.\n\nHello AI clowns! Welcome to Platformonomics ClownWatchTM\n\nCAPEX might be an even better tell in AI than it was with cloud, because GPUs\nain\u2019t cheap and software now has COGS (a development which may prove\nregrettable).\n\nBut first, we have a drag race approaching the finish line.\n\n## The CAPEX Clown Car Race\n\nOracle got off to a very poor start in our race, with Larry Ellison\nharrumphing about cloud computing:\n\n> Maybe I\u2019m an idiot, but I have no idea what anyone is talking about. What is\n> it? It\u2019s complete gibberish. It\u2019s insane. When is this idiocy going to\n> stop?\u201d\n\nEventually Oracle got cloud religion after some embarrassing but certainly not\nunexpected attempts to substitute hot air for CAPEX. Nothing motivates like\nlosing half your database market share.\n\nThrough 2022 it even looked like Oracle might be serious in the only way that\nmatters: up-and-to-the-right CAPEX spending.\n\nBut 2023 saw a catastrophic 27% drop in Oracle\u2019s CAPEX spending. While their\nabsolute and directional spending is both disappointing and probably\ndisastrous, it doesn\u2019t matter because their opponent in the CAPEX Clown Car\nRace is IBM (company motto: \u201cDown and to the right\u201d).\n\nThere is a deeply philosophical question in how you win a clown car race. Is\nthe winner the most clowny or the least clowny? With next to no consideration,\nwe\u2019re going with the latter and calling a winner.\n\nCongratulations Oracle \u2013 based on your CAPEX, you\u2019re the cloudiest of the\nclowns! But Oracle is still a clown, and certainly not a hyperscale cloud\n(there is no \u201cbig four\u201d despite the best efforts of Oracle PR to slip away\nfrom the children\u2019s table).\n\nAnd IBM gets a clowniest clown participation trophy. IBM \u2014 I\u2019ve always\nbelieved you could do this!\n\nBelow we\u2019ll look at IBM and Oracle\u2019s CAPEX spending, amuse ourselves with the\ncurrent fairy tales they\u2019re telling, ask what is going on at Oracle, and then\nmake the brutal comparison with the CAPEX boomtown of Cloud City. And we\u2019ll\nend with a quick \u201cwhere are they now\u201d look at that once-promising new\ngeneration of aspiring clowns.\n\n##### Get Updates By Email\n\n## IBM\n\nCompany motto: \u201cDown and to the Right\u201d\n\nIn what is not even remotely a surprise, IBM hit new record lows in 2023 for\nboth absolute CAPEX spending and CAPEX spending as a percentage of revenue.\nThe hypers of \u201chybrid cloud\u201d cut CAPEX by 20%, spending less than $1.5 billion\n(across the entire company, not just cloud infrastructure), which is less than\nhalf of what they spent as recently as 2020.\n\nThese numbers confirm there is no cloud in \u201chybrid cloud\u201d. Like soylent green,\n\u201chybrid cloud\u201d is people \u2013 consultants (and mostly offshore consultants).\nThere is no cloud business at IBM (as we have been saying for over a decade).\n\nIn perhaps related news, the leader of IBM Cloud quietly departed for another\nIT consulting company (one that doesn\u2019t pretend to be a platform company).\n\nBut don\u2019t shed too many tears for IBM. The company is in the midst of a bold\nstrategic transformation. A transformation from a cloud to an AI . Because the\nabsence of CAPEX in either domain ensures you are a .\n\nMeet the new shell game. Same as the old shell game.\n\nIBM is now running its cloud playbook for AI. The company opened their Q4 2023\nearnings release wanting you to think they are a generative AI company:\n\n> \u201cIn the fourth quarter, we grew revenue in all of our segments, driven by\n> continued adoption of our hybrid cloud and AI offerings. Client demand for\n> AI is accelerating and our book of business for watsonx and generative AI\n> roughly doubled from the third to the fourth quarter,\u201d said Arvind Krishna,\n> IBM chairman and chief executive officer.\n\nYou\u2019d almost think IBM was seeing material revenue from AI. But when asked to\n\u201celaborate specifically on exactly what the book of business means\u201d by a\nveteran Wall Street analyst familiar with IBM\u2019s antics, much bobbing and\nweaving ensues:\n\n> So Toni, on the AI book of business, this is not all revenue in the quarter.\n> I would just begin with that statement to set it straight. At this stage, we\n> wanted to start looking at what is our momentum, what is the sentiment from\n> our clients. So we went to a measure that is more reflective of, I\u2019ll use\n> the word signings. What is the commitment the clients are making to us?\n> Consulting is straightforward. It is the signings. Consulting signings are\n> anywhere from 12 to 24 months on average is how much time they play out over\n> there. And on software, it\u2019s what they\u2019re committing to. And we are using\n> SaaS ACV. So it\u2019s a 12-month commitment, which is typical for as a service\n> as well as, since we do offer our portfolio both ways as license or as a\n> service, it includes the license piece as well. Now over a long-term, let\u2019s\n> call it a couple of years or more, yes, the book of business should turn\n> into an amount of revenue in a quarter, but that\u2019s going to take a bit of\n> time to catch up. But we felt that this gives the better indicator right now\n> of what is our traction and what is our acceleration in that part of the\n> business.\n\nThis is the same game IBM played for cloud. Chant the buzzwords and hope\ninvestors won\u2019t notice the company isn\u2019t actually investing and doesn\u2019t have\ncompetitive products.\n\nAs they did with cloud, IBM\u2019s AI numbers are not something they actually\nreport to the SEC, yet lead with in investor communications. I don\u2019t know if\nthat is securities fraud, but I know IBM has no GPUs.\n\n## Oracle\n\nCompany motto: \u201cThat\u2019s Not Just a Rack, It\u2019s an Entire Region\u201d\n\nData note: we do Oracle a solid by comparing their March 2023 through February\n2024 (FYQ4 to FYQ3) results to the 2023 calendar year results of other\ncompanies. This lets Oracle bring a full two months from their glorious future\nto the comps. Hopefully that doesn\u2019t give them too unfair an advantage.\n\nWhen we last checked in on the database vampire, we noted they were (finally)\nramping their CAPEX:\n\n> Oracle, on the other hand, is at long last starting to put its money where\n> its mouth has been (though the mouth\u2019s lead looks insurmountable). The\n> database vampire doubled their annual CAPEX spend in the last year (using\n> their March 2021 through February 2022 results). The company promised to\n> spend $4 billion in CAPEX in FY22 and it looks like will hit that mark by\n> May. And they surpassed IBM in annual CAPEX spending this year.\n\nBut after spending more than $8 billion in our ersatz calendar 2022, Oracle\nhas fallen off the CAPEX wagon. Oracle CAPEX declined 27% to under $6 billion\nfrom 2022 to 2023.\n\nOracle\u2019s commentary in the last several quarters has (commendably!) focused on\nCAPEX, with the CAPEX discussion taking up more time in each successive\nconference call. Oracle repeatedly tells us they have \u201cenormous\u201d cloud demand,\nare capacity constrained, and are building out data centers incredibly fast.\nBut something has gone off the rails in Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure build-\nout because their CAPEX spending has declined by double digits in each of the\nlast three quarters.\n\nIn FY23 Q1 (Sept 2023), Oracle says:\n\n> Because we have far more demand than we can supply, our biggest challenge is\n> building data centers as quickly as possible.\n>\n> Capital expenditures were $8.3 billion over the last four quarters and we\n> are clearly beginning to see the cash flow benefits stemming from our cloud\n> transformation. CapEx was $1.3 billion in Q1 as we continue to build\n> capacity for bookings and our customers\u2019 growing needs.\n>\n> Given the demand we have and see in the pipeline, I expect that fiscal year\n> 2024 CapEx will be similar to this past year\u2019s CapEx.\n\nYet Oracle CAPEX for FYQ1 was down 24%. And they reiterate the guidance to\nspend $8+ billion in FY24 CAPEX (ending May 2024).\n\nIn FY2024 Q2 (Dec 2023), Oracle told us:\n\n> The demand for Oracle\u2019s Cloud Infrastructure and Generative AI is\n> consistently increasing quarter after quarter.\n>\n> We have to build 100 additional cloud data centers because there are\n> billions of dollars more in contracted demand than we currently can supply.\n> Cloud Infrastructure demand is huge and growing at an unprecedented rate.\n>\n> CapEx was $1.1 billion in Q2 as we continue to build capacity for bookings\n> and our customers\u2019 growing needs. Given the enormity of our pipeline and\n> backlog, I expect CapEx will be somewhere around $8 billion this fiscal\n> year, meaning our second half CapEx will be considerably higher as we bring\n> online more capacity.\n\nYet Q2 CAPEX was down 56% and the lowest spend in eight quarters. And they\nslightly reduce guidance for the fiscal year ending in May 2024 to $8 billion.\n\nBy FY2024 Q3 CAPEX discussion dominated their conference call remarks (as it\nshould in all calls):\n\n> Where if not for some continuing supply constraints, consumption growth\n> would have been even higher.\n>\n> Now while we spent $2.1 billion on CapEx this quarter, the $1.7 billion in\n> the cash-flow statements is slightly lower just due to the timing of\n> payments. So the $2.1 billion is actually what we spent and will pay for.\n>\n> We are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity built out\n> given the enormity of our backlog and pipeline. I expect the CapEx will be\n> somewhere around $7 billion to $7.5 billion this fiscal year, meaning our Q4\n> CapEx should be considerably higher.\n>\n> We have enormous amounts of demand. I tried to make that clear last quarter,\n> and we have more capacity coming online. But we have tried to \u2013 we\u2019re trying\n> to focus on much larger chunks of data center capacities and electricity and\n> all of that and that\u2019s just \u2013 that all to come.\n>\n> Let me add that Oracle has been building data centers at a record level and\n> a lot of people I think are aware that we can build fairly small data\n> centers to get started when we want to.\n>\n> We can go very small. We can get a full cloud data center with Ultra\n> services in 10 racks.\n>\n> But this is what I want to point out. We\u2019re also building the largest data\n> centers in the world that we know of. We\u2019re building an AI data center in\n> the United States where you could park eight Boeing 747s nose-to-tail in\n> that one data center. So, we are building large numbers of data centers, and\n> we were \u2013 and some of those data centers are smallish, but some of those\n> data centers are the largest AI data centers in the world.\n>\n> So, we\u2019re bringing on enormous amounts of capacity over the next 24 months\n> because the demand is so high, we need to do that to satisfy our existing\n> set of customers.\n>\n> So, for fiscal year \u201925, looking at about $10 billion in CapEx because it\u2019s\n> also involves not only some big centers, but it also involves expansions of\n> existing centers. So we\u2019ve already got some areas that we will be filling\n> out. So at least preliminarily, we\u2019re looking at $10 billion for next year.\n> And then it\u2019s not too complicated to figure out the math here when I\u2019m\n> looking at somewhere between $7 billion and $7.5 billion for the full year\n> and you\u2019ve got all the numbers for one, two, and three at this point.\n>\n> And I would include for Q3 the one we just are announcing. I would add in\n> the amount we haven\u2019t paid yet as the CapEx number for this quarter. Okay?\n> And then I guess that would be and then Larry gets the second question. But\n> anyway, so $2.1 billion for this quarter and you\u2019ve got Q1 and Q2 and I\u2019m\n> going to be somewhere between $7 billion and $7.5 billion for the full year,\n> which is actually a little bit lower than I thought. But we were able to do\n> pretty well. You know-how we spend very carefully.\n>\n> So, there is a tremendous amount of demand, the data centers take longer to\n> build, and we would like that said, we are getting very good at building\n> them quickly and getting the building the power and the communication links\n> in, we\u2019re doing faster than we have ever happened in the past.\n>\n> It\u2019s very different than it used to be. So, we\u2019re able to bring additional\n> capacity online very quickly if we have that the electric power and the\n> communication lines. So, is the long pole in the tent is actually building\n> the structure, connecting the electricity, connecting the communication\n> lines.\n\nDespite claiming they\u2019re building data centers \u201cat a record level\u201d, Q3 CAPEX\nwas down 36%. They strangely want credit for more CAPEX spending than what\nthey reported to SEC (again, securities fraud questions are not addressed\nhere). And Larry tried to distract with a soliloquy on how many 747s would fit\nin a future Oracle data center (when you only fly private, you may not realize\nairlines don\u2019t fly 747s any more).\n\nGuidance for the full fiscal year CAPEX spend has come down by over a billion\ndollars. The lower target still requires a huge ramp in Q4, and roughly\ndoubling spending from Q3. But most of all, we see the first acknowledge of\nconstraints on data centers build-outs, in particular electron availability.\n\nAnd this double-digit CAPEX decline occurs amidst the AI frenzy, a trend\nOracle, of course, claims to be leading. 2023 was an odd year to slash\ninfrastructure investment if you\u2019re big in AI (or say you are).\n\nThe fundamental question about Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure ambitions is does\nthe company just not know how to build data centers with more than a couple\nracks or have they concluded they don\u2019t want to (or can\u2019t) spend the kind of\nmoney this game requires?\n\nOracle has been on a very public cloud scale learning curve. First they\npretended they didn\u2019t need much CAPEX because, of course, Oracle\u2019s stuff was\njust so much better than anyone else\u2019s.\n\nThen they won a fraction of Zoom\u2019s cloud business, hyped it in time-honored\nOracle fashion, and were humbled when they couldn\u2019t fulfill the \u201cextreme\u201d\ncapacity demanded.\n\nWhile it is cute that Oracle counts a single rack as a data center and ten\nracks is a \u201cUltra\u201d data center, the hyperclouds operate at many orders of\nmagnitude greater scale. Oracle is now trying to transition beyond bonsai data\ncenters and seems to be struggling with the concrete and steel world of data\ncenters (with their need for building permits, connectivity and power).\n\nNo doubt Oracle will someday learn why hyperclouds are building smaller data\ncenters and not 747 hangars.\n\nThe hyperclouds have decades of experience building cloud-scale data centers\nat this point. They manage multi-year lead times and are deeply engaged in the\n\u201cmad scramble\u201d for power, which is the biggest constraint for data centers\ntoday.\n\nOracle is now guiding to a FY25 CAPEX spend of \u2013 gasp \u2014 $10 billion, but given\ntheir recent inability to actually spend to their guidance, that may still be\noptimistic.\n\nThe other possibility is Oracle is having second thoughts about the financial\nhit associated with transforming an asset-light software company into a\nserious cloud infrastructure player. In 2022, Oracle\u2019s CAPEX as a percentage\nof revenue hit 18%, comparable to what hyperclouds can spend. But that spend\nalso came with a roughly $2 billion profit hit. They quickly reined in that\npercentage by over a third in 2023.\n\nBut the financial issue isn\u2019t just the impact on Oracle profits. Tragically,\nthey aren\u2019t actually competing with fellow clown car IBM. They\u2019re competing\nwith Amazon, Google and Microsoft and must soberly contemplate their financial\nwherewithal to play in that league.\n\nFor all of Oracle\u2019s ramp in CAPEX in recent years, they are over $150 billion\nbehind cumulative hypercloud spending. And they are falling further and\nfurther behind with every passing quarter. In 2023, AWS spent $24.8 billion on\nCAPEX (over four times Oracle), Google spent $32.3 billion (over five times\nOracle), and Microsoft $41.2 billion (almost seven times Oracle). Microsoft\nspent more on CAPEX in just 2023 than Oracle has in its entire nearly 50 year\nhistory.\n\nOracle\u2019s $10 billion in CAPEX guidance for FY25 adds a nice incremental zero\nto their spend (and hits a milestone the hyperclouds all passed in 2016), but\nit still doesn\u2019t come close to what the hyperclouds are spending. If you add\nup Oracle\u2019s actual CAPEX spending and guidance for their fiscal years 2022\nthrough 2025, it doesn\u2019t match what Google and Microsoft spent in 2023.\n\nTo give a sense of how dramatically Oracle is being left behind, here is the\ncombined CAPEX spending of AWS, Google and Microsoft (corporate level spend\nfor Google and Microsoft, but ~80% of that is cloud infrastructure), minus\nOracle\u2019s spending (which is also corporate level). The gap has grown from $20\nbillion in 2015 to over $90 billion in 2023.\n\nFor completeness, to make Oracle\u2019s clown car status abundantly clear, and to\nmake my biennial favorite joke about Oracle being indistinguishable from the\nx-axis, here is annual and cumulative CAPEX for both the hyperclouds and\nOracle.\n\nThe Oracle plan to catch up to the hyperclouds remains unclear to me.\n\n## What Ever Happened to...\n\nWhile our once-promising cohort of new clowns disappointed in both their\nhyperbole and investment, they remain entertaining in other ways:\n\n  * Bank of America \u2013 still dominant as the worldwide leader in financial crime, but is also now insolvent in the wake of rising interest rates. And still have spent ZERO on CAPEX since 2011 (bank accounting FTW). Their alum and pal at IBM who was leading the charge for a compliance-oriented private cloud doohickey bailed, so expect B of A to eventually be the last bank to embrace the public cloud.\n  * GAIA-X \u2013 the EU\u2019s hand waving assertion of their strategic cloud autonomy \u201cbased on European values\u201d is, in the words of one booster, \u201ca paper monster that will exist but will not have any impact in the market\u201d. Others say it \u201cfailed to reach critical mass or really take off\u201d, \u201coperates too much at the meta level\u201d, is \u201cstill a long way from clear, tangible use cases\u201d and \u201cnever got out of this theoretical sinkhole\u201d. Even IBM spends more on CAPEX in a year than GAIA-X\u2019s multi-year budget.\n  * Trump Media & Technology Group \u2013 \u201cNet cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $2.2 thousand\u201d ($2,200.00). Emphatically serverless!\n\nWe now return to our regular programming.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * Tumblr\n  * Telegram\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Mastodon\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCapex, Ibm, Oracle\n\nPrevious: Platformonomics TGIF #46: April 5, 2024\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
