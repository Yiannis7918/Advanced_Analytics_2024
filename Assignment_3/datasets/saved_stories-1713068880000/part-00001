They\u2019ve cracked the\ncode on building a truly inclusive workforce, one where nearly 40 per cent of\nits workforce comprises women associates. This commitment to diversity isn\u2019t\njust about optics; it\u2019s a strategic imperative that fuels innovation and\ndrives growth.\n\nCarelon\u2019s secret weapon? A data-driven approach that ensures fairness and\nminimises bias throughout the talent pipeline. \u201cWe leverage data analytics and\nreporting to identify trends and tailor interventions accordingly,\u201d explains\nSubhashini Sriram, managing director, HR, Carelon Global Solutions. \u201cThis\nallows us to offer data-driven insights to leaders and ensure everyone has the\nresources they need to thrive.\u201d\n\nCarelon Global Solutions understands that continuous learning is paramount for\ncareer advancement, especially for women. While training programmes are open\nto all, the company actively encourages female participation through targeted\nnudges and interventions. They analyse data on training nominations,\npromotions, and pay increases to identify any discrepancies or participation\ngaps. This data-driven approach ensures equal access to opportunities and\nhelps address any underlying reasons for lower participation rates.\n\n> \u201cWe leverage data analytics and reporting to identify trends and tailor\n> interventions. This allows us to offer data-driven insights to leaders and\n> ensure everyone has the resources they need to thrive.\u201d\n>\n> Subhashini Sriram, managing director-HR, Carelon Global Solutions\n\nMentorship programmes are a cornerstone of Carelon\u2019s strategy. These\nprogrammes go beyond traditional structures, fostering personalised\nconnections that empower women to navigate both personal and professional\nchallenges. \u201cWe don\u2019t just track metrics,\u201d emphasises Sriram. \u201cWe prioritise\ncreating an environment where women can thrive and build meaningful\nconnections with mentors.\u201d\n\nCarelon Global Solutions recognises the importance of work-life balance,\nespecially for women. They offer flexible work arrangements, including remote\nwork options, and have robust childcare and eldercare support systems in\nplace. Additionally, location-wise chapters within the company\u2019s women\u2019s\nnetwork ensure accessibility for face-to-face support and mentorship\nopportunities.\n\nThe company actively fosters a culture of collaboration and networking. They\nhost events featuring external female leaders, facilitate connections with\nexternal networks, and organise STEM hackathons specifically tailored for\nwomen. These initiatives provide valuable exposure and mentorship\nopportunities, allowing women to connect with experts and build their\nprofessional networks.\n\nThe company\u2019s robust referral programme is a testament to the positive\nsentiment among employees. With a consistent 40 per cent gender-diversity\nratio, the programme highlights not only the company\u2019s commitment to diversity\nbut also the willingness of existing employees to actively endorse a culture\nof inclusion.\n\nTo ensure fairness throughout the hiring process, the company tracks referral\ndata and provides sensitivity training to interviewers. This ensures inclusive\nand respectful interactions with all candidates, regardless of background.\n\nCarelon Global Solutions empowers employees to take ownership of their careers\nthrough Individual Development Plans (IDPs). These plans provide tools and\nresources for self-evaluation and skill enhancement. Additionally, the company\nconducts specific sessions focused on women\u2019s talent succession planning,\nensuring equitable representation and advancement opportunities.\n\nCarelon Global Solutions leverages advanced AI technology to facilitate open\ncommunication and gather valuable feedback from employees. An AI bot engages\nwith associates in ongoing dialogues, providing insights into their career\ndevelopment needs and experiences. This feedback loop is instrumental in\nrefining company\u2019s support systems and ensuring they continue to meet the\nevolving needs of their diverse workforce.\n\nCarelon\u2019s journey towards diversity and inclusion is not a recent fad; it\u2019s\nbeen a core value since the company\u2019s inception. \u201cWe provide comprehensive\nsupport to our associates, addressing their needs at a grassroots level,\u201d\nconcludes Sriram. By prioritising data, fostering a supportive ecosystem, and\nempowering employee growth, Carelon has established itself as a model for\nbuilding a truly inclusive workplace.\n\n### Comment on the Article Cancel reply\n\nValue our content... contribute towards our growth.
