They repeated this sequence 172 times. (Courtesy: Jain, S,\nS\u00e4gesser, T, Hrmo, P et al., Penning micro-trap for quantum computing. Nature\n627, 510\u2013514 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07111-x)\n\nTrapping ions with static magnetic and electric fields instead of an\noscillating electromagnetic field could make it easier to use ions as building\nblocks for quantum computers. The new approach, which was developed by\nresearchers at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, allows better control of an ion\u2019s\nquantum state and position, and marks an important step towards scaling up\ntrapped ions as a platform for quantum computation.\n\nQuantum computers can outperform classical ones at certain problems. Realizing\ntheir full potential will, however, require machines that can manipulate\naround 1 million quantum bits (qubits). This is orders of magnitude more than\ntoday\u2019s largest quantum processors, and scaling up is challenging because\nqubits become more difficult to produce and control as their numbers increase.\n\nFor example, the ions used as qubits in trapped-ion quantum processors are\nusually kept in place by electromagnetic fields oscillating at radio\nfrequencies (RF), and their quantum states are controlled and read with pulses\nof laser light. This works well for up to 30 qubits, but scaling to higher\nnumbers is tricky. Combining RF fields in the small space of a single chip is\nchallenging, and the fields also heat the trap, disturbing the ions\u2019 quantum\nbehaviour. A further problem is that the structure of the RF fields restricts\ntrap locations to a linear grid.\n\n### Penning traps\n\nThe ETH team addressed these problems by switching to a type of trap that is\ntraditionally used to confine ions for applications such as precision\nspectroscopy and quantum simulations. These so-called Penning traps replace RF\nfields with strong static magnetic fields, which eliminates heating and\nremoves restrictions on trap configuration. However, strong magnetic fields\nbring their own challenges. Their presence increases the spacing between the\nions\u2019 energy states, making it harder to control these states with light from\nsimple, cheap diode lasers. The superconducting magnets that produce them are\nalso bulky, and laser light needs to be guided around them.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the ETH researchers constructed their Penning\ntrap by placing a microfabricated chip (produced by colleagues at Leibniz\nUniversity in Hannover, Germany) with several electrodes inside a 3 Tesla\nsuperconducting magnet. A system of mirrors guides phase-locked laser beams\nthrough the magnet to the ions, and the entire set-up is placed in a vacuum\nand cryogenically cooled.\n\n### It\u2019s a trap!\n\nThe new trap lived up to expectations, confining a single ion for several days\nand giving the ETH researchers full control over its movement and position\n(see image). To test the set-up\u2019s viability for quantum computing, the team\nmeasured the ion\u2019s coherence time \u2013 that is, the amount of time it remains in\na quantum state \u2013 and showed that this was longer than the time required to\nperform a quantum operation. They also showed that lasers could control the\nenergy states of the ion without disturbing its quantum superposition. This\ncapability makes it possible to create entangled states between different\nqubits and therefore perform quantum computations.\n\nRead more\n\n####\n\nNovel superconducting cavity qubit pushes the limits of quantum coherence\n\nPeter Zoller, a physicist at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, who was not\ninvolved in this project, describes the micro-Penning trap with easy ion\ntransport as a \u201crefreshing, innovative idea\u201d. He adds that it is great to see\ninnovations used for trapped arrays of neutral atoms being applied to trapped\nion architectures. However, he points out that the trap\u2019s capabilities have so\nfar only been shown for a single ion. It will be interesting, he says, to see\nhow it scales and performs (in the form of gate fidelities) with many ions,\nand how it compares with alternative approaches such as surface traps or\nquantum racetracks.\n\nJonathan Home, the leader of the ETH team, agrees that adding more ions is\nimportant. The next steps, he tells Physics World, will be to \u201ctry to load\nmultiple ions and perform multi-qubit gates between ions in separate trap\nsites\u201d.\n\nThe research is published in Nature.\n\nMartijn Boerkamp is a science writer based in the Netherlands\n\n### Quantum newsletter\n\nSign up today for our bimonthly newsletter\n\nRead previous\n\n  * Polymers\n  * Research update\n\n#### Sticky materials un-stick themselves in jumps\n\nRead next\n\n  * Diagnostic imaging\n  * Research update\n\n#### Functional ultrasound imaging provides real-time feedback during spinal\nsurgery\n\n## Discover more from Physics World\n\n    * Quantum computing\n    * Opinion and reviews\n\n### Why error correction is quantum computing\u2019s defining challenge\n\n    * Quantum\n    * News\n\n### MEPs call for \u2018urgent action\u2019 to implement post-quantum encryption\nstandards\n\n    * Quantum mechanics\n    * Research update\n\n### Giant quantum tornado behaves like a black hole in miniature\n\n## Related jobs\n\n  * United Kingdom | QinetiQ\n\n#### Senior Quantum Scientist\n\n  * Germany | Karlsruhe Institute of Technology\n\n#### University Professorship (W3) \"Quantum Materials\"\n\n  * Broomfield | Quantinuum US\n\n#### Principle Physicist\n\n## Related events\n\n  * Quantum | Conference IQT The Hague 22\u201424 April 2024 | The Hague, Netherlands\n  * Quantum | Conference Quantum.Tech USA 24\u201426 April 2024 | Washington DC, US\n  * Quantum | Conference IQT Vancouver-Pacific Rim 4\u20146 June 2024 | Vancouver, Canada\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by IOP Publishing Ltd and individual contributors\n\n#### Explore Physics World\n\n  * About us\n  * Our team\n  * Our portfolio\n  * Advertising\n  * Contact us\n  * Feedback\n  * Sign in\n  * Register\n\n#### MORE INFORMATION\n\n  * Institute of Physics\n  * Join the Institute\n  * Modern Slavery Act\n  * Privacy and Cookies\n  * IOP Publishing\n  * Copyright\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * Disclaimer\n\n#### OUR MISSION\n\nPhysics World represents a key part of IOP Publishing's mission to communicate\nworld-class research and innovation to the widest possible audience.
