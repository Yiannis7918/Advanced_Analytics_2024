This raises several challenges\nregarding power management or integration, but also raise new cybersecurity\nconcerns, where communication protocols are more and more complex, and\nhardware is shared among mixed-criticality software. With millions of lines of\ncode, new protocols, more and more applicative use-cases and complex software,\nhow could the cybersecurity teams keep up the pace? At Renault, we push\ntowards Rust as a way of simplifying the car architecture, reducing costs,\nimproving time to market, and satisfying developers (and cyber folks). We'll\nexplain the beginning of this journey, and what we expect from our company as\nwell as our partners (from SoC vendors to SW suppliers) and the ecosystem.\n\nShow less Show more\n\nTranscript\n\nFollow along using the transcript.\n\n### Rust Nation UK\n\n3.86K subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nOur Twitter\n\nOur LinkedIn\n\nOur Instagram\n\n## Comments 3\n\nTop comments\n\nNewest first\n\n## Transcript\n\nNaN / NaN\n\n# Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ameye - Renault want to sell cars with rust!\n\nRust Nation UK\n\nRust Nation UK\n\n3.86K subscribers\n\n<__slot-el>\n\n<__slot-el>\n\nDownload\n\n1.7K views 10 days ago\n\n1,710 views \u2022 Apr 3, 2024\n\nShow less\n\nCar manufacturers are transforming into software development companies, mainly\nwith the concept of 'Software-Defined Vehicle'.
