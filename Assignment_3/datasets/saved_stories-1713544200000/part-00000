They listened intently as Jokowi,\nas the outgoing president is popularly known, gestured at swaths of eucalyptus\ntrees and said, \u201cRemember, this is an industrial forest. It\u2019s chopped down\nevery six years. It is not a natural forest. Don\u2019t get it wrong.\u201d\n\nThe gathered influencers took note. On TikTok, Jerhemy Owen told his 3 million\nfollowers: \u201cNusantara will be the smartest and most eco-friendly city in the\nworld! It will be 65% forest and 25% urban area.\u201d\n\nAs Indonesia prepares to move its capital away from the overcrowded and\nrapidly sinking city of Jakarta, authorities are relying on influencers to\nsell Nusantara as a liveable and desirable city. Briefings have been held\nacross the country with influencers, who are regarded as \u201cstrategic partners.\u201d\nIn last September\u2019s tour of the future capital, dozens of influencers listened\nto the president lay out his vision for Nusantara. Jokowi even joked with them\nand posed for selfies.\n\n\u201cWe hope influencers can participate in disseminating information [to the\npublic] about Nusantara,\u201d Usman Kansong, director-general of communications at\nthe Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, said in a separate\nbriefing in the city of Bandung. \u201cThe goal is to increase the public\u2019s\nknowledge, as well as to create a positive attitude towards moving to the\ncapital city.\u201d\n\nBuilding a capital city from scratch is rare, but not unheard of. Brazil moved\nits capital from Rio de Janeiro to the newly built city of Bras\u00edlia in 1960.\nEgypt is building an administrative capital about 30 miles from Cairo, despite\nconcerns about the enormous expense as the country goes through an economic\ndownturn.\n\nTikTok influencer @jerhemynemoo shares his visit through Nusantara with his 3\nmillion followers.\n\nNusantara, too, is rife with controversy. Just over half of Indonesians\nsupport the new capital, according to the latest survey by research firm\nIndikator Politik Indonesia. But many are also fighting for the millions of\ndollars promised as compensation for the land they gave up. Private investment\nin the capital has been slow to come. Environmentalists and activists have\ncriticized the clearing of mangroves and forests, and the forced displacement\nof local residents and Indigenous communities.\n\n\u201cDeforestation is a real issue,\u201d Arga Pribadi Imawan, a professor in the\ndepartment of politics and government at Gadjah Mada University, told Rest of\nWorld. With thousands of acres of trees flattened to the ground, the city is\nat risk of frequent flooding and water contamination, he said. \u201cI\u2019m very\ndoubtful of the concept of a \u2018smart forest city.\u2019 Governments typically cut\ndown the forest, build the city, then rebuild the forest somewhere else. But\nresearch shows that rebuilding the forest can take over a century.\u201d\n\nThis is where the influencers come in. After their visit to Nusantara \u2014 an old\nJavanese word once used to describe the Indonesian archipelago \u2014 they posted\ngushing videos on their YouTube channels, Instagram reels, and TikTok.\n\nA nearly 16-minute video posted by actor and social media influencer Baim Wong\non his YouTube channel has more than 730,000 views. Many of his 21 million\nsubscribers praised Jokowi with comments such as: \u201cThe greatest president with\na proven track record!\u201d and \u201cAmazing work, President Jokowi, the government,\nand the influencers.\u201d\n\nBut while the posts by influencers have drawn praise for the president, and\nthe influencers themselves, not many commenters seem keen to move to the new\ncapital.\n\n\u201cFor Gen Z, there are fears that the city lacks entertainment options or\nplaces for \u2018healing\u2019 [Indonesian slang for taking a long break],\u201d Arga, who\nhas researched Nusantara, told Rest of World. \u201cSo it is good to use\ninfluencers, especially as the first stage will involve young civil servants.\nInfluencers can change their mindset so that young people from Java or Jakarta\nare willing to move to Nusantara.\u201d\n\nYouTuber Dian Rana shared a detailed vlog from his tour but was asked to take\ndown some subsequent videos showing the progress of construction in Nusantara.\n\nWith more than half of Indonesia\u2019s population of 270 million between the ages\nof 18 and 39 years, the country is among the biggest markets in the world for\nsocial media platforms including Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok. Influencers \u2014\nincluding virtual ones \u2014 have massive followings, and government officials\nhave increasingly been leaning on them to get their message out. \u201cBuzzers,\u201d or\nthose who accept payments for promotions, were a key feature of Indonesia\u2019s\npresidential election this year, boosting candidates and spreading\nmisinformation about their rivals.\n\nBut there is a risk that it might not work in the case of Nusantara, because\nyoung social media users may not be convinced if they think the influencers\nare not sincere. Arga said their posts on Nusantara \u201cdon\u2019t feel like an\nimpression that emerges out of pure admiration towards the new capital. It\nfeels scripted.\u201d\n\nThe influencers posting on Nusantara say they were not paid by the government.\nBut some Indonesians have called them out for not questioning the official\nline. After Aur\u00e9lie Moeremans, a singer and environmentalist with nearly 3\nmillion followers on Instagram, shared her video of meeting Jokowi in\nNusantara, there were several comments on the damage to the environment, and\nthe high cost of the project.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the brand ambassador of WWF-Indonesia. How come you support\nNusantara?\u201d said one user. \u201cIt\u2019s great and all, but how are we going to pay\nthe debt? Who is responsible?\u201d commented another.\n\nMeanwhile, in East Kalimantan, local influencers are facing difficulty\naccessing the site. Dian Rana in Sepaku, the district where Nusantara is\nlocated, has a following of about 250,000 on YouTube, and was among those\ninvited to meet Jokowi last September. While the government says the new\ncapital will host Indonesia\u2019s Independence Day celebration in August, Dian\nsaid it just doesn\u2019t look ready. He said it has become increasingly hard to\nget permission to shoot videos to show the progress of construction in\nNusantara, and that he has been asked to take down several videos.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t someone\u2019s private residence. It\u2019s a capital city,\u201d said Dian. \u201cIt\nshould be public knowledge.\u201d\n\nMichelle Anindya is a freelance journalist based in Bali, Indonesia.
