The network is in the midst of\nan identity crisis as it is outflanked by Fox News on the right, and MSNBC on\nthe left, which regularly beat it in the ratings.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, Thompson likened the shift to\ndigital platforms such as YouTube as an \u201cexistential question\u201d in the next\ndecade.\n\n\u201cDo we want to get more competitive in cable TV and by strengthening our\nschedules? Yes, we do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the rate at which people have been and\nprobably will continue to cut the cord and not look at cable TV at all is a\nfar, far greater strategic threat than the finer points of competition between\nindividual cable channels,\u201d said the former head of the BBC and The New York\nTimes.\n\n\u201cThe idea that there might be digital subscription is a serious possibility,\u201d\nadded Thompson, including streaming digital content. No decisions had been\nmade, but \u201cI think it\u2019s quite likely that we\u2019ll end up there\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need an entirely new digital strategy. I don\u2019t think any broadcaster has\ncracked the code on how to be yourself in terms of digital products. We\u2019ve\ntended all to go for executions in digital which are rather newspaper-like,\u201d\nhe added. \u201cConsumption of television is very strongly video-led and on\nplatforms like YouTube and TikTok.\u201d\n\nThompson has kicked off a reorganisation of CNN\u2019s newsroom \u00a9 Miguel\nMartinez/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP\n\nThompson managed a similar turnaround at his previous job at The New York\nTimes, where he helped transform a legacy newspaper into a digital-first media\ngroup.\n\nHowever, analysts said his task would be harder at CNN. The group had bigger\negos to handle among its news anchors, and higher pay cheques to justify even\nas ratings have dropped.\n\nAt The New York Times, Thompson was given the freedom to use free cash flow to\nreinvest in its digital transformation, and he hopes again to \u201cachieve what we\nneed to achieve substantially by bootstrapping with the money that we\u2019re\ngenerating\u201d, alongside cost-cutting efforts.\n\n\u201cWe remain a very cash-generative business,\u201d said Thompson, who was hired by\nWarner Bros Discovery chief executive David Zaslav. CNN\u2019s parent company is\nitself under pressure to cut costs, however, and analysts have flagged the\nnews channel as among assets that could be sold to help reduce WBD\u2019s $44bn\ndebt burden.\n\nThompson has kicked off a reorganisation of CNN\u2019s newsroom, bringing together\nseparate domestic and international operations across TV and digital \u201cto\ncreate a multi-platform, multimedia news organisation\u201d. He has brought back\nAlex MacCallum, his former New York Times lieutenant who had previously led\nCNN\u2019s push into streaming, to lead the transition to digital.\n\nAlex MacCallum will lead the transition to digital \u00a9 Jeremy Freeman/CNN/Warner\nMedia\n\nIn the shift to a multi-platform news organisation, he said when asked about\ncost-cutting, there are \u201clikely to be significant opportunities for de-\nduplication of parallel organisations and structures and activities. I think\nwe can and should be looking for ways of doing what we do both better, but\nalso doing it less expensively.\u201d\n\nThompson said CNN was exploring various options for driving digital revenues,\nincluding registration to gain greater information on its audience that can be\nsold to advertisers, and direct-to-consumer subscriptions.\n\n\u201cWe have 160mn people coming to us every month on CNN.com. And some tens of\nmillions more off-platform. So it\u2019s a very substantial group of people.\nThere\u2019s a large number of things we could do,\u201d he said, pointing to different\nmeans of distribution through smartphones and other devices as well as\n\u201copportunities from generative AI\u201d.\n\nHe forecast that viewers would want a continuous, TV-like experience playing\non devices across different digital platforms. CNN broadcasts three TV\nchannels \u2014 US cable, international and Max, the streaming service operated by\nits parent company \u2014 which often carry the same content but can also run\ndifferent shows.\n\nCNN has already tried a digital subscription service called CNN+, which was\nclosed just a month after its launch in April 2022. The service was axed after\nWarnerMedia merged with Discovery, bringing its brands under the Max streaming\nservice, with management believing it was too expansive.\n\nThompson said he would not seek simply to launch a similar service, which he\ndescribed as \u201ca big bold experiment, which was abandoned rather briskly\u201d, and\ncalled for patience, including from his own staff.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know in a few years time if we\u2019re beginning to make progress, even if\nthat still doesn\u2019t look like it because of the aggregation of declining\nplatforms and growing ones. But there\u2019s a world of difference between having a\npathway to the future and not.\u201d\n\nSuccess \u201cwon\u2019t happen overnight\u201d, he said.\n\nHe pushed back on critics, both internally and externally, who claim that he\n\u201cdoesn\u2019t care about TV\u201d.\n\nCNN has said it will monitor the accuracy of comments made by Donald Trump\nmore closely than in previous elections \u00a9 Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m a TV guy, I love it,\u201d he said, pointing to areas he\nwanted to strengthen such as financial news, and coverage in areas such as\nhealthcare, climate and sports and entertainment.\n\nCNN would not abandon its traditional base in cable TV, said Thompson,\ninsisting that he retained \u201cmuscle memory\u201d of wanting to win audiences from\nhis time as head of the BBC and Channel 4.\n\n\u201cI love going to the control room and watching shows, going out and arguing\nabout what to do. But we have to lean on these other things if we want to have\na healthy CNN, five or 10 years from now.\u201d\n\nThompson replaced Chris Licht, whose short tenure was dogged by some of the\nworst ratings in years. But Licht was also criticised for tinkering with shows\nand his roster of big-name anchors rather than making bold decisions about the\nfuture of the network.\n\nA year after Licht\u2019s exit, CNN has continued to trail well behind MSNBC and\nFox News for viewers. CNN averaged just 467,000 viewers a day in the first\nquarter, compared with 1.3mn for Fox News and 814,000 for MSNBC, according to\nNielsen.\n\nRecommended\n\nThe Trump machine\n\nThe uneasy truce between Donald Trump and Fox News\n\nCNN\u2019s ratings malaise is particularly troubling because it is an election year\nin the US, typically a boom time for cable news channels.\n\nRegarding the presidential race, Thompson promised that CNN would monitor the\naccuracy of comments made by Donald Trump more closely than in previous\nelections.\n\n\u201cWe recognise that in 2016, it was probably too much unfiltered, undiscussed,\nun-fact-checked Donald Trump on the air everywhere, but including on CNN,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nAnother of Thompson\u2019s predecessors, Jeff Zucker, drove a more opinion-heavy\nCNN through the Trump news boom, making for spectacular ratings and profits\nfor the broadcaster.\n\nThompson sees CNN as a neutral, trusted source, with a balance of right- and\nleft-leaning viewers \u201cthat\u2019s quite unusual in modern American media\u201d.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.
