A cross-functional team must\nassemble fast and pursue an organized response. It feels like fighting a fire.\nSo it\u2019s not surprising that formal IT incident management tends to borrow\nheavily from the discipline of firefighting.\n\nHowever, in software incident response, we have a crucial constraint that you\nwon\u2019t find in firefighting. Namely, in order to fix a software product, we\nfirst have to understand why it\u2019s broken.\n\nWhen the firefighters arrive at the blazing building, they don\u2019t need to\nexplain the fire. They need to put it out. It doesn\u2019t matter whether a toaster\nmalfunctioned, or a cat knocked over a candle, or a smoker fell asleep\nwatching The Voice. The immediate job is the same: get people to safety and\nput out the fire.\n\nBut when PagerDuty blows up and we all stumble into the incident call, we need\nat least a vague hypothesis. Without one, we can\u2019t even start fixing the\nproblem. What should we do? Reboot one of the web servers? Which one? Should\nwe revert the last deploy? Should we scale up the database? Flush the CDN?\nOpen a support ticket with Azure? Just wait?\n\nWe can\u2019t act until we have at least some explanation for how the outage came\nabout.\n\nOften, the process of diagnosis \u2013 of explaining the failure \u2013 takes up the\nmajority of the incident. Diagnosis isn\u2019t easy, especially in a group and\nunder pressure. Important facts go ignored. Hypotheses get forgotten, or\nremain unchallenged in the face of new information. Action items fall through\nthe cracks. Diagnostic disconnects like these add up to longer outages,\nnoisier public-facing comms, and repeat failures.\n\nAnd yet, when we look to improve IT incident response, what do we usually\nfocus on? On-call rotations, status page updates, command-and-control\nstructure. Sliding-down-the-firepole, radioing-with-dispatch type stuff.\n\nIn software incident response, we need to maintain a coherent diagnostic\nstrategy in the face of scarce information and severe time pressure. This\nmakes us, on one dimension at least, more like doctors than firefighters. This\nis one of the reasons that engineering teams find immense value in clinical\ntroubleshooting. It brings rigor and transparency to the joint diagnostic\neffort.\n\nI teach clinical troubleshooting as part of Scientific Incident Response in 4\nDays.
