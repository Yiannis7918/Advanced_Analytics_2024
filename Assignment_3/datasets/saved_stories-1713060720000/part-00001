By Shutterstock\n\n### Trends shaping the European vehicle industry in 2024: What cars are most\ndemanded in Europe?\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nThe 1990s and early 2000s sci-fi movies pictured the cities of the future with\nself-driving flying cars. Not sure about flying ones, but we already have\ndriverless cars, and most of us are not afraid of them. Of course, the future\nin the movies looks more digital and apocalyptic, but everything is possible\nwith such a rapid evolution of AI.\n\nCar wheels. Image generated by AI.\n\nFrom the expensive, not-so-practical cars of the 1900s to the electric cars of\n2024, the evolution of vehicles is really impressive. But today we will talk\nabout the present and the future of cars rather than their past. Let\u2019s narrow\nour research and stick to vehicle trends in Europe: what people drive, what\npeople will drive, and where the industry is going.\n\n## European Automotive Industry in 2024\n\nThe European automotive industry remains a significant economic powerhouse,\ndespite all the challenges and radical changes in recent years. It\u2019s hard to\nmake long-term perspectives, so let\u2019s have a look at insights and trends\nshaping the sector in 2024.\n\n  * The slowdown the industry experienced in 2023 was replaced by skyrocketing numbers, including a 12.1% increase in car registration. At the same time, by 2035, the demand is predicted to slow down due to Europe\u2019s aging population.\n  * In 2024, battery electric vehicle sales (BEVs) increased by 28.9%. The four largest markets are Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and Germany.\n  * Many European countries have implemented government incentives like tax breaks and subsidies to encourage electric vehicle adoption.\n  * The diesel car market faced a 4.9% decline in the EU, particularly in France, Spain, and Italy. On the other hand, diesel car sales surged by 4.9% in Germany.\n  * The transition to electric vehicles will require significant investments in infrastructure and charging networks.\n  * There\u2019s a growing focus on sustainability within the industry. It means manufacturers are now more focused on developing more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles.\n\n# Vehicle trends 2024 per country\n\nWe\u2019ve had some general talks about trends; now let\u2019s walk the streets of some\nEuropean countries and see what cars are trending. See what cars are in most\ndemand in Europe.\n\nP.S. You may not find luxury cars on this list because they are always there.\nInstead, we will focus on practicality, comfort, and budget options.\n\n## Vehicle trends in the United Kingdom\n\nThe challenging year 2023, which brought a shortage of vehicles and production\nissues, is over, and 2024 will bring new vehicles. However, demand will\ncontinue to lag behind production volumes. The used car market is expected to\ngrow compared to the new vehicle market.\n\nSumming up, let\u2019s see what cars create traffic in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Kia Sportage\n\nKia Sportage Crossover\u2019s hybrid version. Source: kia.com\n\nThe 2022 hybrid family crossover, with a 1,6 petrol engine, electric motor,\nand battery capacity of 13.8 kWh, is so far the most frequently seen vehicle,\nand there are many reasons why. It is practical, spacious, economical, and\nstylish. Okay, I\u2019m buying it!\n\n### Ford Puma\n\nFollowing the popular Focus and Fiesta, the Ford Puma is the second most\nfrequently seen vehicle for being one of the most practical SUVs in its class.\nUnder the hood, it offers a choice of fuel-efficient 1.0-liter EcoBoost\nengines with up to 155 horsepower, ideal for city driving and highway\ncruising.\n\n### Nissan Qashqai\n\nA perfect combination of comfort and capacity, plus it is a crossover for any\nroad. The smooth ride is powered by a fuel-efficient 1.3-liter turbocharged\npetrol engine, offering super economy. 2021 models also offer a hybrid e-Power\nengine for the super economy.\n\n## Vehicle trends Germany\n\nWhile we continue to praise German car manufacturing as the best, the industry\ncontinues to lose its competitors in e-mobility. And because most brands are\nstill petrol-fueled (and we love the \u201creal\u201d cars), Germany has the least\nnumber of electric cars. Manufacturers have already started adapting to the\nnew reality by offering hybrids and electric versions of oh-so-loved models.\n\nGerman cars race the roads of the world, and which cars are racing the roads\nof Germany?\n\n### Volkswagen Golf\n\nVW Golf GTI 2024. Source: vw.com\n\nThis year, a top favorite in Germany is the VW Golf, known for its\npracticality and reliability. With a recent model update in 2024, it will\nremain the best choice. It offers a variety of engine options, including\nefficient gasoline and plug-in hybrid version that ideally meets the growing\ndemand for electric vehicles.\n\n### Skoda Octavia\n\nThe Skoda Octavia may not be a frequent guest in your country, but in Germany,\nit is a strong contender, offering excellent value. It\u2019s expected to remain\npopular with families and those seeking a practical and comfortable car.\n\n### BMW 3 Series\n\nWho said we\u2019ve forgotten about our all-time favorite BMW? This year, it\u2019s\ngoing to be the 3 Series for a dynamic driving experience and a luxurious\ninterior. With the recent focus on electric vehicles, a plug-in hybrid version\nof the 3 Series will also contribute to its popularity in 2024.\n\n## Vehicle trends in France\n\nUnlike other European markets that have seen a decline, France had a strong\nstart in 2024, with growing numbers secured for the rest of the year. By the\nway, the market\u2019s largest share is SUVs, with a market value of \u20ac17.7bn.\n\n### The Renault Scenic E-Tech and Renault Clio\n\nRenault Scenic E-Tech. Source: renault.co.uk\n\nRenault Clio, the favorite of the French market, is sharing its fame with\nanother model, the Renault Scenic E-Tech plug-in hybrid electric vehicle,\ndesigned for families and those seeking a comfortable ride. Renault Clio will\nkeep its popularity due to its compact size and fuel efficiency.\n\n### Peugeot 208 and e-208\n\nPeugeot entered 2024 with a practical and stylish hatchback. It is the fully\nelectrical version of the already popular Peugeot 208 (by the way, the classy\n208 is also a top choice). Both versions are super savvy and comfortable,\nideal for eco-conscious drivers.\n\n### Citroen C3\n\nA strong competitor of Renault and Peugeot (funny to hear you reading names\nlike they are written) is another hatchback with a focus on comfort and\ncompetitive pricing. 1.2-liter PureTech petrol engines will not give you the\ndesired speed but will provide a good balance of performance and fuel\nefficiency.\n\n## Vehicle trends in Spain\n\n2024 started positively for the Spanish automotive market. The sales\nregistered a 9.9% increase in both the new and used car markets.\n\n### Seat Ibiza\n\nSeat Ibiza. Source: seat.com\n\nThis subcompact hatchback, known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and\nsporty handling, is ideal for Spanish roads. Most popular among the younger\ngeneration, it gives a fun driving experience with sports vibes.\n\n### Dacia Sandero\n\nAnother budget-friendly option amid petrol price in Sandero at an incredible\nvalue. It turns out that Sandero is quite popular in European countries. It\nhas surprisingly good interior space and fuel efficiency. Still, it lacks\nmodern technologies (well, the price speaks for itself).\n\n### Peugeot 208\n\nFrom France to Spain, Peugeot continues to be the top choice in its segment\nwith modern design, comfort, practicality, and economy.\n\n## Vehicle trends in Italy\n\nAlfa Romeo Tonale, Maserati Grecale, Ferrari Roma, Lamborghini Urus\u2014those\nnames sound like a melody, but let\u2019s get back to reality and the cars we, most\nprobably, can drive.\n\nThe Italian market has seen a major increase in electric cars in a year, but\nthe significant growth of the automotive market is still on behalf of\ngasoline-engine cars.\n\n### Fiat Panda\n\nFiat Panda. Source: fiat.co.uk\n\nFiat is leading the Italian market for being affordable and extremely\nmaneuverable (which is critical for narrow roads). For its size, it is a top\nchoice for big cities, while fuel efficiency makes it a great companion for\nlong drives to Positano.\n\n### Dacia Sandero\n\nThe Dacia Sandero is the champion of affordability, offering incredible value\nfor money and surprising space in a hatchback package.\n\n### Citroen C3\n\nCitroen won its place for being stylish and affordable, leaving in the dust\nFord and Audia of the same segment.\n\n## Vehicle Trends in the Netherlands\n\nFinally, in the Netherlands, we will see electric cars dominating. In January\n2024, EV sales outpaced traditional petrol and diesel cars, registering a 64%\nincrease in battery-only and a 21% increase in hybrid vehicle registration.\n\n### Volvo XC40 and XC40 Recharge\n\nVolvo CX 40. Source: volvo.com\n\nThe Volvo XC40 and XC40 Recharge are subcompact luxury SUVs that stand out for\ntheir blend of safety, comfort, and technology. The models are packed with\nadvanced technologies and have premium designs, available in fuel-efficient\ngasoline engines and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) powertrain options.\n\n### Kia Picanto\n\nThough electric cars are trending, the Kia Picanto is still one of the leading\nmodels in its segment for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and compact\nsize.\n\n### Hyundai i10\n\nThe Hyundai i10 is the competitor of the Kia Picanto, sharing the same\nfeatures, plus it comes in a very stylish and modern design.\n\n## Vehicle trends in Poland\n\nToyota Corolla. source: toyota.com\n\nThe Polish automotive market had a promising start, with a 22.1% increase in\nsales. The market is still shared between European and Asian brands, both in\nbudget and premium segments.\n\n### Toyota Corolla\n\nA well-established model is, so far, the leader in the Polish market and on\nroads that provide a reliable driving experience with gasoline and hybrid\npowertrain options.\n\n### Toyota Yaris Cross\n\nIf the sedan is not your type but you still want Toyota, the Polish market\noffers another popular option, the Yaris Cross compact SUV with a higher ride\nheight, more space, and more comfort. At the same time, it provides good fuel\neconomy and extra safety.\n\n### Skoda Octavia\n\nThese cars in the C-segment are a blend of European design with a focus on\ncomfort and practicality, offered at a competitive price.\n\n## Vehicle trends in Switzerland\n\nOne last automotive market to explore is Switzerland, and as expected, we have\na parade of premium-class cars competing for first place. The market, like\neverything in Switzerland, I guess, is stable.\n\n### BMW X3 and Series 3\n\nBMW X3 on the road. Source: bmwusa.com\n\nPowerful engine and, at the same time, fuel economy, all-wheel drive for off-\nroad conditions, comfortable seating, and various driver-assistance systems. I\nmean, this is BMW; I could say nothing at all.\n\n### \u0160koda Enyaq\n\nOf course, the Swiss love electric cars, and in this niche, \u0160koda Enyaq is the\nleader for its German quality, stylish sporty design, long drive range, and\nmodern technology.\n\n### Audi Q4\n\nSwiss roads love luxury, and no wonder the Audi A4 luxury sedan is on our\nlist. It offers fantastic driving dynamics with a touch of sportiness and\ntechnology for sharp handling and a responsive experience.\n\n## Conclusion: A note from the author\n\nVehicle trends in Europe\n\nI was writing this article and thinking about my Honda, which has loyally\nserved me for 7 years (and still does). Of course, it is not a luxury car, but\nit has saved me a million times, and I\u2019m grateful to have this baby. One day,\nI will kiss goodbye to my car, and my choice will definitely be based on three\nrules; comfort, economy, and color (I mean, seriously, guys, a black car is\nhell unless you are ready to wash it every other day).\n\nShare on FacebookShare on Twitter\n\nprevious article\n\n### Rome-Budapest flights scanner\n\nthe authorAnush Bichakhchyan\n\nContent writer\n\nAnush is a freelance content writer and columnist.
