We are actually\ndetecting odor molecules that enter our nose and interact with cells that send\nsignals to be processed by our brain. While certain smells feel like they\u2019re\nunchanging, the complexity of this system means that large odorant molecules\nare perceived as the sum of their parts\u2014and we are capable of perceiving the\nexact same molecule as a different smell.\n\nSmell is more complex than we might think. It doesn\u2019t consist of simply\ndetecting specific molecules. Researcher Wen Zhou and his team from the\nInstitute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have now found that\nparts of our brains analyze smaller parts of the odor molecules that make\nthings smell.\n\n## Smells like...\n\nSo how do we smell? Odor molecules that enter our noses stimulate olfactory\nsensory neurons. They do this by binding to odorant receptors on these neurons\n(each of which makes only one of approximately 500 different odor receptors).\nSmelling something activates different neurons depending on what the molecules\nin that smell are and which receptors they interact with. The sensory neurons\nin the piriform cortex of the brain then use the information from the sensory\nneurons and interpret it as a message that makes us smell vanilla. Or a\nbouquet of flowers. Or whatever else.\n\nOdor molecules were previously thought to be coded only as whole molecules,\nbut Zhou and his colleagues wanted to see whether the brain\u2019s analysis of odor\nmolecules could perceive something less than a complete molecule. They\nreasoned that, if only whole molecules work, then after being exposed to a\npart of an odorant molecule, the test subjects would smell the original\nmolecule exactly the same way. If, by contrast, the brain was able to pick up\non the smell of a molecule\u2019s substructures, neurons would adapt to the\nsubstructure. When re-exposed to the original molecule, subjects would not\nsense it nearly as strongly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf [sub-molecular factors are part of our perception of an odor]\u2014the\npercept[ion] and its neural representation would be shifted towards those of\nthe unadapted part of that compound,\u201d the researchers said in a study recently\npublished in Nature Human Behavior.\n\n## Doesn\u2019t smell like...\n\nTo see whether their hypothesis held up, Zhou\u2019s team presented test subjects\nwith a compound abbreviated CP, its separate components C and P, and an\nunrelated component, U. P and U were supposed to have equal aromatic intensity\ndespite being different scents.\n\nIn one session, subjects smelled CP and then sniffed P until they had adapted\nto it. When they smelled CP again, they reported it smelling more like C than\nP. Despite being exposed to the entire molecule, they were mostly smelling C,\nwhich was unadapted. In another session, subjects adapted to U, after which\nthere was no change in how they perceived CP. So, the effect is specific to\nsmelling a portion of the odorant molecule.\n\nIn yet another experiment, subjects were told to first smell CP and then adapt\nto the smell of P with just one nostril while they kept the other nostril\nclosed. Once adapted, CP and C smelled similar, but only when snorted through\nthe nostril that had been open. The two smelled much more different through\nthe nostril that had been closed.\n\nPrevious research has shown that adaptation to odors takes place in the\npiriform cortex. Substructure adaptation causes this part of the brain to\nrespond differently to the portions of a chemical that the nose has recently\nbeen exposed to.\n\nThis olfactory experiment showed that our brains perceive smells by doing more\nthan just recognizing the presence of a whole odor molecule. Some molecules\ncan be perceived as a collection of submolecular units that are perceived\nseparately.\n\n\u201cThe smells we perceived are the products of continuous analysis and synthesis\nin the olfactory system,\u201d the team said in the same study, \u201cbreath by breath,\nof the structural features and relationships of volatile compounds in our\never-changing chemical environment.\u201d\n\nNature Human Behaviour, 2024.
