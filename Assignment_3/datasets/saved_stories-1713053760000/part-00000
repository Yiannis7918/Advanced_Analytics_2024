Simple.\n\nIf you have a perfect strategy but poor execution, you don\u2019t win. And worse,\nyou don\u2019t know why you didn\u2019t win \u2014 is it because your strategy was wrong, or\nbecause your execution was wrong? You\u2019ve wasted time, and worse, you\u2019ve\nlearned nothing.\n\nIf you have a mediocre strategy but great execution, you still don\u2019t win. But\nat least you know why you didn\u2019t win \u2014 you know your execution was great, so\nyou must have lost because your strategy wasn\u2019t exactly right. Now you can\nupdate your strategy, and you have your execution machine ready to go to pick\nup the changes and ship them out. You keep doing that enough, and then you\nwin.\n\nOne example of this at Meta was how often we worked on tackling a problem \u2014\nwith a slightly updated solution \u2014 repeatedly until we got it right. For\ninstance, it took us multiple tries over several years to build a successful\nad network. (I worked on our first version \u2014 now ~15 years ago!) With each\ntry, we refined our target audience, the formats we provided, and the way we\ncreated value, until we got the right match for what our customers needed.\n\nOf course, a good strategy is important. There\u2019s no point in executing on a\nbad strategy. But by focusing on execution, we can iterate toward the strategy\nthat wins for our customers today, even as the world changes.\n\nWhat does it take to focus on execution? The same tools that work for setting\nany cultural focus:\n\n  1. Allocating time. How much time should any given team be spending on strategy versus execution? 20/80 might be a good start for most teams. It\u2019s useful to set this expectation up front, so people know what to expect in the rhythm of building and where they should spend their time personally.\n\n  2. Creating a strong customer feedback loop. After you execute fast and ship a product, how do you know if you\u2019re on the right path? We need a clear way to constantly understand how customers are reacting to this version, whether it\u2019s through dashboards or qualitative feedback, and feed that back into our system so we can update our strategy and ship the next version.\n\n  3. Creating clear incentives. Leaders can model a focus on execution by highlighting improvements, recognizing the teams building them, and showcasing how these compounding changes help our customers. Over time, career ladders and performance reviews should match those expectations around where it\u2019s most valuable for people to spend their time.\n\nWhat I like most about focusing on execution is that it gives you so many more\ntries. I don\u2019t just have one shot to create a perfect strategy \u2014 I have a shot\nevery day to ship something, learn what works, and then update my principles\nto ship an even better product tomorrow.\n\nThanks for reading The Hard Parts of Growth!

More power to iterative strategizing while\nperfecting execution. I wonder if the 20/80 split is actually a flexible\ntarget and varies according to the problem at hand. Are there situations\nwherein you have had to overhaul the whole effort because of the wrong\nstrategy.Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nAbhishek UpadhyayApr 10\u00b7edited Apr 12Hey Ami, great post and thanks for your\ninsights.

Betting on the wrong horse can be fatal\neven if you run the race well. So some up-front strategic rigor is vital,\nisn't it?Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 more comment...\n\nMy manager owns context, I own the recommendation\n\nWhen I walked into one of my first leadership reviews, I felt ready.
