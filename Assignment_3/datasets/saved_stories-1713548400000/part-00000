Many modern inventions and occupations rely on\ndata. Artificial intelligence feasts on it. Machine learning identifies\npatterns within it. Internet of Things devices generate and transmit it.\nGenomics, bioinformatics, climate science, telecommunications, finance, health\ncare and so many more fields depend on it.\n\nFor massive datasets to be of use, they must be stored somehow. More than 70\npercent of the world\u2019s data is kept in arrays of magnetic disk drives\u2014all of\nwhich use so-called spintronic technologies developed by Stuart Parkin.\n\n### Stuart Parkin\n\nEmployer Max Planck Institute for Microstructure Physics in Halle, Germany\n\nTitle Director\n\nMember Grade Fellow\n\nAlma Mater Trinity College Cambridge, in England\n\nThe director of the Max Planck Institute for Microstructure Physics, in Halle,\nGermany, Parkin is the most recent recipient of the Draper Prize for\nEngineering, which is considered to be the highest U.S. award for the\ndiscipline.\n\nShort for spin transport electronics, spintronics harnesses both the\nelectron\u2019s intrinsic magnetic property\u2014its spin\u2014and its electric charge to\nimprove electronic devices. Spintronics can make them more energy-efficient,\nfaster to access data, or capable of storing huge amounts of information.\n\nTraditionally, the field of electronics has relied merely on manipulating the\nelectron\u2019s charge. Spintronics, however, also leverages electrons\u2019 \u201cnatural\u201d\nmagnetic moment.\n\nThrough the Draper Prize, the U.S. National Academy of Engineering honors an\nengineer whose accomplishment has \u201csignificantly impacted society by improving\nthe quality of life, providing the ability to live freely and comfortably,\nand/or permitting access to information.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a great honor and surprise to receive an award, as there are many\nfantastic scientists who could have been given the prize,\u201d says Parkin, an\nIEEE Fellow and NAE member. \u201cThis one is particularly special, as there\u2019s an\nincredible series of past winners whose major contributions to technologies\nhave made the world a better place. To be included with those wonderful\nscientists is amazing.\u201d\n\n## Superconductors and magnetic disk drives\n\nParkin holds a Humboldt professorship at Martin Luther University, also in\nHalle.\n\nHe invented spintronic technologies at IBM, where he worked for 32 years. Most\nof that time was spent at the company\u2019s famed Almaden research laboratory, in\nSan Jose, Calif. IBM built the lab three years after hiring Parkin.\n\nWhen he began in 1982, he says, IBM employed about 10,000 people who worked on\nmagnetic disk drives for storage. His assignment was a dream job, he says:\nConduct exploratory research that could help make the company\u2019s storage\ntechnology better.\n\nHe was at the right place at the right time, he says: \u201cJust the year before\nsome new organic metals had been discovered that, under pressure, became\nsuperconducting at relatively low temperatures.\n\n\u201cIt was great fun and the beginning of something quite new.\u201d\n\nHe collaborated with physicists and chemists at IBM who ultimately discovered\na family of organic superconductors in 1983. The work progressed for the next\nfew years, but after that, Parkin says, IBM decided it no longer needed to\nkeep a few dozen people working on just organic metals.\n\nHis supervisors assigned him to lead a group researching magnetism for more\nefficient data storage. He was already familiar with magnetism, the focus of\nhis physics Ph.D. thesis.\n\nParkin immersed himself in all things magnetoelectronics, consulting with\nexperts from around the world and attending conferences. He was fascinated by\nwork in magnetic multilayers, which are materials made of thin films with\nalternating magnetic and nonmagnetic layers.\n\nResearch at the time showed the materials had \u201cinteresting properties that\ncould make it possible to store far more data, far more efficiently,\u201d Parkin\nsays.\n\n## A two-year wait for a molecular beam epitaxy machine\n\nParkin decided the IBM team needed more advanced film deposition techniques to\nbuild magnetic multilayer structures. He asked management to purchase a US\n$1.25 million molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) machine, which could make precision\nfabrication of thin films.\n\nThe managers approved his request, but it took two years for the machine to be\ndelivered. It was scheduled to be housed in a dream lab Parkin had designed\nwithin a new research center that sat atop a hill a few kilometers from the\nAlmaden location.\n\n\u201cThe machine was all set up, and the lab was about to open, when suddenly a\nmanager turned to me and said, \u2018Oh, no, you don\u2019t know anything about thin\nfilms. We\u2019re going to hire an expert.\u2019 Someone from Westinghouse came in, and\nsuddenly it was his lab; not mine,\u201d Parkin recalls.\n\nParkin says he was undeterred, but he was also without the pricey MBE machine.\nSo he raided an equipment storage room filled with machinery IBM no longer\nused. Using an ultrahigh vacuum chamber, an ion pump, and a special\nflange\u2014along with magnetron sputtering, an antiquated vacuum deposition\nmethod\u2014he managed to build his own film deposition system. He could pump out\n20 different multilayered structures daily to run experiments on thin films\nand materials.\n\n\u201cI could make a lot of different films by myself, immediately test hypotheses,\nand make lots of discoveries,\u201d he says. \u201cIn retrospect, losing the lab was a\ngood thing. The MBE system was extremely time-consuming to use, and my\noutmoded sputtering system was faster and more effective.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he developed three distinct spintronic technologies. One of them\u2014a\nmethod to achieve very high levels of the tunneling magnetoresistance\nphenomenon in materials at room temperature\u2014unlocked a massive increase in\ndigital data storage capabilities.\n\n\u201cWhen you discover something new, you have novel insights into how the world\nworks.\u201d\n\nWhen IBM shifted from hardware to software, Parkin became a consulting\nprofessor at Stanford, where he met his wife, Claudia Felser, a German chemist\nand materials engineer. Felser soon joined Planck as a scientist in residence,\nand not long after, Parkin learned that the Max Planck Institute was looking\nfor a director to reorganize and revitalize its 30-year-old microstructure\nphysics group.\n\nThe institute, which is funded by federal and state governments, is dedicated\nto furthering research in the natural sciences, life sciences, and humanities.\nIt maintains 84 individual institutes and other facilities worldwide.\n\nParkin accepted the position and moved to Halle.\n\nThe institute \u201cis like IBM was in the old days, in that the philosophy is to\ngive researchers sufficient funding so they can focus on moving science\nforward,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to do fundamental science, with a view to\nimpacting the world, technologically in the next 5, 10, and 20 years.\u201d\n\nParkin says he applies the same philosophy when advising Ph.D. students at\nMartin Luther University.\n\n\u201cThe job is to encourage them to do the impossible. What a beautiful thing,\u201d\nhe says. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see so many of them be creative and go beyond what\nthey believed was possible.\n\n\u201cWhen you discover something new, you have novel insights into how the world\nworks. That\u2019s what I hope the students come to appreciate.\u201d\n\n## Spintronics increases access to knowledge\n\nGrowing up in Manchester, England, and then Edinburgh, Parkin was shy, he\nsays, spending much of his time reading.\n\n\u201cI like to think nowadays paper books aren\u2019t needed as much because everything\nis digital,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder to think I played some role in enabling\nthat, because it makes all this knowledge more accessible to all of us. I find\nthat amazing.\u201d\n\nBooks weren\u2019t Parkin\u2019s only companions when he was young, however. He was\ndrawn to plants and amassed a collection of cacti in particular. He marveled\nat how they required only sun and just a bit of water to thrive. It led him to\nwonder about the underlying biology.\n\n\u201cI find nature so beautiful and incredible,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to understand\nhow it could be that such diverse forms, colors, and a multitude of shapes\ncould proliferate. Nature is so simple and yet so complex.\u201d\n\nHis fascination with the natural world led him to push the frontiers of\ntechnology and engineering, essentially to understand more of the world, he\nsays: \u201cThat\u2019s what science is for me.\u201d\n\nParkin received a scholarship to Trinity College Cambridge, in England, where\nhe studied physics and theoretical physics. He earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s\ndegrees in physics simultaneously in 1977, then earned a Ph.D. in 1980. He\nmoved to Paris to complete his postdoctoral research in organic\nsuperconductivity at the urging of his mentor Richard Friend. Two years later,\nParkin was hired by IBM.\n\n## IEEE is a voice for science and engineering\n\nAs a scientist, Parkin is acutely aware that \u201cmost people don\u2019t appreciate the\ntechnologies that sustain their lives\u2014from sewage systems, reliable\nelectricity, and clean water to inventions like the iPhone. They make our\nlives easier, but they all depend on myriad technologies that took years of\nresearch.\u201d\n\nSupporting such research, and the engineers and scientists behind it, is why\nhe continues to be part of IEEE, he says, as the organization is a voice for\nscience.\n\n\u201cWe need more representation of how important science and engineering are to\nsolving the world\u2019s challenges,\u201d Parkin says. \u201cThey are a major key to making\nthe world a better place.\u201d\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * This Lockheed Martin Researcher\u2019s Work on UAVs Saves Lives \u203a\n  * Spintronic Memories to Revolutionize Data Storage \u203a\n  * The Engineer Behind Samsung\u2019s Speech Recognition Software \u203a\n\ndraper prizeieee member newsmagnetic disk drivesphysicsspintronicstype:ti\n\nJulianne Pepitone\n\nJulianne Pepitone is a freelance journalist who reports via text, video, and\ntelevision.
