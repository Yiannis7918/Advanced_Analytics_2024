Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nThe California Independent System Operator is proposing $6.1 billion in\ntransmission projects, mainly to help deliver offshore wind to customers,\naccording to a draft transmission plan released Monday.\n\nTransmission projects to access clean energy resources total about $4.6\nbillion and are all in Pacific Gas & Electric\u2019s service territory.\nReliability-driven projects total about $1.5 billion.\n\nTwo projects in northern California \u2014 costing an estimated $2.7 billion and\n$1.4 billion \u2014 would be open to competitive bidding, according to the draft\nplan.\n\nThe plan is based on projections that California will need to add more than 85\nGW by 2035 to meet its clean energy goals. The grid operator expects the\nprojects, if approved, will be built over the next eight to 10 years.\n\nCAISO said the draft plan will provide access to more than 38 GW of new solar,\nincluding in Nevada and Arizona, as well as 21 GW of geothermal capacity,\nmainly in the Imperial Valley and southern Nevada.\n\nThe plan would also allow more than 5.6 GW of wind imports from Idaho, Wyoming\nand New Mexico and more than 4.7 GW of offshore wind off the state\u2019s northern\ncoast.\n\nLicensed with permission from the California ISO. Any statements, conclusions,\nsummaries or other commentaries expressed herein do not reflect the opinions\nor endorsement of the California ISO.\n\nPermission granted by California Independent System Operator\n\nCAISO said while developing its transmission plan it reviewed the proposed\nPacific Transmission Expansion project \u2014 a 500-kV high-voltage, direct current\nproject from the Diablo Canyon 500-kV substation to 230-kV substations in the\nLos Angeles Basin.\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t include the project in the proposed plan because the Los\nAngeles Department of Water and Power hasn\u2019t made a decision on whether it\nwants to pursue it, CAISO said.\n\nThe project could provide access to offshore wind, relieve congestion on Path\n26 and reduce LADWP\u2019s gas-fired generation needs. \u201cThe ISO will continue to\nexplore gas-fired generation retirement plans with the [California Public\nUtilities Commission] and work with LADWP on potential collaborations in the\nnext planning cycle,\u201d the grid operator said.\n\nAs it has in previous planning cycles, CAISO considered using grid-enhancing\ntechnologies to improve the existing transmission system. The proposal\nincludes a phase-shifting transformer to provide flow control to bolster grid\nresilience in northern California.\n\nThe draft plan is slated to be discussed at an April 9 meeting and could be\nvoted on by CAISO\u2019s board in May. The board approved $7.3 billion in\ntransmission projects last year.\n\nThe draft plan was developed in close coordination with the CPUC and the\nCalifornia Energy Commission, according to CAISO.\n\nAs part of an agreement between the agencies, CAISO will develop a final\ntransmission plan, initiate the transmission projects and tell the power\nsector which geographic zones are being targeted for transmission projects\nalong with how much capacity will be available in those zones, the grid\noperator said.\n\nThe CPUC will then direct load-serving entities to focus their energy\nprocurement on those transmission zones and CAISO will give greater priority\nto interconnection requests in those zones, the grid operator said.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated with a map of CAISO's proposed\ntransmission plan.\n\n### Recommended Reading\n\n  * California\u2019s \u2018zonal\u2019 approach could revamp clean energy planning, shrink interconnection queue: experts By Kavya Balaraman \u2022 May 23, 2023\n  * CAISO 2022-2023 Transmission Plan California Independent System Operator\n\n  * post\n  * share\n  * tweet\n  * print\n  * email\n  * license\n\nFiled Under: Transmission & Distribution, Renewables, Energy Storage\n\n### Utility Dive news delivered to your inbox\n\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n### Editors' picks\n\n  * 4kodiak via Getty Images\n\n### Arizona\u2019s chief utility regulator bashes ESG, says it\u2019s not a factor when\nweighing utility plans\n\nSolar and wind resources may be cheaper, but the head of the Arizona\nCorporation Commission said fossil fuels \u201cwill continue to play a critical\nrole in the delivery of reliable, affordable power.\u201d\n\nBy Robert Walton \u2022 Dec. 12, 2023\n\n  * Explore the Trendline\u2794\n\nYujin Kim, Industry Dive\n\nTrendline\n\n### Electrification and EVs\n\nTransportation electrification is getting a major boost from the Inflation\nReduction Act as well as various federal, state and local policies.
