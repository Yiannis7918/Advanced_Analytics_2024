File\n\nNITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant on Tuesday said it is difficult to carry out tough\nreforms in India as there is \u2018too much of democracy\u2019, and emphasised that more\nreforms are needed make the country competitive.\n\nAddressing a virtual event organised by Swarajya magazine, Mr. Kant said for\nthe first time, the Centre has carried out hard reforms across sectors,\nincluding mining, coal, labour, agriculture, and the next wave of reforms must\nbe pushed by the states.\n\n\u201cTough reforms are very difficult in the Indian context, we have too much of\ndemocracy...You needed political will to carry out these reforms (mining,\ncoal, labour, agriculture) and many more reforms still need to be done,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nIt is not easy to compete against China without hard reforms, Mr. Kant said.\n\n\u201cThis government has demonstrated political will to carry out hard reforms ,\u201d\nhe added.\n\nThe NITI Aayog CEO stressed that the next wave of reforms must come from\nStates.\n\n\u201cIf 10-12 States will grow at higher rates, then there is no reason why India\nwon\u2019t grow at higher rates. We have asked Union Territories to privatise\ndiscoms. Discoms must become far more competitive and provide cheap power,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nReplying to a question on protests by farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana,\nagainst the Centre\u2019s new farm laws, Mr. Kant said the agriculture sector needs\nreforms.\n\n\u201cIt is very important to understand this that MSPs (minimum support price)\nwill be there, mandis will remain...farmers must have a choice to sell their\nproducts as they benefit out of this,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn sourcing of raw material for manufacturing electric batteries in India, Mr.\nKant pointed out that lithium (which is used for manufacturing batteries) is\navailable in large quantities across the world, including Australia.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t anticipate any shortage of lithium,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Modi government\u2019s \u2018Aatmanirbhar Bharat\u2019 initiative, he said it is not about\nlooking inwards, but unleashing the potential of Indian companies.\n\nThe government has identified 10 champion sectors for production-linked\nincentives (PLI) scheme and these sectors will play a major role in making\nIndia a manufacturing hub, and give the country economies of scale, Mr. Kant\nsaid.\n\n\u201cThe PLI scheme is going to provide a huge opportunity to these sectors for\n4-5 years to export,\u201d he added.\n\nNoting that India must technologically leapfrog, Mr. Kant said it is important\nfor the country to get into sunrise industries.\n\nMr. Kant also noted that there is a need to bring down logistics costs.\n\nThe country must also embark on sustained and well planned urbanisation which\nis the next big driver of growth, he said.\n\nMr. Kant pointed out that the government support so far was across 90% of\nproduct lines and to 86% of exporters, and yet India\u2019s exports were not\ngrowing.\n\n\u201cWe need to create an ecosystem to enable private enterprises to thrive at the\nglobal platform,\u201d he said.\n\n  * Copy link\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Telegram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Reddit\n\nRemove SEE ALL\n\n### Related Topics\n\neconomy, business and finance\n\n### Popular\n\n  1.
