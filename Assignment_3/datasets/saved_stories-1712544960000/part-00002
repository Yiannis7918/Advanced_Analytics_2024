My family has awaited this one for decades: an eclipse we wouldn't\nneed to chase, passing over my hometown! Indeed a total solar eclipse is\nsomething worth chasing, if one has the means. If all goes as planned, this\nwill be the seventh total eclipse that I've seen. Pardon my snobbery, but if\nyou see only the partial phase of this or any other eclipse, you really did\nnot see the eclipse!\n\nThe umbra will make its first major landfall shortly after 11 AM local time\nnear Mazatl\u00e1n, Sinaloa, Mexico and about an hour and a half later will head\nout to sea off the coast of Newfoundland. Scroll below to follow the path of\nthe eclipse as it crosses the continent.\n\nEclipse and elevation data by NASA. Base map data and land cover colors from\nNatural Earth/Tom Patterson.\n\nThe shadow will move quickly\u2014probably not as quickly as you scrolled through\nthat map, but quickly nonetheless! Thus, totality is fleeting. Its duration\ndepends on several factors, but the only one where we have any control is how\nclose we are to the center of the umbra. Simply being in the path is not\nenough for the best experience! For example, look at the Dallas-Fort Worth\nmetroplex, the largest urban area in the path of this eclipse. Although nearly\nthe whole area will see a total eclipse, it will last only a brief moment on\none side and more than four minuntes on the other.\n\nBesides major cities in Texas, the path of totality notably includes cities in\nthe eastern Midwest and Great Lakes regions. Some 42 million people live in\nthe path of totality, and an additional 35 million or so live within 50 miles\nof the path. Altogether, this eclipse is fairly accessible to large portions\nof the population in the United States and Canada. If you are among them and\nhave the means, make a plan to see it!\n\nOf course, whether or not you'll see the eclipse, even in the path of\ntotality, depends on clouds. Generally speaking, the southwestern part of the\npath has better chances for clear skies. I'll direct you elsewhere for\nexpertise on the subject. You can read about weather prospects in extreme\ndetail from Jay Anderson, the Eclipsophile. If you're serious about seeing\nthis eclipse, be prepared to travel on only a few days' notice based on\nweather forecasts!\n\nMy eclipse-chasing family luckily has never been entirely clouded out\u2014in 16\neclipses for my dad!\u2014though there have been some close calls, including two of\nthe ones I saw in 1991 and 1999.\n\nIf you look carefully at the above map of my eclipses, you might spot two\npairs of paths that look similar. As rare as eclipses are, they do occur\nregularly and, in a way, repeat themselves. The saros is a period of 18ish\nyears after which the \"same\" eclipse will occur, shifted to a different part\nof the world. I won't attempt to explain this, and will only note, in the map\nbelow, the prior eclipses that \"match\" the recent and upcoming eclipses in the\nUnited States. 1999 and 2017 is one of the pairs that I've seen; the other is\n2001 and 2019.\n\n###\n\nThe eclipse experience\n\nI mentioned earlier that seeing a partial eclipse doesn't count, and perhaps\nyou've noticed that none of my maps include the penumbral areas\u2014where the moon\nonly partially blocks the sun\u2014of the upcoming eclipse. Looking through a\nviewer at the sun with a bite taken out of it is interesting, sure, but it's\nvery unlike the experience of a total eclipse.\n\nFor one thing, the sun is still very bright even when most of it is covered! I\ntook the photo below less than one minute before totality in 2019, when the\nsun was reduced to a mere sliver in the sky, and in the photo it's still...\nwell, kind of sunny.\n\nEven if this is new to you, you've probably seen photos of total eclipses\n(some more of mine are below) and are generally aware of what the experience\nis\u2014the \"diamond ring\" effect as the total phase begins and ends, the 360o\ntwighlight, the wispy corona of the sun, the confused noises of animals. I can\nonly say that it's beautiful and awe-inspiring, and worth some effort to see.\n\nI leave you with a tip from my experiences. If you're thinking of getting some\ngood photos of the eclipse, try this approach: don't! You only get a few\nminutes to enjoy this; don't waste them looking through a screen or lens,\nespecially if this is your first time.\n\nI've made sure to set up my camera so that I can take photos without having to\nlook at it, even if it involves a little duct tape!\n\n###\n\nEnjoy!\n\n", "frontpage": true}
