Stern (Copied from my notes of 24 September 1992; later appeared\nin Physics Today, no. 5, p. 63, 1993)\n\nLast night I picked up a paperback lying around the house, \"All I Really Need\nto Know I Learned in Kindergarten\" by Robert Fulghum. Years ago, when it\ntopped the best-seller list, it somehow passed me by (but not my wife, she\nmust have brought it home). Now it was a revelation: pithy essays, full of\ngoodwill. The first of them listed Fulghum's personal credo, all the things he\nreally needed to know, the ones he learned in kindergarten. You probably have\nseen that list.What is a physicist's credo? What are the things a physicist\nneeds to know? After a while I compiled a list, and here it is. (Your list\nmight differ--my interest is in theory.) None were learned in kindergarten, in\nfact none were part of my university or graduate curriculum.Keep notes, even\nwhile listening. Memory fades, what is written down stays yours.Never tell\nyourself you understand when you don't (what's the meaning of F = ma unless\nyou can clearly define F and m?). And if you don't understand, struggle to do\nso. Consult books, friends, common sense. Keep notes as you do.If in the end\nyou still don't get it, write down what you have. Some day you might\ncontinue.Rough notes are but a fading latent image. Transcribe them, don't\nwait. Edit what you produce, illustrate it, use neat handwriting or better\nstill, type. The material is hard enough, anything that smoothes its retrieval\nis great help.Spend time to arrange ideas in your mind and notes: the pattern\nis just as important as the material. Awareness of history helps one recognize\nthe pattern.Don't fear drudgery. No pain, no gain.However, if a piece of\ncalculation leads into an ever-denser thicket, nature probably did not intend\nyou to go that way. Look for a different approach.Don't get drawn into a big\nproject unless you have a clear idea of its final product.Give fair\ncredit.Collect references.Go for the big problems. No one cares about\npublishable petty results.Take time to select the text you study. A poor text\nwill frustrate you, a good one will make you soar. Seek one that provides\nintuitive insights.Once you understand a derivation, try to divine its\nintuitive meaning. Ideally, all you need remember are concepts, the math can\nbe added afterwards.Check dimensions and orders of magnitude.Solve\nproblems.Take your time preparing for a project. Else you may spend more time\ndoing things you did not need to do.Talk to colleagues.Take time to ask the\nexperts. They don't mind and may actually be pleased to display their\nerudition.Answer mail.If it's memorable, write it down. Keep an open notebook\nby the phone, number and date your entries.Never stop studying. Make up your\nown exercises as you go along, to prepare for the big problems.Look out for\nthe future. Make a program of what you intend to do--next month, next year, on\nthe long term. Change it as you learn more.Learn to smell out good problems.\nSkill in finding them is more important than skill in solving them (though\nboth count) and the trick is to transform puzzling data into well-posed\nproblems. Stash away partially solved puzzles for later attention.If you head\na committee, take time to make clear to yourself what it should produce.Look\nfor kindred souls. They are few and far between, and nothing is more\nprecious.Compile and write review articles. Write them with care and you might\nbecome a foremost expert in whatever they describe. Also, you are likely to\nuncover in the process one or two good research ideas, worth pursuing.  \n---  \n  \nReturn to listing of Education files\n\nAuthor and Curator: Dr. David P.
