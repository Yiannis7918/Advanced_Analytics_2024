President Emmanuel Macron has congratulated the\nresearchers on social media.\n\n\"The first images surpassed our expectations, giving after just four minutes,\nmind-blowing brain images without any artifacts, with superb tissue contrast\nand resolution, which represents a volume equivalent to a few thousand\nneurons,\" Prof. Denis Le Bihan, PhD, founding director of the NeuroSpin\nresearch facility and founder of Iseult Project of the French Alternative\nEnergies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), told AuntMinnieEurope.com on 3\nApril. \"Such images would require hours to obtain with conventional MRI\nsystems.\"\n\nThe images were acquired over a six-month period on a cohort of 20 healthy\nyoung volunteers, he explained. Extensive physiological, biological, and\ncognitive tests were performed, including genotoxic analyses, to confirm the\nsafety of the large magnetic field on humans.\n\nAccording to Le Bihan, \"With such a high resolution, we might visualize small\nintracranial vessels with a diameter of less than 0.3 mm and perivascular\nspaces, to investigate \"small scale\" diseases: perfusion deficits in chronic\nstroke, neuroinflammation in grey and white matter (e.g., multiple sclerosis,\npotential implications of small vessel inflammation in long COVID),\ndevelopmental (neuronal migration) anomalies as seen in intractable epilepsy,\nand valuable information which could be critical for treatment planning.\"\n\nThe hippocampus (Alzheimer's disease, sclerosis in intractable epilepsy) will\nbe seen with unprecedented details, he added. \"Enhanced magnetic\nsusceptibility contrast should give us more insights on diseases associated\nwith iron deposits (Parkinson's disease) for early and more specific\ndiagnosis.\"\n\nIn addition to brain anatomy, the group will now aim to implement and improve\nmethods beyond structural imaging, such as functional MRI and diffusion MRI,\nto visualize neural circuits and brain connections. An important element will\nbe investigating the relationship between brain function and underlying\nstructure at the mesoscopic level (cortical layers and columns), which could\nhide a \"neural code\" underlying our cognitive abilities, language, calculus,\netc., Le Bihan continued.\n\nThe hope is to better understand the mechanisms associated with the origin or\nthe expression of mental disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, autism,\netc. \"In some way, those defective connections result in mis-synchronizations\nin the connectome, so that such diseases might be considered brain spacetime\ndisorders. More generally, correlating the states of consciousness to the\nconnectome landscape status may also be the subject of exciting research,\" he\nnoted.\n\nThe 11.7-tesla scanner will also put MR spectroscopy \"at our fingertips for\nclinical applications, for instance for monitoring the spatiotemporal\ndistribution of lithium in patients with bipolar disorder or noninvasively\ninvestigate altered metabolic pathways, cellular homeostasis, signaling\npathways, with the potential to characterize many brain diseases (gliomas,\nneurodegeneration, etc.) and individualize treatment planning and therapy\nmonitoring of neurological disorders.\"\n\nThe project involves more than 200 people from both the CEA and partners from\nindustry and academia: Alstom (now GE), which manufactured the magnet; Siemens\nHealthineers, which installed the additional peripheral equipment in the MRI\nsystem; Guerbet, which supplied the contrast agents and used the ultrahigh-\nfield MRI platform at the CEA to assess and select compounds that demonstrate\nsignificant potential for use in humans; and the University of Freiburg in\nGermany, which developed new technologies and methods for ultrahigh-field MRI\nscans.\n\nIn a press release dated 2 April, Nicolas Boulant, PhD, now head of the Iseult\nProject and director of research at the CEA, emphasized that it would take\nseveral years of research to develop and improve acquisition methods and\nensure that the data are high quality. \"Our goal is to investigate\nneurodegenerative diseases by 2026-2030, as well as other diseases that fall\nmore under psychiatry, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Cognitive\nsciences will also be of key importance in our research.\"\n\nFor further information and to watch a video about the project, go to the CEA\nwebsite.\n\nStay in the Know\n\nDelivered right to your inbox, Aunt Minnie's newsletters.
