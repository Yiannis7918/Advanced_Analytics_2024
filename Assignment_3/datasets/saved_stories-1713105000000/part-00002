You can change the\ncamera port in the config (set to 0 by default). It's important the camera\ndoesn't move otherwise evaluation of the policy is likely to fail.\n\n### Data collection\n\nIn order to collect data simply run:\n\n    \n    \n    python record_episodes.py --task sort\n\nYou can define the name of the task you are doing and the episodes will be\nstored at data/<task>. You can also select how many episodes to collect when\nrunning the script by passing the argument --num_episodes 1 (set to 1 by\ndefault). After getting a hold of it you can easily do 20 tasks in a row.\n\nTurn on the volume of your pc-- data for each episode will be recorded after\nyou hear \"Go\" and it will stop when you hear \"Stop\".\n\n### Train policy\n\nWe slightly re-adapt Action Chunking Tranfosrmer to account for our setup. To\nstart training simply run:\n\n    \n    \n    python train.py --task sort\n\nThe policy will be saved in checkpoints/<task>.\n\n### Evaluate policy\n\nMake sure to keep the same setup while you were collecting the data. To\nevaluate the policy simply run:\n\n    \n    \n    python evaluate.py --task sort\n\n## About\n\nAction Chunking Transformer implementation for low cost robot\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nMIT license\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n54 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n4 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Jupyter Notebook 85.6%\n  * Python 14.4%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
