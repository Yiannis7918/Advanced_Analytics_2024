Do they help addicts use safely? Or do they\nnormalize lethal behavior?\n\nI went to the streets of another East Coast city to find out.\n\nThe first time I went to Philadelphia, some 20 years ago, the city was a proud\nplace. Today it is not only crime-ridden, but drug-ridden.\n\nAnd in one area in particular it is absolutely swimming in drugs and the\nmisery and the almost unfathomable misery they bring in their wake.\n\nOver the last few years the Kensington Avenue area of Philly has become\nnotorious across America.\n\nIt is not just the extremity of the scenes, but the fact that the area is\ncondensed.\n\n10\n\nNew York Post columnist Douglas Murray visited Philadelphia\u2019s notorious\nKensington neighborhood, where many drug addicts use \u201ctranq\u201d out in the open.\nDouglas Murray\n\nAll the human misery that is more widely spread out in West Coast cities like\nSan Francisco and Los Angeles here is tightly packed in. And beyond\nimagination.\n\nEach time I have visited in the past year I\u2019ve been not just appalled and\nsickened but deeply saddened by what I have seen.\n\nWalking the streets of Kensington in the daytime is dangerous enough. In the\nnightime it is a no-go area which even hardened addicts avoid unless they are\nbuying.\n\n10\n\nThe drug xylazine \u2014 also known as \u201ctranq\u201d \u2014 is commonly used in Kensington.\nAnadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nIn the middle of the day you do not just see people shooting up everywhere.\n\nYou also see people passed out everywhere, rummaging in bags for their few\nbelongings, or frozen like figures in a nightmare. Just one sign of the\npotency of the drugs now on sale here.\n\nWalking to a clinic that tries to look after some of these users a young man\nshot up in front of me. He started staggering down the street in a kind of\njerky dance.\n\nThen his body gave out and he collapsed into a heap on the pavement. I went\nover to check if he was still breathing. A teenage schoolgirl walked past.\n\n\u201cHe dead?\u201d she asked nonchalantly to me. \u201cI don\u2019t think so\u201d I told her. \u201cThey\ngotta sort this shit out\u201d she said over her shoulder as she walked on.\n\n10\n\nSarah Laurel founded Savage Sisters Recovery to help drug users in\nPhiladelphia. Douglas Murray\n\nOne of the groups that is trying to sort this out is Savage Sisters. The\ngroup\u2019s executive is a remarkable woman called Sarah Laurel.\n\nA former addict, she set up Savage Sisters to care for the people of\nKensington who are using.\n\nThe volunteers give out clean needles and the reviving drug Narcan, warm\ndrinks and care.\n\nMost importantly their volunteers tend to the wounds that addicts come in\nwith. It\u2019s not formal medical care but it is better than nothing.\n\n## see also\n\n### Docs struggling for answers as flesh-rotting \u2018zombie drug\u2019 tranq grips NY\n\nI spent a morning with them, watching the people who were coming in. Some\npassed out as they were sitting beside me.\n\nOthers came with wounds that now seem to be mainly emanating from a drug even\nmore potent and lethal than fentanyl.\n\n\u201cXylazine,\u201d also known as \u201ctranq,\u201d is the flesh-eating tranquillizer which has\nfound its way into the drug supply in Philly. Its effects are visible in the\nfrozen, statue-like position users can be seen in across the streets. But also\nin the appalling wounds which it causes in users.\n\nAt Savage Sisters I met one male addict called Paul who been using the drug\nfor a couple of years. His body was covered in huge boils and open wounds.\n\nHis head and nose were covered in other wounds and bandages. Caused \u2014 he said\n\u2014 by knocking into things as he passes out.\n\nPaul is now 29 and said he \u0301s been shooting up since he was 21 \u2014 so about 8\nyears. He claimed never to have had health issues like this until the last two\nyears.\n\n10\n\nMurray met a drug user named Paul at Savage Sisters who has been shooting up\nfor the past eight years. Douglas Murray\n\n\u201cI used to go without any sort of abscess or cyst or anything\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\nwas when the tranq came in that that was when you got wounds for the first\ntime?\u201d I asked. \u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a combination of the tranq causing\npeople to get more open wounds.\u201d\n\nAbout an hour after I had watched Paul having his wounds cleaned I saw him\nsitting on a doorstep down the road, a needle sticking out of one of his arms.\nWe waved at each other.\n\nAs it happens, his wounds weren\u2019t the worst I saw that day. Another user who\ndropped in while I was there had leg wounds worse than anything I have seen\noutside of a war-zone.\n\n10\n\nPaul\u2019s body is covered in wounds from tranq use. Douglas Murray\n\n10\n\nPaul said the boils and open wounds only started in the past two years \u2014\naround when tranq was introduced. Douglas Murray\n\nIndeed although the volunteers were doing what they could, his leg seemed to\nbe suffering from necrosis and looked like it might have to be amputated\nbefore long.\n\nLater I asked a retired local doctor about how this had developed. He said\nthat not only had the problem been growing for years, and Philly become\npractically a laboratory for new strains and potencies of drugs, but that the\nofficial hospitals had a challenge with these patients.\n\nWhen patients are brought in, having overdosed, they are often angry at being\nrevived.\n\n## see also\n\n### Up close and too personal with America\u2019s fentanyl epidemic \u2014 where New\nYork is ground zero\n\nAmong other things, they believe their \u201chigh\u201d has been interrupted. Others get\nviolent from withdrawal.\n\nThe city\u2019s professionals found it ever-harder to cope with the volume of\naddicts being brought in.\n\nAnd all the time new drugs were coming before them. In 2021 over a third of\nPhiladelphia\u2019s 1,237 recorded overdose deaths involved tranq.\n\nThis leaves volunteers like Sarah Laurel to try to cope as best they can.\n\n\u201cWe have zero human studies on Xylazine and the effect on the human body\u201d she\ntold me. \u201cSo unfortunately, because the adulteration with Xylazine began in\nPhiladelphia, Philly has been dealing with this crisis firsthand, on the\nground. With no scientific data. No medical back-up. Nothing.\u201d\n\nPeople like Sarah argue for safe-supply. In the same way that getting alcohol\nin a bar is one way of making sure you don \u0301t get moonshine, so \u2014 such\nactivists say \u2014 providing safe-supply of heroin and other drugs will mean\ndrugs can be tested for lethal toxins.\n\nBut isn\u2019t it all lethal? Isn\u2019t even the idea of \u201csafe\u201d heroin an oxymoron?\n\n10\n\nMurray touring Kensington with Philadelphia Republican mayoral candidate David\nOh. Douglas Murray\n\nRepublican Mayoral candidate David Oh certainly thinks so. To people who say\nthere isn\u2019t a policing way out of this problem he has a very straightforward\nanswer: it hasn\u2019t been tried.\n\nJust as I saw police sitting a few yards from someone shooting up fentanyl on\nthe streets of Washington Heights, so on Kensington Avenue the police and\nambulances are sometimes there.\n\nBut what authorities do exist just seem to sit by as this scene of American\napocalypse plays out in front of them.\n\nThe human cost of this is of course incalculable.\n\nMost countries would regard more than 100,000 deaths a year from anything as\nbeing a subject for concern. But not, it seems, in the US in 2024.\n\n10\n\nOh doesn\u2019t support the idea of \u201csafe-supply\u201d heroin for drug users. Douglas\nMurray\n\nPerhaps a better way of thinking of it is to remember that this is not just\n100,000 human tragedies, but hundreds of thousands \u2014 if not millions \u2014 more.\nBecause every user creates a wave of tragedy.\n\nIn Philly I spent a day searching the streets with a woman called Esther Ann\n(a middle school lunch lady originally from New Jersey).\n\nWe connected through one of the many Facebook groups in which relatives of\npeople who have gone missing on Kensington Avenue try to get information on\ntheir loved ones.\n\nEsther Ann was searching for the mother of her granddaughter. Talitha \u2014 or Tal\n\u2014 has been missing for a couple of years now.\n\n10\n\nEsther Ann searched Kensington for the missing mother of her granddaughter.\nDouglas Murray\n\nEsther spends part of her days desperately trying to find information online\nthat might connect the family again.\n\nWe walked the streets, with Esther showing a photo of her relative to various\npassersby, users and others. She held up a photo to passing cars. Some\nshrugged and said they didn\u2019t recognize her. Others had a bleary recollection\nof seeing Tal.\n\nEventually we found one addict who said they\u2019d seen her come to this bit of\nPhiladelphia from another part of the area.\n\nBut the woman said Tal came here but didn\u2019t like staying in the area after\ndark. Like others she went elsewhere to use.\n\n10\n\nDrug addicts sitting on the sidewalks in Kensington last July. Photo by Fatih\nAktas/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nAs Esther wept for her relative she reflected on her feelings on not seeing\nher.\n\n\u201cPart of me felt relieved,\u201d she said at the end of the day, crying. \u201cBut I\nwanted to find her. I didn\u2019t know what kind of condition she would be in. I\nhope to see her again. And I hope my granddaughter gets to see her again.\u201d\n\nThis is the world between the law and \u201csafe supply.\u201d A city where people die\nor almost die in the street in front of children all day and night long.\n\nWhat do you think? Post a comment.\n\nA place where anyone can come and get addicted to substances whose strength is\nsuch that they will develop wounds that will reek and explode.\n\nBut Philadelphia has got used to it. As the rest of the country has got used\nto it. All in different ways, and to different extremes.\n\nStill, if you want to see how the bottom falls out of a city and the abnormal\nbecomes normal, make a trip to Philly someday.\n\nAnd see what any other city in America could become. If it makes the wrong\nchoices.\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * addiction\n  * drugs\n  * fentanyl\n  * philadelphia\n  * tranq\n  * 4/11/24\n\nRead Next Jill Biden's foreign policy influence: Letters to the Edit...\n\n## Columnists\n\n  * ### \n\nMichael Goodwin\n\n#### NPR, New York Times are in immense turmoil with the world on the verge of\nglobal conflict\n\n  * ### \n\nAdam B.
