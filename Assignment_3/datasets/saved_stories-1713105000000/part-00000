These issues\nincluded BSODs, black screens, and more problems. A major reason for the\nexcitement around this update was the fact that Microsoft was rolling out its\nMoment 5 feature update to more users.\n\nInterestingly, Microsoft probably took notice of these user troubles, and then\nthe KB5035942 update was later re-released to user PCs. It was assumed that\nperhaps Microsoft might have fixed some of the bugs plaguing users.\n\nWith the latest Windows 11 Patch Tuesday for April 2024, KB5036893, Microsoft\nhas now rolled out the Moment 5 update to everyone. However, as is often the\ncase, users are now reporting post-installation issues with this.\n\nThe reports come from various forums online, including Microsoft's own\nCommunity and Reddit, among other places. While buggy optional updates are one\nthing, Patch Tuesdays are major releases as they are supposed to address\nsecurity vulnerabilities and hence users find themselves far more annoyed when\na Patch Tuesday has some breaking bugs.\n\nUsers report they are unable to uninstall Edge from their PCs even though they\nare from Europe. In case you haven't been following, Microsoft made it\npossible to uninstall Edge and the Bing web search due to the E.U. DMA\ncompliance changes.\n\nThe user Alex-Row from Reddit writes:\n\n> After this update (I'm from Europe) now in Microsoft Edge app comes out to\n> uninstall, click unistall but then takes me to applications menu but doesnt\n> let me uninstall it, the option is blank :\\ and also in applications copilot\n> now appears here (dont let unistall either) but apparently it is nowhere\n> (neither in taskbar options nor in group policies).\n>\n> Bing search also appears in applications but let me uninstall it.\n\nAnother user writes:\n\n> I keep getting \"Install error - 0x800705b9\" no matter how many times I\n> retry. I tried manually installing the update through the Microsoft catalog\n> and I tried doing a repair install using a Windows 11 .iso file and both\n> give me \"Windows installation failed\" error messages.\n\nYet another user Flo-TPG notes multiple issues with the update related to PC\nperformance, VPNs and TPM, Outlook 365:\n\n> KB5036893 Windows 11 April 2024 renders HP Dragonfly G1 unsuasble slow:\n>\n> Since the latest update, two HP Dragonfly G1 users reported issues:\n>\n>   * machine is horrible slow:\n>\n>     * lsass.exe high cpu\n>     * lsass.exe causes excessive disk writes:\n>   * VPNs with TPM backed certificates won't work anymore:\n>\n>     * A certificate could not be found that can be used with this Extensible\n> Authentication Protocol.\n>   * Outlook 365 doesn't start with \"Something went wrong. [1001]\"\n>\n>     * Error Tag: 86q85 Error Code: -2146892987\n>     * Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window. The\n> set of folders cannot be opened. The file\n> C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Outlook\\USERNAME@DOMAIN.com.ost\n> cannot be accessed. You must connect to Microsoft Exchange at least once\n> before you can use your Outlook data file (ost).\n>\n\nThe slowdown issue does not seem like a few isolated cases as hrundig, a\nMicrosoft community forum member, also noted a slowdown bug. They write:\n\n> KB5036893 update issues\n>\n> Files and folders on the desktop stopped opening after clicking. They open\n> eventually but after a long delay of 5 minutes!\n>\n> After that, everything goes back to normal.\n\nMoving on from 11, users on Windows 10 with the latest March 2024 Patch\nTuesday update KB5036892 also report installation failures with the error code\n\"0x8007000d.\" Chuck Zmudzinski from the Microsoft community forum writes:\n\n> I update successfully with automatic updates every month, usually with no\n> problem. But this month, the cumulative update KB5036892 will not install.\n> This is the message I get:\n>\n> Some update files are missing or have problems. We'll try to download the\n> update again later. Error code: (0x8007000d)\n>\n> I tried the following to fix it:\n>\n>   * Ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter\n>   * Tried the standalone installer using the download from the Microsoft\n> Update Catalog for KB5036892\n>   * Ran sfc /scannow and verified there are no integrity problems in system\n> files\n>   * Ran the Shawn Brink WuReset2.0.bat script available on\n> answers.microsoft.com\n>\n\n>\n> After each fix listed above, I rebooted and ran Windows Update or the\n> standalone installer again, but I always get the same error message listed\n> above, with error code 0x8007000d.\n\nThe query has been upvoted by 15 people at the time of writing.\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * Microsoft\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 10\n  * Patch tuesday\n  * Windows bugs\n  * Windows bug\n  * Windows 11 bugs\n  * Windows 11 issues\n  * Windows 10 bugs\n  * Windows 10 bug\n  * Kb5036893\n  * Kb5036892\n  * 0x800705b9\n  * 0x8007000d\n  * Slowdown\n  * Slow\n  * Hangs\n\nLike\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nReport a problem with article\n\nNext Article\n\n### Microsoft finally lifts two-year old block preventing Windows 10 users\nfrom upgrading to 11\n\nPrevious Article\n\n### Microsoft starts stuffing ads in the Windows 11 Start menu\n\n### Related Stories\n\n### Microsoft: We are working on KB5034441/KB5034440 \"0x80070643 -\nERROR_INSTALL_FAILURE\" fix\n\nSayan Sen \u00b7 Jan 15, 2024 with 19 comment s\n\n### Microsoft acknowledges it's not HP who's auto-installing printer Smart app\non your Windows\n\nSayan Sen \u00b7 Dec 8, 2023 with 12 comment s\n\n### As Microsoft also pushes it to Windows 10, buggy Copilot puts the brakes\non Windows 11 23H2\n\nSayan Sen \u00b7 Dec 1, 2023 with 11 comment s\n\n### Microsoft investigates Windows (KB5029351, KB5029331) Unsupported\nProcessor BSOD crashes\n\nSayan Sen \u00b7 Aug 24, 2023 with 4 comment s\n\nFrom the WebPowered by ZergNet\n\nIf Hitler Had Won WW2, These Were His Plans For The US\n\nNever, Ever Kill A Spider In Your House.
