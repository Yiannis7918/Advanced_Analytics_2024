Credit:\nTyler Coale\n\nModern biology textbooks assert that only bacteria can take nitrogen from the\natmosphere and convert it into a form that is usable for life. Plants that fix\nnitrogen, such as legumes, do so by harboring symbiotic bacteria in root\nnodules. But a recent discovery upends that rule.\n\nIn two recent papers, an international team of scientists describes the first\nknown nitrogen-fixing organelle within a eukaryotic cell. The organelle is the\nfourth example in history of primary endosymbiosis\u2014the process by which a\nprokaryotic cell is engulfed by a eukaryotic cell and evolves beyond symbiosis\ninto an organelle.\n\n\"It's very rare that organelles arise from these types of things,\" said Tyler\nCoale, a postdoctoral scholar at UC Santa Cruz and first author on one of two\nrecent papers. \"The first time we think it happened, it gave rise to all\ncomplex life. Everything more complicated than a bacterial cell owes its\nexistence to that event,\" he said, referring to the origins of the\nmitochondria. \"A billion years ago or so, it happened again with the\nchloroplast, and that gave us plants,\" Coale said.\n\nThe third known instance involves a microbe similar to a chloroplast. The\nnewest discovery is the first example of a nitrogen-fixing organelle, which\nthe researchers are calling a nitroplast.\n\n## A decades-long mystery\n\nThe discovery of the organelle involved a bit of luck and decades of work. In\n1998, Jonathan Zehr, a UC Santa Cruz distinguished professor of marine\nsciences, found a short DNA sequence of what appeared to be from an unknown\nnitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium in Pacific Ocean seawater. Zehr and colleagues\nspent years studying the mystery organism, which they called UCYN-A.\n\nAt the same time, Kyoko Hagino, a paleontologist at Kochi University in Japan,\nwas painstakingly trying to culture a marine alga. It turned out to be the\nhost organism for UCYN-A. It took her over 300 sampling expeditions and more\nthan a decade, but Hagino eventually successfully grew the alga in culture,\nallowing other researchers to begin studying UCYN-A and its marine alga host\ntogether in the lab.\n\nFor years, the scientists considered UCYN-A an endosymbiont that was closely\nassociated with an alga. But the two recent papers suggest that UCYN-A has co-\nevolved with its host past symbiosis and now fits criteria for an organelle.\n\n## Organelle origins\n\nIn a paper published in Cell in March 2024, Zehr and colleagues from the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Institut de Ci\u00e8ncies del Mar in\nBarcelona and the University of Rhode Island show that the size ratio between\nUCYN-A and their algal hosts is similar across different species of the marine\nhaptophyte algae Braarudosphaera bigelowii.\n\nThe researchers use a model to demonstrate that the growth of the host cell\nand UCYN-A are controlled by the exchange of nutrients. Their metabolisms are\nlinked. This synchronization in growth rates led the researchers to call\nUCYN-A \"organelle-like.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what happens with organelles,\" said Zehr. \"If you look at the\nmitochondria and the chloroplast, it's the same thing: they scale with the\ncell.\"\n\nA soft x-ray tomography image shows B. bigelowii cell division, with the\nnitroplasts (UCYN-A) in cyan. Credit: Valentina Loconte\n\nBut the scientists did not confidently call UCYN-A an organelle until\nconfirming other lines of evidence. In the cover article of the journal\nScience, published today, Zehr, Coale, Kendra Turk-Kubo and Wing Kwan Esther\nMak from UC Santa Cruz, and collaborators from the University of California,\nSan Francisco, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, National Taiwan\nOcean University, and Kochi University in Japan show that UCYN-A imports\nproteins from its host cells.\n\n\"That's one of the hallmarks of something moving from an endosymbiont to an\norganelle,\" said Zehr. \"They start throwing away pieces of DNA, and their\ngenomes get smaller and smaller, and they start depending on the mother cell\nfor those gene products\u2014or the protein itself\u2014to be transported into the\ncell.\"\n\nCoale worked on the proteomics for the study. He compared the proteins found\nwithin isolated UCYN-A with those found in the entire algal host cell. He\nfound that the host cell makes proteins and labels them with a specific amino\nacid sequence, which tells the cell to send them to the nitroplast. The\nnitroplast then imports the proteins and uses them. Coale identified the\nfunction of some of the proteins, and they fill gaps in certain pathways\nwithin UCYN-A.\n\n\"It's kind of like this magical jigsaw puzzle that actually fits together and\nworks,\" said Zehr.\n\nIn the same paper, researchers from UCSF show that UCYN-A replicates in\nsynchrony with the alga cell and is inherited like other organelles.\n\n## Changing perspectives\n\nThese independent lines of evidence leave little doubt that UCYN-A has\nsurpassed the role of a symbiont. And while mitochondria and chloroplasts\nevolved billions of years ago, the nitroplast appears to have evolved about\n100 million years ago, providing scientists with a new, more recent\nperspective on organellogenesis.\n\nThe organelle also provides insight into ocean ecosystems. All organisms need\nnitrogen in a biologically usable form, and UCYN-A is globally important for\nits ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. Researchers have found it\neverywhere from the tropics to the Arctic Ocean, and it fixes a significant\namount of nitrogen.\n\n\"It's not just another player,\" said Zehr.\n\nThe discovery also has the potential to change agriculture. The ability to\nsynthesize ammonia fertilizers from atmospheric nitrogen allowed\nagriculture\u2014and the world population\u2014to take off in the early 20th century.\nKnown as the Haber-Bosch process, it makes possible about 50% of the world's\nfood production. It also creates enormous amounts of carbon dioxide: about\n1.4% of global emissions come from the process. For decades, researchers have\ntried to figure out a way to incorporate natural nitrogen fixation into\nagriculture.\n\n\"This system is a new perspective on nitrogen fixation, and it might provide\nclues into how such an organelle could be engineered into crop plants,\" said\nCoale.\n\nBut plenty of questions about UCYN-A and its algal host remain unanswered. The\nresearchers plan to delve deeper into how UCYN-A and the alga operate and\nstudy different strains.\n\nKendra Turk-Kubo, an assistant professor at UC Santa Cruz, will continue the\nresearch in her new lab. Zehr expects scientists will find other organisms\nwith evolutionary stories similar to UCYN-A, but as the first of its kind,\nthis discovery is one for the textbooks.\n\nMore information: Tyler H.
