Over 44\ndays, more than 500 million people\u2014or 65 percent of the country\u2019s nearly one\nbillion eligible voters\u2014are expected to participate. The exercise will be\nspectacular, with ballots printed in over a dozen languages and distributed\nfrom islands to remote mountain communities. But the result is not really in\ndoubt. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party are\nexpected to return to power for a third term.\n\nThe BJP\u2019s margin is likely to be sizable. Modi\u2019s approval ratings are high,\nand the party leads in every poll. And yet the BJP has gone into overdrive,\nusing any means possible to subdue an already weak opposition. It has, most\nnotably, turned the Enforcement Directorate, a body designed to investigate\nfinancial crimes, into a vehicle for prosecuting opposition politicians. Its\nlatest and perhaps highest-profile target is Arvind Kejriwal, the chief\nminister of Delhi, who rose to public prominence leading an anticorruption\nmovement. He was arrested in March on graft charges and is now running his\ngovernment from jail.\n\nAt first, these measures may seem surprising. To win reelection, the BJP does\nnot need to imprison Kejriwal or any other opponent. Such steps, which have\ncreated many controversies, seem gratuitous at best and risky at\nworst\u2014needless gambles for a party cruising to victory.\n\n### Stay informed.\n\nIn-depth analysis delivered weekly.\n\n#### Thank you for signing up. Stay tuned for the latest from Foreign Affairs.\n\nBut the BJP is not like most parties. Its goal is not just to win elections\nand pass discrete policies: the party sees political power as a means to a\nmuch grander end. The BJP is a Hindu nationalist organization that aims to\ncompletely restructure the Indian state as a Hindu nation. It wants to put\nHinduism at the center of public life. It wants to make full Indian\ncitizenship contingent on being Hindu. It has even set in motion laws that\nthreaten many of the country\u2019s Muslims with detention and eviction.\n\nTo make these bigger changes, the BJP must do more than just win a third term.\nIt has to win big, with majorities large enough to completely steamroll the\ncountry\u2019s opposition.\n\n### A CENTURY IN THE MAKING\n\nHindu nationalism may seem like an old ideology. It is not. It began to take\nshape in the 1920s in the work of the activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. The\nBritish government had imprisoned him for over a decade for his opposition to\ncolonial rule. Following several mercy petitions asking for forgiveness,\nSavarkar was released in 1924 after he pledged undying allegiance to the\nUnited Kingdom. For the rest of his life, he never betrayed this oath. Instead\nof agitating against colonialism, Savarkar stuck to a habit he acquired in\nprison: writing about Hindus and Muslims in a way that sought to highlight the\nantipathy between India\u2019s two largest religious communities and make their\ndifferences irreconcilable.\n\nSavarkar was an atheist, but that was no obstacle to his mission. He saw\nHinduness, or \u201cHindutva\u201d\u2014as he termed it\u2014as a cultural source of identity. In\nhis book on Hindutva, published in 1923, Savarkar argued that India should\nbelong to this nation of Hindus, who considered the subcontinent both their\nfatherland and their holy land. Savarkar believed that Muslims and Christians\ncould not belong to this nation. \u201cHindusthan\u201d may be their fatherland, he\nwrote, \u201cyet it is not to them a holy land too.\u201d\n\nSavarkar\u2019s ideas quickly caught on. In 1925, a group of high-caste Hindus\nfounded the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, an organization dedicated to creating\nthe nation Savarkar imagined. The RSS saw India as an exclusively Hindu nation\nand argued that Christians and Muslims had no place in it. One of the founders\nof the organization, Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, argued that Muslims were \u201cyavana\nsnakes,\u201d borrowing an archaic term for foreigners.\n\n> The BJP is not like most parties.\n\nBy the early 1930s, the RSS had gathered enough strength to send a delegation\nto Italy to meet with its leader, Benito Mussolini, and learn the art of cadre\nbuilding from his fascist organization. Under the leadership of M. S.\nGolwalkar, Hedgewar\u2019s successor, the group patterned itself on Mussolini\u2019s\nparty, creating a system of educational centers where members lived, studied,\nand trained, replete with uniforms and drills. Golwalkar also learned from\nEuropean fascists\u2019 views on minorities. In his writings, he claimed that the\nfinal solution in Germany was a model for how India should treat its own\nminority groups. (Modi has written and spoken of Golwalkar as one of his\nguiding lights.)\n\nSuch exclusionary views ensured that the RSS had little or no participation in\nIndia\u2019s freedom struggle, which enjoyed the broad support of both Hindus and\nMuslims. The group was further marginalized after an RSS member assassinated\nMahatma Gandhi in 1948. And it was decidedly uninvolved in the debates that\nled to the writing of the Indian constitution, which was adopted in 1950. As\nlate as 1966, the RSS made clear its criticism of the founding document. The\nconstitution \u201cis just a cumbersome and heterogeneous piecing together of\nvarious articles from various Constitutions of Western countries,\u201d Golwalkar\nwrote. \u201cIt has absolutely nothing which can be called our own.\u201d\n\nBut gradually, the group began to enter Indian politics. In 1951, it founded\nthe Jan Sangh\u2014a precursor to the BJP\u2014which contested and won seats in\nParliament. Its members joined the bureaucracy, universities, and other\nprominent institutions. Although the RSS never concealed its vision of what\nIndia should be, its vast array of sympathizers lived out a variant of what\nthe Polish-American writer Czeslaw Milosz described as ketman: they publicly\naccepted and even endorsed the country\u2019s prevailing secular norms while\nconcealing their true beliefs.\n\nThis strategy allowed the Jan Sangh to work closely with mainstream political\ngroups, including ones that termed themselves socialists and progressives.\nSoon, the party was sharing power with such outfits at the provincial level.\nAfter the 1977 elections, which booted the Indian National Congress from\ngovernment for the first time since independence, the RSS affiliate briefly\nshared political power as a junior partner in a diverse alliance. The\ncoalition soon collapsed, and the Jan Sangh evaporated. But in 1980, the RSS\nset up a new political wing: the BJP. And in 1998, the party placed first in\nthe national elections. An RSS-trained politician, Atal Bihari Vajpayee,\nbecame India\u2019s prime minister.\n\n> The BJP may be carrying out the largest marginalization in human history.\n\nDuring Vajpayee\u2019s tenure, the BJP sought to allay any apprehension that it\nwould act according to the stated desires of its parent organization. It\nworked well within the constitutional mandate, contesting elections without\nfoul play and selecting candidates who did not publicly articulate the RSS\u2019s\ndisdain for the constitution. But in hindsight, it is clear Vajpayee was\nconstrained only by legislative math. The BJP and its ideological partners did\nnot have a majority in Parliament, so they had to work in coalition with more\nmoderate groups.\n\nThat changed when the BJP came to power in 2014 with a majority\u2014and under the\nleadership of Modi. This prime minister was a dyed-in-the-wool Hindu\nnationalist, one who began volunteering for the RSS as a child. He then became\na pracharak, a formal organizer for the group, serving until 1985. The RSS\neventually seconded Modi to the BJP, where he quickly rose up the ranks. In\n2001, he was elected chief minister of the Indian state of Gujarat. Under his\ntenure, Hindu mobs carried out a pogrom there, killing at least 800 Muslims.\nThe police, which reported to Modi\u2019s government, largely stood aside.\n\nModi carried RSS ideology with him into national leadership. Over his ten\nyears in office, the prime minister has successfully relegated Muslims to\nsecond-class status in Indian society. He has, for example, passed laws that\ncould strip many Muslims of their citizenship. His party has fielded just one\nMuslim candidate in the 2024 elections, from a district where Muslims make up\nover 70 percent of the population, depriving the religious group of\nrepresentation in government. And BJP-controlled states have enacted bills\nthat make it extremely difficult for Hindus and Muslims to marry, for anyone\nto convert to Islam, and for Muslims to purchase property in Hindu-dominated\nareas. Many of the bills\u2019 provisions also affect Christians. Hindus may make\nup 80 percent of India\u2019s population, but given its size, the number of people\naffected by the BJP\u2019s discrimination exceeds 200 million. The party may well\nbe carrying out the largest marginalization in human history.\n\nThe discrimination has accelerated the longer Modi has stayed in power. Since\nwinning reelection in 2019, his government has advanced many large-scale legal\nchanges that were once considered out of bounds for even hardcore Hindu\nnationalists. Modi has, for instance, revoked the special status of\nKashmir\u2014once India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state. (The government also divided\nthe state in half and relegated the resulting parts to \u201cunion territories\u201d run\nby the federal government.) The government has overseen the construction of a\nHindu temple atop the ruins of a medieval mosque that an RSS-affiliated mob\nvengefully tore down in 1992. Uttarakhand, a state under BJP control, has even\nimplemented a civil code that, while quashing Muslims\u2019 access to laws of their\nown, still allows Hindus to access specific tax provisions that result in\nsignificant savings.\n\n### A NEW NATION\n\nToday, the RSS is closer than ever to creating the country of its imagination.\nBut it is not yet sated. As the group approaches its 100th anniversary, it\nwants to render the de facto Hindu nation it has built into one that is de\njure. And if Modi wins a third term, he will do whatever he can to deliver.\n\nModi\u2019s success will depend on the size of his majority. Today, the BJP and its\nallies control 346 of the 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament. They are\njust shy of a majority in the upper house, where they control 122 of the 245\nseats. These seats are elected by provincial legislatures over a six-year\ncycle rather than through a direct vote. But the BJP will almost certainly\nobtain a majority in the upper house by 2025 and is expected to preserve its\nmajority in the lower house. The party will then be able to advance legal\nchanges that have eluded it so far. It may, for example, extend the civil code\nadopted in Uttarakhand across the country.\n\nThe BJP will also build on past provisions. It could, in particular, fully\nimplement the national register of citizens that it announced in 2019. The\nregister, the government claims, will allow it to detain and deport\nundocumented immigrants. In reality, it is a mechanism through which New Delhi\ncan deport Christians and Muslims. To join the registry, Indians must prove\ntheir citizenship by providing certain documents. In a country where good\nrecords can be hard to find, many will fail to get the papers they need. In\nthe prevalent Islamophobic climate, it would then be easy to label Muslims as\nillegal immigrants and threaten to detain and expel them.\n\nTo make other fundamental shifts, the BJP will need to alter the constitution.\nThat will be a much harder task. Constitutional amendments must pass each of\nthe two houses by what is called a \u201cspecial majority,\u201d a vote in which at\nleast two-thirds of the members of each house participate. This means\nopposition parties can block an amendment if they control at least a third of\neither chamber. The BJP and its allies must therefore gain an additional 30\nseats in the lower house and 42 in the upper house if they want to change\nIndia\u2019s foundational text. But if the party can succeed in 2025 and then in\nsubsequent state elections, it will finally be able to scrub the constitution\nof its secular provisions and language.\n\n> Modi\u2019s success will depend on the size of his majority.\n\nThese numbers help explain why the BJP has resorted to controversial methods\ngoing into these elections. To complete its mission, the RSS must stamp out\nany serious opposition\u2014to the point where no party can challenge Hindu\nnationalists in state or federal elections. And to do that, the party has\nemployed even more autocratic and illiberal techniques, including arresting\nopposition leaders such as Kejriwal.\n\nAlthough such acts are controversial, there are reasons to think the BJP will\nnot pay an electoral penalty for them. The mass media is effectively\ncontrolled by the BJP and its affiliates. It has largely prevented details\nabout the government\u2019s misuse of power from reaching ordinary voters, and when\nit does allow news to seep through, the information is typically couched in\ndiscourse about how the opposition has done and will do far worse things.\n\nThe Indian opposition will also struggle to capitalize on any of the BJP\u2019s\nvulnerabilities. The country\u2019s election process is overseen by a body that is\nnow staffed by ex-bureaucrats selected by the government, and their behavior\nduring other recent elections suggests they will ignore the BJP\u2019s dog whistles\nabout Muslims and punish the opposition for even minor infractions. (In the\npast, for example, they have disqualified legislators.) Even without such\npenalties, the opposition will be feeble. Kejriwal is in jail. The de facto\nleader of the Indian National Congress\u2014Rahul Gandhi\u2014has not been imprisoned\n(although convicted of defaming Modi, he remains free on appeal), but he is\nwidely considered ineffective. The scion of a political dynasty, Gandhi has\nworked hard to improve his personal branding, but he has failed to create an\norganization that can take on the BJP. In an effort to stay above the day-to-\nday fray of politics, he has placed other politicians in charge of rebuilding\nthe once dominant party. But as long as he remains involved, they cannot wield\nreal authority. The result is an irresolvable dilemma. India\u2019s biggest\nopposition party is helmed by a leader who does not want to lead, but that can\nonly be led by him.\n\nIn the meantime, the BJP marches on. It seems certain to win in the coming\nelection, so the next five years are all but guaranteed to feature further\nauthoritarianism and increasing marginalization of Muslims. But if the party\nscores big, it may be able to irrevocably restructure the Indian polity. The\nmargins, therefore, matter. The fate of over 1.4 billion people hangs in the\nbalance.\n\nLoading...\n\n### You are reading a free article.\n\n#### Subscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n\n  * Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n  * Unlock access to iOS/Android apps to save editions for offline reading\n  * Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n\nSubscribe Now\n\n  * HARTOSH SINGH BAL is Executive Editor of The Caravan in New Delhi and the author of Waters Close Over Us: A Journey Along the Narmada.\n\n  * More By Hartosh Singh Bal\n\nMore:\n\nIndia Campaigns & Elections Politics & Society Ideology Public Opinion\nNarendra Modi Nationalism\n\n## Most-Read Articles\n\n### The Talks That Could Have Ended the War in Ukraine\n\nA Hidden History of Diplomacy That Came Up Short\u2014but Holds Lessons for Future\nNegotiations\n\n#### Samuel Charap and Sergey Radchenko\n\n### The Case for Progressive Realism\n\nWhy Britain Must Chart a New Global Course\n\n#### David Lammy\n\n### How Israel Can Win in Gaza\u2014and Deter Iran\n\nThe Key to Both Goals Is Going After Hamas in Rafah\n\n#### Elliott Abrams\n\n### No Substitute for Victory\n\nAmerica\u2019s Competition With China Must Be Won, Not Managed\n\n#### Matt Pottinger and Mike Gallagher\n\n### Recommended Articles\n\n### A Hindu Nationalist Foreign Policy\n\nUnder Modi, India Is Becoming More Assertive\n\n#### Rohan Mukherjee\n\n### India\u2019s Feet of Clay\n\nHow Modi\u2019s Supremacy Will Hinder His Country\u2019s Rise\n\n#### Ramachandra Guha\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n#### Save up to 55%\n\n##### on Foreign Affairs!\n\nSubscribe\n\nForeign Affairs\n\n#### Weekly Newsletter\n\n##### Get in-depth analysis delivered right to your inbox\n\nGraduate School Forum\n\nFrom the publishers of Foreign Affairs\n\nBaltimore Bridge Collapse Tests U.S. Supply Chains\n\nZongyuan Zoe Liu\n\nCan Egypt\u2019s Economic Overhaul Stave Off Crisis?\n\nNoah Berman\n\nOnshoring Semiconductor Production: National Security Versus Economic\nEfficiency\n\nAuthor:David Sacks\n\nPublished by the Council on Foreign Relations\n\n\u00a92024 Council on Foreign Relations, Inc.
