I have also developed an obscene interest in computational\ntechniques...\u201d\n\nThis seemingly mundane communication was to foreshadow a decisive effect on\nthe development of two overwhelmingly important aspects of 20th and 21st\ncentury technology \u2013 the development of computing and the development of\nnuclear weapons.\n\nJohnny von Neumann was the multifaceted intellectual diamond of the 20th\ncentury. He contributed so many seminal ideas to so many fields so quickly\nthat it would be impossible for any one person to summarize, let alone\nunderstand them. He may have been the last universalist in mathematics, having\nalmost complete command of both pure and applied mathematics. But he didn\u2019t\nstop there. After making fundamental contributions to operator algebra, set\ntheory and the foundations of mathematics, he revolutionized at least two\ndifferent and disparate fields \u2013 economics and computer science \u2013 and made\ncontributions to a dozen others, each of which would have been important\nenough to enshrine his name in scientific history.\n\nBut at the end of his relatively short life which was cut down cruelly by\ncancer, von Neumann had acquired another identity \u2013 that of an American\npatriot who had done more than almost anyone else to make sure that his\ncountry was well-defended and ahead of the Soviet Union in the rapidly heating\nCold War. Like most other contributions of this sort, this one had a\ndistinctly Faustian gleam to it, bringing both glory and woe to humanity\u2019s\nexperiments in self-elevation and self-destruction.\n\nThe origins of Johnny\u2019s far-reaching accomplishments lay in the Manhattan\nProject. But this fact alone is curious: Von Neumann was never part of the\nregular cast of characters at Los Alamos which included Robert Oppenheimer,\nHans Bethe, Edward Teller, Richard Feynman, Enrico Fermi and other world-\nrenowned scientists; he features as a relatively minor player in most standard\nhistories of the project. He visited as a consultant a few times a year. And\nyet in some sense, his contribution equalled or even exceeded in the long-term\nthe contributions made by his fellow scientists. This discrepancy between his\nrole in the Manhattan Project and the importance of his work speaks to both\nhis awesome intellect and, more interestingly, to a core element in the\nhistory and philosophy of science in which ideas and technologies unexpectedly\nintersect and piggyback on each other. To understand this more fully, it\u2019s\nimportant to understand von Neumann\u2019s origins.\n\nFrom Budapest to Los Alamos via Princeton\n\nJohnny at age 11 with his cousin (Image: Michael Vonneumann and Cantor\u2019s\nParadise)\n\nVon Neumann was the quintessential product of turn-of-the-century Jewish\naffluence and intellectual achievement in the Austro-Hungarian empire. Born in\n1903 to a wealthy banker and his wife in Budapest, Johnny was one of history\u2019s\ngreat child prodigies, speaking half a dozen languages and learning calculus\nby the time he was barely past the first decade of his life. He had an amazing\nphotographic memory and an intense interest in history that stayed with him\nall his life and dazzled his friends and colleagues; as the story goes, by the\ntime he was eight he had read and annotated all forty-three volumes of a\ncomprehensive world history written by the German historian Wilhelm Oncken,\nand he used to stun his parents\u2019 friends by reciting entire pages from the\nphone directory as a child. As he grew up he collected around himself some of\nthe great Hungarian minds of the 20th century \u2013 Eugene Wigner, Leo Szilard,\nEdward Teller. Later all of them became \u00e9migr\u00e9s to the United States, and\ntheir superior intelligence led others to joke that they were Martians who had\nlearnt to perfectly mimic human beings. Toward the end of his life, Eugene\nWigner who won a Nobel Prize for his work on nuclear structure was asked why a\ntiny country like Hungary produced so many scientific geniuses. Wigner said\nthat Hungary had produced only one genius \u2013 Johnny von Neumann.\n\nAfter getting two degrees in Zurich and Budapest, one in mathematics and one\nin chemical engineering \u2013 the latter to to please his father who, like many\nJewish fathers, worried that his son might not be able to get a job in spite\nof his great intellect but due to his Jewish background \u2013 von Neumann became\nan assistant to David Hilbert, one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest\nmathematicians. While his early forays were in set theory and operator\nalgebra, in a short time he left a blazing trail of contributions whose depth\nand breadth would be unequalled in the annals of 20th century mathematics and\nscience. By his 30th birthday, he had solved Hilbert\u2019s fifth problem for\ncompact groups, proved the mean ergodic theorem, provided a mathematical\nfoundation for quantum mechanics, proved the minimax theorem, started laying\nthe foundation for game theory in economics and done important work in the\nfoundations of mathematics.\n\nHe had already become acutely prescient about the deteriorating political\nsituation in Europe. After Hitler became chancellor of Germany in 1933, Johnny\nstarted making trips to the United States where he had been invited to lecture\nat the Institute for Advanced Study. The institute had been set up as a kind\nof pure thinkers\u2019 heaven by the renowned educator Abraham Flexner, and there\nwere few fields more suited to pure thought than mathematics, philosophy and\ntheoretical physics. Flexner went to great lengths to snag the greatest fish\nof them all \u2013 Albert Einstein. By 1933 Einstein had already been the target of\nvirulent anti-Semitic attacks and was looking for a new home. After visiting a\nfew universities in the United States and England, Flexner lured him to\nPrinceton with the promise of a very generous salary and complete freedom to\nexplore his interests without any administrative or teaching responsibilities.\nBut even by 1933, when Einstein was fifty-four, the twenty-nine-year-old von\nNeumann was considered important enough to be made one of the first professors\nat the institute, along with Einstein, Hermann Weyl and Oswald Veblen, a\nmathematician who was as adept at hacking away at the brush in the Princeton\nwoods as he was at problems in geometry and topology. Veblen was to become an\nimportant mentor to Johnny. When the institute\u2019s plans to hire Weyl fell\nthrough, Johnny was hired as a permanent faculty member.\n\nEver since he moved to the United States, Johnny showed a great love for his\nadopted country. His home was the scene of weekly raucous parties, and he\nloved fast cars, expensive suits and hobnobbing with the rich and famous. His\nfriend Eugene Wigner who had shipped from Hungary as a joint appointment with\nvon Neumann recalled how Johnny was refreshed by the new world and by the\nyouthful enthusiasm he saw there which rejected the reactionary and orthodox\nideas of old world Europe, a motivation not uncommon among American \u00e9migr\u00e9s.\nAs Europe crumbled in the face of fascism in the next few years, Johnny was\njoined by European scientists like Bethe, Fermi and Weisskopf who became\nhousehold names, started great schools of science and catapulted America into\nthe front ranks of science and technology, a position that it continues to\nhold in no small part due to such immigrants.\n\nOskar Morgenstern and von Neumann published \u201cTheory of Games and Economic\nBehavior\u201d in 1944, when Johnny was already deep into defense work (Image:\nThatsMaths)\n\nBecause of his intense interest and background in history, Johnny could\nalready see in 1935 that there would be some kind of war between Germany and\nother countries. By 1937 he had started expressing interest in the more\napplied parts of mathematics. His work on the minimax theorem and the\nfoundations of quantum mechanics was already dazzling, especially for a pure\nmathematician, and in Princeton he had struck up a friendship with another\nAustrian emigre, the economist Oskar Morgenstern. During the next few years he\nwould embark on the writing \u201cThe Theory of Games and Economic Behavior\u201d with\nMorgenstern which is now considered the foundation of game theory.\n\nWhat accounted for Johnny\u2019s forays into applied mathematics and away from pure\nmathematics? One reason was certainly his capacious mind that roamed over\ndiverse domains out of sheer burning intellectual curiosity, but I also\npersonally feel that it was partly a disillusionment with the foundations of\nmathematics, a disillusionment that was made acutely clear by the work of his\nfriend and institute colleague Kurt G\u00f6del who in 1932 had struck a blow at the\nfoundations of mathematics through his famous incompleteness theorems. Johnny\nhad extended G\u00f6del\u2019s first theorem in short order, only to find that G\u00f6del had\nalready gotten there. Later he did what he could to ensure G\u00f6del\u2019s appointment\nat the institute; the two friends now lie only a few feet from each other.\nG\u00f6del\u2019s work might have convinced Johnny that making deep contributions to\npure mathematics was perhaps not his forte. Fortunately for him, the\nescalating situation in Europe brought a new opportunity that would make full\nuse of his intellectual powers.\n\nShaped charges and the Aberdeen Proving Ground\n\nCharles Munroe (Image: Wikipedia)\n\nIn 1888, an American chemist working for the navy named Charles Munroe\ndiscovered something quite wonderful and intriguing. Monroe found that when he\ndetonated a block of explosive with the company\u2019s name engraved on it with\nraised letters near a metal plate, the raised letters somehow got\n\u201ctransferred\u201d into the metal plate. What was happening was that the explosive\nblast from the block took the shape of the letters \u2013 and stayed that way for\nsome time. Later Munroe demonstrated this effect even more convincingly with a\nmetal safe. As he described it in a 1900 \u2018Popular Science\u2019 article,\n\n\u201cAmong the experiments made ... was one upon a safe twenty-nine inches cube,\nwith walls four inches and three quarters thick, made up of plates of iron and\nsteel ... When a hollow charge of dynamite nine pounds and a half in weight\nand untamped was detonated on it, a hole three inches in diameter was blown\nclear through the wall ... The hollow cartridge was made by tying the sticks\nof dynamite around a tin can, the open mouth of the latter being placed\ndownward.\u201d\n\nThus was born the principle of the Munroe Effect and the shaped charge, a\nphenomenon which still has a little bit of a whiff of magic to it. The shaped\ncharge essentially enables a precisely geometrically-shaped explosive to\nephemerally create a small pocket of air that is packed with deadly force \u2013\nhell in a puff of air. When this puff hits a target, even a metal safe cannot\nhelp but be cast in its shadow. Shaped charges soon started seeing use in many\npeaceful applications of explosives to create controlled, precisely shaped,\npowerful cavities in materials like rocks and metals. By the time the 1930s\ncame along, scientists in many countries had gotten interested in them. A\nparticularly important contribution was made by R. W. Wood, a Johns Hopkins\nphysicist whose initial interest stemmed from morbid accidental deaths by\nshaped charges.\n\nAn illuminating history of shaped charges tells the story of how the\ntechnology gradually percolated from America to Britain and back to America.\nBut there was an ominous detour in Germany. An Austrian physicist named Rudolf\nThomanek had become interested in the British and American work and was trying\nto develop an anti-tank gun. By 1932, he had become convinced that the\nAustrian authorities were \u201chalfwits\u201d who were uninterested \u2013 why not try to\nsell the concept to the much more enthusiastic German authorities? In fact,\nwhy not go straight to the top? By the end of 1935, Thomanek had pulled enough\nstrings to find himself presenting the idea to an audience consisting of\nHitler, Himmler, Goering and the General Staff of the Third Reich\u2019s armed\nforces. Contrary to his later, well-deserved image as a strategist who\nroutinely came up with unworkable and outlandish schemes, Hitler was extremely\ndetail-oriented and well-versed when it came to weaponry. Thomanek had put a\ndented plate on Hitler\u2019s desk.\n\nThe German version of the American bazooka \u2013 the \u2018Panzerfaust\u2019 (Image:\nHistoryNet)\n\n\u201cI am in a hurry and will express my opinion immediately\u201d, Hitler said. \u201cThis\nproposal could be the solution I have always wanted to give the individual\nsoldier a weapon to defeat tanks. Maybe the same principle could be used in\nbombs and torpedoes.\u201d\n\nThe F\u00fchrer had grasped the significance of the new idea immediately. So did\nscientists, engineers and politicians in Britain, the Soviet Union and the\nUnited States. In the United States the shaped charge saw incarnation as the\nfabled anti-tank weapon the Bazooka, a weapon whose detailed workings were\nkept secret until 1945 when the core principle was revealed by a reprint of\nMunroe\u2019s 1900 Popular Science article. The point of this slight digression is\nto indicate that by 1937, shaped charges were a well-studied form of anti-tank\nweaponry. They were also ideally suited to von Neumann\u2019s particular skill set,\nand it was at the Aberdeen Proving Ground that they found fertile landfall.\n\nThe Aberdeen Proving ground in Maryland had been set up during World War 1 for\nballistics research. Ballistics research was a clear priority for any army\nutilizing artillery. The main area of research for ballistics specialists was\nfiring tables that indicated the velocity and the angle at which to fire a\nprojectile to hit both stationary and moving targets. In 1918, Oswald Veblen\nhad been hired to oversee scientific work at the site, and among others had\nrecruited von Neumann\u2019s fellow mathematical prodigy Norbert Wiener to work\nwith him. By the late 1930s, Aberdeen was in a good position to contribute to\nthe war effort and Veblen invited von Neumann to join him. The newly\nnaturalized Johnny was eager enough that he applied to take an exam as a\nlieutenant in the army reserve in 1939. Amusingly, even though he passed the\nexam, he was turned down because of an age cutoff. Senator William Smathers\nfrom New Jersey expressed his perplexed reaction to FDR\u2019s Secretary of War,\nHarry Woodring: \u201cMr. von Neumann is internationally known as a mathematician,\nand I cannot understand how a man with so much potential value to the American\narmed forces should be turned down for a technicality.\u201d\n\nThe reason Smathers and Veblen considered Johnny so valuable to a potential\nwar effort was simple. Although von Neumann had no training in war-related\nwork, his singular skill as a universalist mathematician would be invaluable\nin analyzing the nonlinear phenomena involved in shaped charge detonation.\nCrudely speaking, nonlinear phenomena deal with cases in which a given\nstimulus produces a disproportionate response. Most complex phenomena in the\nreal world of interest to scientists are nonlinear, and in that sense the name\n\u2018nonlinear\u2019 is a misnomer: As von Neumann\u2019s best friend Stanislaw Ulam who had\nescaped Poland before the Nazis invaded it once said, \u201cUsing a term like\nnonlinear science is like referring to the bulk of zoology as the study of\nnon-elephant animals.\u201d Nonlinear phenomena required mathematical manipulation\nat the highest level because of the complexity of the equations which usually\ninvolved partial differential equations in multiple dimensions. Both the\nversatility and speed of von Neumann\u2019s mind made him an ideal candidate for\nanalyzing these. As we will see later, Johnny\u2019s interest in nonlinear\nequations was to have an unexpected and revolutionary impact on modern\ntechnology.\n\nAs the United States entered World War 2 after Pearl Harbor, most European\n\u00e9migr\u00e9 scientists wanted to do their part to help the war effort. Johnny\u2019s\npoint of departure into what became his most important contribution arose from\nHans Bethe and Edward Teller\u2019s work on shock waves. In 1941, Teller and Bethe\nhad analyzed how the change in conditions around a shock wave, both in its\nfront and back, can be analyzed in terms of characteristics like the medium\u2019s\ntemperature, pressure etc. To a simplifying approximation, Teller and Bethe\nfound that the conditions at the front of the developing wave can be\nrepresented accurately by knowing the conditions at the back of the wave.\nJohnny was aware of this work, and in May 1941 wrote a letter to Bethe in\nwhich he asked the physicist if he and Teller could extend their work to air\nat 25,000 degrees centigrade. The scientists were finding out, interestingly,\nthat the so-called equations of state for materials that relate pressure,\ntemperature and density to each other were actually simplified at higher\ntemperatures compared to lower ones because of a kind of equalizing behavior\nof different materials at those temperatures. Johnny\u2019s main contribution had\nbeen to figure out that the behavior of the detonation of a shaped charge\ncould be interpreted as the propagation of a shock wave followed by chemical\nreaction of the materials in the medium. We thus know that even before Pearl\nHarbor, Johnny was already making himself an expert in the behavior of shock\nwaves at high temperatures.\n\nFrom shaped charges to implosion\n\nCuriously, von Neumann wasn\u2019t involved in the early developments leading to\nthe Manhattan Project, perhaps he already had much on his plate at that point.\nNot only was he consulting for multiple departments of the army and navy, but\nhe was also making trips to England as a consultant. The early steps leading\nto the bomb project were all taken by physicists like Leo Szilard, Edward\nTeller, Robert Oppenheimer and Enrico Fermi. After the news of fission came to\nthe United States in 1939, Szilard convinced his friend Einstein to write a\nfamous letter to FDR impressing on him the urgency of starting research into\nuranium fission. By the summer of 1942, Oppenheimer had been picked by Leslie\nGroves, the head of the project, to oversee a preliminary theoretical effort\ninto a fission bomb. At Berkeley that summer, Oppenheimer, Bethe, Teller and\nothers convinced themselves that theoretically, a simple fission bomb would be\npossible. By the end of 1942, Enrico Fermi and his team had done a proof-of-\nconcept experiment and built the world\u2019s first nuclear reactor at the\nUniversity of Chicago. With Fermi\u2019s experiments the Manhattan Project kicked\ninto high gear, and by March 1943 an isolated site set among the majestic\nmesas of Los Alamos in New Mexico had been selected for the top-secret\nproject.\n\nAs has been well documented, the basic principle of building a fission bomb\nwas clear by 1943. You had to fire two subcritical pieces of uranium into one\nanother, and once the critical mass had been exceeded there would be an\nexplosion. It was also understood that this process needed to be exceptionally\nfast to prevent pre-detonation or a fizzle which would give suboptimal yield.\nThe main challenge was always considered the separation of uranium isotopes\nand the production of plutonium, a novel material which would be even more\nfissile. By the time the scientists settled in at Los Alamos, Oppenheimer\u2019s\nclose collaborator and confidant Robert Serber had given a set of lectures\nsummarizing the state of knowledge.\n\nIt was then that a physicist named Seth Neddermeyer came up with an entirely\nnovel approach to detonating a bomb \u2013 an approach called implosion. Instead of\ncrashing two pieces of fissile material together, implosion called for\nbringing together those pieces inward, preferably in three dimensions to\nmaximize efficiency. It says something about how novel and speculative this\napproach was that Neddermeyer\u2019s idea met with fierce opposition from the likes\nof scientists like Bethe, Fermi and Feynman, men who weren\u2019t known for a\ndeficiency of new ideas. Deke Parsons, a naval physicist who was called in to\nhelp with ordnance, derisively called it the \u201cbeer can experiment\u201d: the\nchallenge was to symmetrically implode or squeeze a beer can from all sides\nwithout having the beer squirt out. But Oppenheimer was more prescient and he\nasked Neddermeyer to conduct preliminary experiments. Stymied by complex three\ndimensions, Neddermeyer started working with cylinders in two dimensions. By\nSeptember 1943, the work was trudging along and Neddermeyer was not a\nparticularly harmonious individual to work with, sticking to his ideas and\nseldom entertaining others. More importantly, what had been already suspected\nby Oppenheimer\u2019s team in 1942 now became clear \u2013 that when it came to building\na bomb, understanding the hydrodynamics or flow of shock waves was as\nimportant as understanding the nuclear physics and flow of radiation and\nparticles like neutrons. Enter Johnny von Neumann.\n\nOppenheimer had written a letter to von Neumann in July 1943, and the contents\nof that letter make clear both the high regard in which he held Johnny and the\ndifficulties he was facing:\n\n\u201cWe are in what can only be described as a desperate need of your help. We\nhave a good many theoretical people working here, but I think that if your\nusual shrewdness is a guide to you about the probable nature of our problems\nyou will see why even this staff is in some respects critically inadequate...I\nwould like you to come as a permanent, and let me assure you, honored member\nof our staff. A visit will give you a better idea of this somewhat Buck Rogers\nproject than any amount of correspondence.\u201d\n\nAt this point it\u2019s worth noting von Neumann\u2019s salient qualities that were\nconsidered to be helpful in such a project. I have noted these qualities in\ndetail before in an essay about his major contributions to computing. In a\nnutshell, while Johnny\u2019s mind was as original as anyone else\u2019s, his main\nstrength was being able to jump ten steps ahead of everyone with his lightning\nfast mind, look at the big picture and connect disparate ideas together. This\nenabled him, in his friend Edward Teller\u2019s words, \u201cto identify solutions where\nmost people didn\u2019t even notice the problems.\u201d All this not only made von\nNeumann a supremely reliable mind to seek advice from but lent his words\nenormous prestige. Johnny agreed to visit Los Alamos, not as a permanent\nmember but as a consultant in September 1943. When not at Los Alamos, he would\nwork out of the office of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat Johnny essentially did in his critical visit was anoint implosion with\nhis blessings. He confirmed that the best way to achieve implosion would be to\nspherically place shaped charges around a uranium or plutonium core; the\nMunroe Effect operating in three dimensions would then squeeze the core to the\nunearthly densities required to bring about the fission reaction. He also made\nthe critical suggestion that implosion could be made much faster by increasing\nthe ratio of the explosive in the shaped charges to the nuclear material. The\nfaster assembly would not only prevent pre-detonation or a fizzle by making\nsure that the material has already reached critical mass before the nuclear\nfission reaction has been initiated, but the higher explosive to fissile\nmaterial ratio would mean that you would need to use less of exceedingly\nprecious enriched uranium or plutonium. In fact, as Johnny discovered because\nof his friend Teller who was very knowledgeable about the behavior of\nmaterials at high pressure, at the pressures that would exist in the core,\nmaterials would get squeezed so hard that they would become not just critical\nbut supercritical, greatly accelerating the efficiency of the resulting\nexplosion.\n\nBecause of his prestige and confidence in his calculations, von Neumann\nbreathed fresh air into what was until then a creaky, uncertain program that\nNeddermeyer had been stubbornly sticking to. Fermi, Bethe and other senior\nscientists who had until then been skeptical of Neddermeyer\u2019s scheme not only\ntrusted von Neumann but regarded his dazzling mind with an awe that would be\nextraordinary for men who themselves were some of the leading scientific minds\nof the 20th century. Perhaps the ultimate tribute to von Neumann\u2019s\nintelligence was paid by Bethe when he remarked after the war that \u201cVon\nNeumann\u2019s mind seemed to indicate that he belonged to a new species, an\nevolution beyond man.\u201d, and Fermi once told his student Richard Garwin that\nvon Neumann left him feeling he knew no mathematics at all. After von\nNeumann\u2019s trip Charles Critchfield, a theoretical physicist on Oppenheimer\u2019s\nteam, said, \u201cJohnny woke everyone up. He was a very resourceful person, at\nleast twenty years ahead of his time.\u201d\n\nOnce von Neumann made his suggestions, it was quite clear that the implosion\nprogram had to be given top priority. There were two main challenges\nassociated with implementing it. One was to work out the complicated nonlinear\nhydrodynamical equations associated with the shock wave. The other was to find\nexplosive materials which would sustain an imploding wave and have it impinge\non the center of the fission target uniformly. To aid with the latter task,\nOppenheimer invited George Kistiakowsky from Harvard who was a world-class\nexpert in explosives; in his spare time Kistiakowsky would use his explosives\nknowledge to raze trees and create ski slopes on the mesa for recreation for\nthe scientists. He also set aside separate groups that would develop the\ndiagnostics and assembly techniques for implosion, including the development\nof novel detonators that would assure an instantaneous detonation on multiple\npoints of a sphere. None of these innovations or work was trivial, but von\nNeumann left everyone with the feeling that it was possible.\n\nThe biggest challenge in putting implosion into practice was to design an\nassembly of explosives that would ensure a symmetric shock wave \u2013 an asymmetry\nas little as 5% would lead to a \u201cbeer can experiment\u201d. The problem with a\nstandard explosion is that it sets off a diverging shock wave. To ensure that\nthis wave impinged on the uranium or plutonium at the center, it had to\nsomehow be turned from diverging to converging. How to achieve this? At this\npoint another valuable character showed up, from England. James Tuck was part\nof the British contingent to Los Alamos, a small cadre of highly accomplished\nphysicists who were to help with the bomb. The proof-of-concept for fission\nand critical mass had actually been worked out in England before the United\nStates, so it was natural for British scientists to be involved. Tuck had\nexperience working with explosive materials of differing densities. College\nphysics says that when a light wave passes through materials of varying\ndensities, it bends or refracts differently. Similarly a shock wave would\n\u201crefract\u201d or bend differently with different densities. And just like a\nmaterial that refracts and transmits light is a lens, so an explosive that\nbends and transmits shock waves is an \u201cexplosive lens\u201d. Tuck suggested an\ningenious arrangement in which a diverging shock wave could be turned into a\nconverging one by layering explosives burning at different rates together. By\nstarting the detonation in fast-burning explosive and then maneuvering the\nresulting wave inside using shaped charges of slow-burning explosives, thirty-\ntwo different waves from thirty-two different points of detonation could be\nmade to converge to a pinpoint at the center, squeezing the material to\nunearthly densities and triggering the fission reaction. It was again von\nNeumann who worked out the mathematics of explosive lenses and played a major\nrole in their design.\n\nAn explosive lens in an implosion weapon (Image: Wikipedia)\n\nThe real role played by von Neumann, Tuck, Kistiakowsky and others became\napparent when a critical observation made it clear that implosion would be the\nonly possible way to assemble the plutonium weapon. In the fall of 1944,\nEmilio Segr\u00e8, a protege of Fermi\u2019s, discovered that the plutonium-239 being\nused in the bomb contained an isotope, plutonium-240, that was an inevitable\nbyproduct of the reactor-bred plutonium in the reactors at Hanford, Washington\nstate. Pu-240 underwent spontaneous fission without any initiation, and it\nturned out that the gun method that was being used for the uranium bomb would\nbe too slow to prevent pre-detonation or a fizzle. Implosion would be the only\npossible way to go for plutonium. Without implosion the plutonium bomb would\nlikely have been abandoned at this stage. Implosion was still considered such\na novel concept that the design was tested in New Mexico\u2019s Alamogordo desert\non July 16, 1945.\n\nVon Neumann wasn\u2019t done with his ideas though. A crucial albeit rather dark\ncontribution that he made was to simplify the calculations used to estimate\nthe pressures from a bomb. Von Neumann knew that for large explosions, the\neffects of the detonation are not dictated by the length of the pulse but only\nby the excess pressure that results; this made the relationship between bomb\nyield and effects a much simpler one. More importantly, using his knowledge of\nshock wave reflections, Johnny helped to estimate the optimal height at which\na nuclear bomb should be exploded to cause maximum damage. On August 6, 1945,\nthe Little Boy uranium bomb exploded at a height of about 1900 feet on top of\nHiroshima. About 80,000 to 100,000 people were instantly killed, providing a\nreal-life demonstration of von Neumann\u2019s calculations.\n\nVon Neumann, Feynman and Ulam at Los Alamos: Their individual attire seems\nconsonant with their personalities (Image: Atomic Heritage)\n\nJohnny enjoyed being at Los Alamos. He reconnected with his old friend Edward\nTeller and invited a new friend, Stan Ulam, to help with the hydrodynamics\ncalculations. Ulam was almost as versatile a mathematician as Johnny and the\ntwo were best friends \u2013 significant parts of Ulam\u2019s wonderful memoir,\n\u201cAdventures of a Mathematician\u201d, are dedicated to describing conversations and\ntravels with Johnny. They tried to recreate the famous cafe atmosphere in\nEastern Europe that had fueled late night mathematical bull sessions in the\nearly 20th century before it all came crashing down. In keeping with his\npredilection for wearing expensive, tailored three-piece suits, Johnny once\nwore one even when riding a mule in the Jemez mountains near the lab. He also\nwent for walks with Richard Feynman, and in his own memoir \u201cSurely You\u2019re\nJoking Mr. Feynman\u201d, Feynman points out that it was von Neumann who planted\nthe idea in his mind that knowing how uncertain the consequences of our\nactions are, you should not have them weigh too heavily on your conscience.\nKnowing the rather grim endeavor that the physicists were involved with, this\nwas psychologically soothing advice for Feynman.\n\n\u201cI am thinking about something much more important than bombs; I am thinking\nabout computers.\u201d\n\nFor all his critical ideas, the most important and far-reaching thing to come\nout of von Neumann\u2019s work at Los Alamos had little to do with bombs. Once\nJohnny suggested using spherical implosion, it quickly became clear that the\ncalculations involved would be too complex for individuals to perform. In\nEngland and before, Johnny had already been introduced to early computing\nmachines, and he had been impressed with Alan Turing\u2019s seminal paper on Turing\nmachines and even tried to recruit Turing as his assistant when Turing visited\nPrinceton to finish his PhD before the war. Now when it became clear that\ncomputing machines might be needed to handle the complex physics of implosion,\nJohnny was again in the right place at the right time. Stan Ulam who came to\nLos Alamos on Johnny\u2019s invitation captured the problem well: \u201cThe\nhydrodynamical problem was simply stated but very difficult to calculate, not\njust in its details but even in order of magnitude.\u201d He remembered a\ndiscussion in which von Neumann and others had suggested all kinds of\ningenious shortcuts and theoretical simplifications, and he wondered whether\n\u201cmore simpleminded brute force, that is, more realistic, numerical work\u201d might\nnot be better.\n\nTo do this kind of work, the first IBM computing machines arrived in April,\n1944 to help with the calculations. The implosion problem involved the\nintegration of a hyperbolic partial differential equation in one space and one\ntime coordinate. The integration was carried out using punched cards; Richard\nFeynman was in charge of this effort. Johnny himself spent two weeks\nprogramming the machines and getting a feel for the calculations. He found\nrewiring the tabulators especially cumbersome, and this frustration had an\nimpact on his later crucial thinking about general-purpose computers. Johnny\nalso knew that Howard Aiken at Harvard had had IBM build one of the first\nprogrammable computers, and he arranged for a numerical integration of a\nsecond-order partial differential equation to be run simultaneously on the Los\nAlamos computer and the Harvard computer as a contest; the Los Alamos computer\nfinished first, but the Harvard computer calculated to more decimal places.\n\nHis experience at Los Alamos immediately suggested to the thinking-ten-steps-\nahead Johnny that computers were going to become an invaluable asset in doing\ncomplex math and science. Quite fortuitously, around the same time he also\ncame in contact with the pioneering engineers Presper Eckert and John Mauchly\nwho were building one of the first pioneering general-purpose computers, the\nENIAC, at the University of Pennsylvania. I have described Johnny\u2019s accidental\nintroduction to computers and his subsequent work as one of the fathers of\nmodern computing in a separate essay, but it is clear that it was his work at\nLos Alamos that crystallized in his mind the value of computers as an enabling\ntool for science and technology. It was characteristically far-sighted of him\nthat even before the war ended he was writing to a colleague, \u201cI am thinking\nabout something much more important than bombs; I am thinking about\ncomputers.\u201d\n\nJohnny\u2019s legacy\n\nJohnny von Neumann\u2019s work at Los Alamos had a direct impact on the weapons of\nmass destruction that leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki and that still decorate\nthe world\u2019s nuclear arsenals. Implosion is still the predominant technique\nused in fission bombs, and even in thermonuclear weapons it\u2019s used as the\nprimary fission device that ignites the fusion secondary. After the war Johnny\nkept on advising the United States government as a high-level consultant; at\none point he advised every agency except the Coast Guard. He made valuable\ncontributions not just to fission weapons but to the thermonuclear weapons\nthat are today capable of killing hundreds of millions in a matter of minutes.\nJust before his death, he became one of the prime movers behind the\nrecommendation to accelerate the United States\u2019s nuclear ICBM program, a\ndevelopment that immediately made the entire world vulnerable to the threat of\nnuclear armageddon. He was convinced that the Soviet Union posed an\nexistential danger to the security of the United States and advocated not just\na preemptive but a preventive strike on that country; thankfully that part of\nhis advice was not taken.\n\nVon Neumann receiving the Medal of Freedom from President Eisenhower (Image:\nUniversity of Texas)\n\nHe remained a steadfast patriot, often politically at odds with his more\nliberal colleagues but always friends with everyone, and was held in such\nesteem that during the last year of his life when cancer unexpectedly struck\nhim, he received the Medal of Freedom from President Eisenhower and spent his\nlast days in a special, guarded suite at Walter Reed Hospital that Eisenhower\nhad specially requisitioned for him. On his deathbed lay a manuscript of a set\nof lectures comparing the computer with the brain. In it lay ideas whose seeds\ngerminated at Los Alamos and whose branches now extend into artificial\nintelligence, robotics and neuroscience. Perhaps his most enduring idea in\nthis regard, and one which is very much still waiting to play out, was the\nidea of self-reproducing automata which could be sent out into space and would\npopulate the cosmos with a diversity of exploding life.\n\nVon Neumann and Oppenheimer in front of the Institute for Advanced Study\ncomputer in Princeton (Image: IAS)\n\nAs the eminent historian of science George Dyson put it in his superb book\n\u201cTuring\u2019s Cathedral\u201d, \u201cBombs made computers, and computers made bombs.\u201d If\ndesigning the implosion lens for nuclear weapons were to be Johnny\u2019s biggest\nlegacy from Los Alamos, it would be a morally dubious one. But his unexpected\nrecognition of the value of computers takes his contributions to a completely\nnew level. While initially he did encourage using computers to simulate the\nworkings of first fission and then fusion weapons, he made seminal\ncontributions to charting out the stored-program concept, random access memory\nand what is today called the von Neumann architecture. With a talented team of\nengineers he designed a pioneering computer at the Institute for Advanced\nStudy. Using this computer, his team made forays into a remarkable number of\nimportant and fascinating topics: weather simulation, artificial life,\nfundamental mathematical research, geophysics. The branches that these\nexplorations sent out continue to thrive.\n\nJohnny von Neumann\u2019s Los Alamos story shows us that often, the most important\nimpact of a new technology is another new technology. Often this new\ntechnology is wholly unanticipated. When Johnny came to Los Alamos, he and his\ncolleagues thought they would be designing bombs, but what they didn\u2019t know\nwas that they would need computers to design those bombs. And that the\ncomputers would be far more important than the bombs even in the short term.\nUltimately a hundred or a thousand years from now, if humanity still survives\nand the world\u2019s nuclear arsenals are a dim memory in a history textbook, we\nwill still be using computers, and computers will still be using us.\n\nRecommended further reading:\n\n  1.
