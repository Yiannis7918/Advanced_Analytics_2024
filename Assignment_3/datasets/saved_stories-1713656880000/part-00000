It involves reading an entire book in your target\nlanguage in a day, or even a sitting, while simultaneously listening to the\naudiobook. Since March 13, I've \"blitzed\" 58 Polish books in 58 straight days,\naiming to reach 100 in 100 days.\n\nDuring my recent Bimodal Blitz sessions, I experienced a cool breakthrough in\nmy language acquisition \u201cblitzathon\u201d. There were passages where I seemed to be\nthinking and reading in Polish, without consciously translating the words into\nEnglish, my native language. I was likely in a cognitive flow state, immersed\nin the language and visualizing what I was blitzing.\n\nFlow State and Language Automaticity\n\nI believe that experiencing cognitive flow is key to developing language\nautomaticity. When in flow, the brain is fully engaged and focused, allowing\nfor more efficient language processing and absorption. This heightened state\nof concentration enables the brain to recognize patterns, grammar structures,\nand vocabulary more quickly and effortlessly, leading to a more natural\nunderstanding of the language.\n\nBreaking the Translation Barrier\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of this breakthrough was accessing the\nmeaning of words and phrases directly in Polish, without conscious\ntranslation. This phenomenon, known as \"breaking the translation barrier\" or\n\"thinking without translating,\" is a gradual process that varies from person\nto person. For me, it happened in flashes \u2014brief moments of what I believe to\nbe direct understanding, although I rarely stop to verify because I\u2019m immersed\nin the book. So, take from this what you will.\n\nRewiring the Brain for Polish\n\nAs I continue to immerse myself in Polish using the Bimodal Blitz method, I\nshould expect my brain to continue reorganizing its neural connections to\naccommodate this new language, making language processing more efficient and\nautomatic over time. My noggin will develop an intuition for Polish, allowing\nme to pick up on patterns, nuances, and meanings without consciously\ntranslating. I see hints of this now. This intuition results from the\nimmersive (and somewhat intense) nature of the Bimodal Blitz experience, which\nlights up the language processing areas in the brain.\n\nMilestones and The Miles Ahead\n\nWhile these experiences of language automaticity and flow state are big\nmilestones for me, there\u2019s still so much to learn. I\u2019ll continue to \u201cblitz\u201d\naway, as the Bimodal Blitz has proven to be an effective tool for rapidly\ninputting the Polish language. I look forward to more moments of direct\nunderstanding and thinking in Polish as I grind on towards blitzing 100 books\nin as many days.\n\nIn closing, the Bimodal Blitz method has been a game-changer in my language\nlearning experience, with the recent breakthroughs in language automaticity\nbeing a sign that I'm going in the right direction. Feel free to experiment\nwith this method and experience the blitz for yourself!\n\nP.S.
