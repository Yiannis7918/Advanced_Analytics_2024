Garc\u00eda\n\n04/10/2024\n\nin Mobility\n\n### The strangest engine in history: from World War II, but with a fuel we\njust discovered\n\n### The new diesel for the engines of the future: the end of gasoline in the\nUnited States\n\n### The catastrophe they fear in the U.S.: automakers suffer an unexpected\nconsequence\n\nDo you know what they\u2019ve discovered? This is the proton engine that Einstein\npredicted decades ago and that, for the first time, they\u2019ve managed to\nmaterialize. The best part? It challenges even the laws of physics and the\nuniverse, and it\u2019s going to decarbonize transportation.\n\n## Einstein predicted a nuclear fusion engine: now they\u2019ve just created it\n\nNuclear fusion has long been a sought-after but elusive goal for science. It\ninvolves joining atomic nuclei to release energy, the same process that occurs\nin the Sun and other stars. In fact, it\u2019s a process similar to what we saw two\nweeks ago with the plasma engine.\n\nUnlike nuclear fission used in current nuclear power plants\u2014which, remember,\nwe are highly critical of due to its lack of being an eco-friendly or\nrenewable option\u2014fusion offers the promise of a virtually inexhaustible and\nclean energy source.\n\nAs early as 1929, Albert Einstein had theorized about the possibility of\ncreating a \u201cproton engine\u201d based on nuclear fusion, which could propel\nspacecraft at speeds close to the speed of light. The idea was to use the high\nfusion temperatures to expel a stream of protons and generate thrust.\n\n## Technology has advanced since then: a tireless evolution\n\nPrevious attempts to create a nuclear fusion engine failed due to\ntechnological limitations. However, in recent decades, there have been\nsignificant advances in several areas that now make it possible to attempt to\nbuild this revolutionary engine.\n\nOne of the main advances has been in new materials capable of withstanding the\nincredibly high temperatures inside a nuclear fusion reactor. Special alloys\nand advanced ceramics have been developed to contain the super-hot plasma\nnecessary for fusion.\n\nAnother key factor is progress in understanding plasma physics and nuclear\nfusion. Scientists now have much more precise computational models to simulate\nand control fusion reactions. This gives them greater capacity to stabilize\nand sustain the necessary reactions.\n\nFurthermore, new techniques for magnetic confinement and electric fields have\nbeen achieved to contain the hot plasma. This prevents the plasma from\ntouching the walls of the reactor, which would cool it down and stop the\nreaction. The new superconducting magnets are key to this.\n\n## The first proton engine, ready to decarbonize transportation (also on\nEarth)\n\nRocketStar is a startup founded in 2021 that is developing a nuclear fusion\npropulsion engine. Their goal is to create a revolutionary rocket engine that\nuses the fusion of hydrogen nuclei to generate extremely high specific\nimpulse.\n\nRocketStar\u2019s design is based on proton fusion (hydrogen nuclei) through a\nfunnel-shaped magnetic field. The protons are injected into the wide end of\nthe funnel and then compressed as they approach the narrow end, reaching\nextremely high temperatures and densities.\n\nFusion releases large amounts of energy that is converted into a plasma jet\ndirected outward at high speed. This provides thrust to the rocket without the\nneed for chemical propellants. The advantage is that fusion fuel (hydrogen) is\nvirtually inexhaustible, and in the long term, it could be used in vehicles.\n\nAs you can see, this proton engine demonstrates that when it comes to making\ntransportation sustainable, physics and mobility can come together. They also\ndid it with this trick to double the range of electric cars, something that\nnow puzzles factories for one simple reason: it\u2019s too good to be true, but\nthousands of drivers are already experiencing how well it works.\n\n\u00a9 2024 by ECOticias\n\n  * Economy\n  * Energy\n  * Environment\n  * Mobility\n  * Technology\n  * Trending\n\nNo Result\n\nView All Result\n\n  * Economy\n  * Mobility\n  * Energy\n  * Technology\n  * Environment\n  * Trending\n  * ECOticias\n\n\u00a9 2024 by ECOticias\n\n", "frontpage": false}
