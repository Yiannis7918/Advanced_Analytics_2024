(Saori Kuroda)\n\nJapanese courts continue to reject arbitrators of foreign nationalities,\nalthough there is no official nationality requirement for the job and demand\nhas soared for their services.\n\nSuch shunning has put many non-Japanese people at a disadvantage in legal\nmatters concerning divorce, child custody, inheritance and other daily\naffairs.\n\nBar associations and other relevant organizations choose arbitrator candidates\nfrom among lawyers and experts in legal matters and other subjects.\n\nCourts then send the nominations to the Supreme Court, which screens the\ncandidates and possibly anoints them.\n\nBut with rejections of foreign arbitrators rife, some of those chosen may be\nunfamiliar with the problems facing foreign residents and may not even speak\ntheir language.\n\nThe nongovernmental group Network for Foreigners\u2019 Assistance Kobe has been\nflooded with inquiries from non-Japanese people about legal matters.\n\nOne domestic violence victim wanted to get a divorce but was worried that the\nseparation could affect visa status.\n\nAnother asked about child custody following a divorce.\n\nMany of the information seekers are from the Philippines, China and Brazil and\nare married to Japanese citizens.\n\nThe organization held phone consultations with 500 individuals last fiscal\nyear, and its officials accompanied people on 400 occasions to help them\nresolve their legal difficulties.\n\n\u201cMy impression is that more than half of them were dealing with issues\nconcerning divorces,\u201d said Yuki Muranishi, 35, a member of the group\u2019s\nsecretariat.\n\nAccording to the 2020 national census, 650,000 couples in international\nmarriages were living in Japan, or 2 percent of the total. Two decades\nearlier, the number was 410,000. Around 10,000 international couples got\ndivorced in 2020, statistics from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare\nshow.\n\nLEGAL COMPLICATIONS FOR FOREIGNERS\n\nYuji Kimura, 72, a counselor at the Network for Foreigners\u2019 Assistance Kobe,\nsaid arbitration should be sought when there is at least one disagreement in\nthe divorce process.\n\nJudges and arbitrators work together to resolve cases in which the two sides\ncannot reach agreement regarding divorce, child custody, child support,\ninheritance, unpaid rent and other issues.\n\nThe mediation system is also used when one spouse refuses to accept a divorce.\nSome spouses seek arbitration without telling their partners.\n\nBut even foreign spouses who can easily converse in Japanese often face\ndifficulties understanding legal specifics.\n\n\u201cLanguage disadvantages make it impossible to have fair discussions,\u201d Kimura\nsaid. \u201cAll decisions should be recorded in documents.\u201d\n\nMuranishi of the group once attended a divorce mediation meeting as an English\ninterpreter for a Filipino woman.\n\n\u201cThe arbitrator there listened only to the story of the Japanese husband,\u201d\nMuranishi said, adding that the wife struggled to speak in her poor Japanese,\nand her opinions were not taken seriously.\n\nKimura participated in an arbitration session as a Thai interpreter but was\ntold to leave the meeting room for \u201cprivacy reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was stunned by the fact that arbitrators lack an understanding\u201d of the\ntroubles facing foreigners, Kimura said. \u201cI would like knowledgeable people to\nserve as arbitrators regardless of their nationality.\u201d\n\nREJECTIONS NATIONWIDE\n\nLast December, the Hyogo Bar Association on its website called for arbitrators\nto be \u201cappointed without regard to nationality.\u201d\n\nThe bar association recommended two South Korean lawyers as arbitrators last\nautumn. But the Kobe District Court and the Kobe Family Court refused to\nnominate them for the Supreme Court\u2019s screening.\n\nThe reasoning was that they did \u201cnot have Japanese nationality.\u201d\n\nMasaaki Yoshii, 77, an attorney who chairs a project team working within the\nJapan Federation of Bar Associations to incorporate arbitrators of foreign\nnationalities, said the Hyogo Bar Association recommended a non-Japanese\nlawyer way back in 2003.\n\nThe Kobe Family Court rejected the nomination, as well as all non-Japanese\nlawyers who have been recommended since then.\n\nThe situation is the same nationwide. Records show that all foreign lawyers\nrecommended as arbitrators by bar associations in Tokyo and Osaka Prefecture\nsince around 2006 have been rejected.\n\nAccording to Yoshii, bar associations in Hyogo Prefecture, Osaka Prefecture,\nTokushima Prefecture and Sapporo released statements last year, protesting\ncourts\u2019 refusals to accept arbitrators of foreign nationalities.\n\nThe Japan Federation of Bar Associations has published similar statements\nmultiple times.\n\nNO CLEAR LEGAL BASIS\n\nThe Civil Mediation Law and other related rules include no provisions about\nnationality requirements for arbitrators.\n\nSo how can courts turn away non-Japanese arbitrators?\n\nIn response to an inquiry from the Japan Federation of Bar Associations, the\nSupreme Court stated in 2008 that arbitrators are considered \u201cpublic servants\ninvolved in exercising administrative authority or in the formation of the\nnational will.\u201d\n\nA Kobe District Court official told The Asahi Shimbun that \u201cdescriptions in\nrecords about mediation processes are as effective as final judgments, and the\narbitrators\u2019 committee also has the authority to investigate facts.\n\n\u201cThis constitutes the exercise of administrative authority or the formation of\nthe national will.\u201d\n\nYoshii said people with qualifications and abilities should be accepted\nirrespective of nationality.\n\n\u201cTheir (arbitrators\u2019) duty of facilitating discussions to reach settlements\ncan never be called as contributing to the formation of the national will,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cRejecting them with no legal basis is unacceptable in a law-abiding\nnation.\u201d\n\nBaek Seung-ho, a 62-year-old South Korean lawyer who is a former chair of the\nHyogo Bar Association, said he has been rejected more than 10 times.\n\n\u201cI want to know why my serving as an arbitrator will create problems,\u201d Baek\nsaid. \u201cCourts remain unchanged while Japanese society is now heading toward\nrespecting human rights and eliminating discrimination over gender and other\nissues.\u201d\n\n## Related News\n\n  * Parents\u2019 lawsuit accuses Japan of double standard on child \u2018abductions\u2019\n\nFebruary 26, 2020\n\n  * EDITORIAL: Time to revamp flagging system to recruit legal eagles as judges\n\nSeptember 30, 2023\n\n  * Court rules single-parent custody system constitutional\n\nFebruary 18, 2021\n\n  * Japan\u2019s civil court processes set to be fully computerized\n\nMay 18, 2022\n\n  * Government panel proposes joint custody for divorced parents\n\nJanuary 31, 2024\n\n  * Australian man\u2019s trial in custody dispute draws foreign media\n\nJanuary 12, 2020\n\n  * Share\n  * Tweet list\n\n  * Print\n\n## Trending Now\n\n  1.
