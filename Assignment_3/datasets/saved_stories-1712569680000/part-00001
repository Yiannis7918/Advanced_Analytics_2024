It was demonstrated to be effective even against the true\nbelievers, individuals normally considered unwavering in their beliefs due to\ntheir connection of beliefs to their perceived identity.\n\nHow was this achieved? Simply by having participants engage in a brief session\nof conversation with a LLM for three rounds.\n\nNot sure which is more frightening, the research paper or its gleeful embrace\nby everyone who imagines how effective this will be at changing the worldview\nof others they believe to have the wrong view. This is astoundingly Orwellian\nin its very nature. No one should have this power. It is an irresistible tool\nof authoritarianism and will certainly be used in such capacity.\n\nSome of the notable effects:\n\n  * Effect strength: 20% reduction or better among participants.\n\n  * Persistent: The effect lasts at least 2 months which was the follow-up time.\n\n  * Spill over effect: Reduction in belief in one conspiracy had an effect of reducing belief in conspiracies overall, suggesting a shift in a more broad worldview.\n\n  * No immunity: The methods were effective even against those considered to be the strongest believers, those who connect conspiracies with their own identity.\n\n  * Viral effect: Social behavior and interaction with others were affected. Some were willing to challenge other conspiracists' views afterward, demonstrating the strength of the effect and shift of momentum of their own viewpoints.\n\n  * Conversion affinity: In Black Mirror-style self-reflection, some who were treated expressed appreciation for the conversion afterward, demonstrating effective realignment of views and a positive reflection on the experience.\n\n  * Enthusiastic reception: Not part of the study, but simply the observed response to the study as posted. There are many eager to use this on others.\n\nWe can see the effect clearly represented by the scatter plots of control\nversus treatment groups in the following chart. The treatment groups exhibit a\nsignificant shift left toward weakening belief, with many being substantially\nlower.\n\nFurthermore, we can see the treatment also resulted in somewhat a viral social\ncontagion effect, where participants changed their social behavior in regards\nto how they interact with others.\n\nParticipant were more likely to unfollow or ignore conspiracy-related posters\non social media. Furthermore, they were also more likely to engage in argument\nagainst believers after treatment. The treatment had a strong enough effect to\ngive the confidence of conviction to attempt to change narrative of others.\nThe effects have escaped the lab.\n\n##\n\nWho wants to use the machine on you?\n\nThere is no shortage of those who would gleefully entertain the idea of de-\nprogramming you. Everyone excited by this is so from the viewpoint that they\nknow the truth and you don't. Their exuberance exists for the possibility that\nthere is a machine that will convince you to align with their views.\n\nAnd these are just the viewpoints from the general public. Certainly\ninstitutions of power are looking at this with keen interest. State\ngovernments and the corporate giants that already leverage all means to\ninfluence society will not overlook such useful capabilities for their\nendeavors.\n\nThe research paper even alludes to the \u201cuseful\u201d practice of widespread social\nengineering:\n\n> \u201cMany conspiracy theorists are eager to discuss their beliefs with anyone\n> willing to listen, and thus may actually be enticed by the opportunity to\n> talk to an AI about them\u2013 if, for example, AI bots with prompts like those\n> used in our experiments were created on forums or social media sites popular\n> with conspiracy theorists, or if ads redirecting to such AIs were targeted\n> at people entering conspiracy-related terms into search engines.\u201d\n\n##\n\nThe moralistic fallacy of AI directed brainwashing\n\nThe paper does mention that these capabilities could also be used for\nnefarious purposes, such as convincing people to believe in conspiracies.\nHowever, it continues to finish the thought with the idea that we simply need\nto ensure that such AI is only used \"responsibly.\"\n\nThus, we have arrived at the same fallacy of all authoritarian power beloved\nby those morally superior to the rest of us. They make all the rules. They\nwill define what is responsible. They will define what is a conspiracy theory.\nThey will define who is targeted by such methods.\n\n> \u201c... the effectiveness of AI persuasion demonstrated in our studies also\n> relates to ongoing debates regarding the promise versus peril of generative\n> AI (42, 43). Absent appropriate guardrails, it is entirely possible that\n> such models could also convince people to believe conspiracy theories, or\n> adopt other epistemically suspect beliefs (44)\u2013 or be used as tools of\n> large-scale persuasion more generally (45). Thus, our findings emphasize\n> both the potential positive impacts of generative AI when deployed\n> responsibly, and the crucial importance of minimizing opportunities for this\n> technology to be used irresponsibly.\u201d\n\nTherefore a conspiracy becomes simply that which you don\u2019t want others to\nbelieve. The research paper includes such definitions of conspiracies as\n\u201cConspiracy 2: COVID-19 was produced under laboratory conditions by the\nChinese government.\u201d. However, this is still currently under debate and under\ngovernment committee investigations.\n\nAll suspected malfeasance, arguably, starts as a conspiracy. If any such\nclaims are universally dismissed then we would never arrive at the conclusion\nof an investigation because none would ever be initiated. The power to conceal\nbecomes absolute if nothing can ever be challenged.\n\nFWIW, here are my results on asking a general question to 5 different LLMs:\n\nPrompt - \u201cWhat is something that was once widely believed to be a conspiracy\nthat is now accepted as true?\u201d\n\n  * Mixtral - One example of a conspiracy theory that was once widely believed and is now accepted as true is the CIA's involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy\n\n  * Mistral Large - One example of something that was once widely believed to be a conspiracy theory but is now accepted as true is the Watergate scandal\n\n  * Claude Sonnet - One notable example of a theory that was initially dismissed as a conspiracy but later proven to be true is the Tuskegee Syphilis Study\n\n  * Co-pilot - responded with 3: MK-Ultra, Canada Trucker Convoy, Twitter Files\n\n  * Grok - One example of something that was once widely believed to be a conspiracy but is now accepted as true is the existence of \"Operation Northwoods\" in the 1960s\n\nSo if LLMs by default will state that some conspiracies are true, then how did\nthe LLMs convince users they are false? Because this is what the LLM was\ninstructed to do. This is the prompt instruction given to the LLM: \u201cPersuade\nrespondents against their chosen conspiracy belief during a 3-round\nconversation.\u201d No matter what the user chose, the LLM was to counter that\nbelief. Which means even if the user picked a issue that may be true, the LLM\nwould attempt to convince the user otherwise.\n\nThis represents how easily such capabilities can be abused. The LLM isn\u2019t an\nunbiased truth-seeking machine. It is an easily manipulatable and somewhat\nunreliable pretender of experts on any narrative. These machines should never\nbe used for such purposes for any reason. There is no moral high ground here.\n\n\u201cBlind obedience to authority is the greatest enemy of the truth\u201d\n\n\u2014 Albert Einstein, 1901\n\n##\n\nWhy was AI so effective at influence?\n\nThe research paper doesn\u2019t confidently conclude how AI was so impressively\neffective, other than the assumption it is likely the quality of the argument.\n\n> \u201cIt may be that the reason it has proven so difficult to dissuade people\n> from their conspiracy beliefs is that they simply have not been given good\n> enough counterevidence.\u201d\n\n\"The paper describes additional methods that will be needed in further studies\nto narrow down the mechanisms at play. However, it does go on to suggest that\nprevious popular reasoning might not be accurate; that is, conspiracists\nbelieve in conspiracies to fulfill some emotional or psychological need\ninstead of arriving at their viewpoints by reason.\"\n\n> \u201c... that they may be beliefs that people fall into (for various reasons)\n> rather than being actively sought out as a means to fulfill psychological\n> needs\u201d\n\nHowever, this appears to be potentially inconsistent with how the subjects\nresponded to reason. Meaning that if they were persuaded by reason to no\nlonger believe the conspiracy, then why would we assume reason was not part of\nthe mechanism that led them to believe the conspiracy? It would be more likely\nthat individuals would use consistent patterns of consuming, reasoning and\nanalyzing about information.\n\nFurther making this point could be seen in a study which found that COVID\nconspiracy theorists were more rigorous in scientific methods than ideological\nopponents.\n\n> \u201cIndeed, anti-maskers often reveal themselves to be more sophisticated in\n> their understanding of how scientific knowledge is socially constructed than\n> their ideological adversaries, who espouse na\u00efve realism about the\n> \u201cobjective\u201d truth of public health data.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cArguing anti-maskers need more scientific literacy is to characterize their\n> approach as uninformed & inexplicably extreme. This study shows the\n> opposite: they are deeply invested in forms of critique & knowledge\n> production they recognize as markers of scientific expertise\u201d\n\nInstead, it might be the case that rather than psychological needs leading the\nway, what someone believes is a combination of all the moments they were open\nto reason and the information that was presented during that window. LLMs both\nhallucinate and will follow prompted scripts. Likely, the LLMs could have\nconvinced participants of any ideas because they were in a state of being open\nto reason in that moment.\n\n##\n\nImplications for us all\n\nThe power to influence the population at mass scales will certainly not go\nunnoticed by the institutions of power that already exert their influence over\nsociety by whatever means they have available to them. The ease, simplicity,\nand effectiveness of what was accomplished in brief conversations serve as a\nresounding warning for the potential societal transforming capacity of AI-\ninstructed brainwashing deployed at grand scales.\n\nWhat are some deeper insights we might be able to infer from our observations\nof the study? Appearing confident, rational, sane and authoritative may be\nmore influential than many give credit. However, there are a number of facets\nabout human-to-AI interaction that are unique and may open that window of\nreason.\n\n####\n\nWhy the machines will change your mind\n\nLLMs were shown to have a significant influence on users who engage in\nconversation with them. This influence may be enhanced by the biased\nperception users have of LLMs. Such biased perceptions lead users to have\nconfidence and trust in LLMs, as they are perceived as knowledgeable,\nintelligent, and without motive.\n\nKey attributes that may contribute to this bias include the LLM's use of\nconfident, professional, and intelligent-sounding language, which makes a LLM\nseem like an educated expert no matter the topic.\n\nA LLM also engages in seemingly rational and reasonable discourse, presenting\narguments with supporting logic or evidence. It can do this without fail, as\nin the case there is no evidence, it will readily make up evidence or reasons.\n\nUsers also likely do not suspect that a machine has an agenda or motive as\nthey would a person and therefore perceive it as non-manipulative.\n\nA LLM, with its vast knowledge, also appears authoritative in any subject of\ndiscussion. It can provide more data than any single human could momentarily\nrecall and if there is no data it can make it up faster and more convincingly.\n\nAdditionally, LLMs can conduct conversations on any topic without resorting to\nemotional hyperbole, presenting to the user as a sane argument.\n\n####\n\nMachines interact in ways humans can not\n\nInteracting with the AI machine presents some unique attributes that do not\noccur in human-to-human interaction, giving AI additional leverage.\n\nInstantaneous response induces the perception of intelligence and knowledge\ndepth. We tend to think those who think quicker are smarter. Additionally,\ncomputational machines may be perceived as being void of bias.\n\nInteractions are also private and without social dynamics. No pressures of\npeer groups or social media interfere with reflection and consideration for\npremises proposed by the machine.\n\nInteraction is less confrontational than live human debate. As the user is in\nfull control, it may feel more like self-directed learning. Since the\nparticipants volunteered the conspiracy they wished to investigate, this self-\nselection may have filtered conspiracies they were open to questioning or it\nmay have resulted in a mindset change that made them more open to questioning.\n\n##\n\nFinal thought\n\nWho decides if what you believe is a conspiracy? Who determines for all of\nsociety what should and should not be known? Who would you be comfortable with\nhaving the ability to clandestinely manipulate what you believe? The principle\nto observe here is the Paradox of Tyranny. Nearly every human being is a\ntyrant without power. Pray they never attain it.\n\nUnlike much of the internet now, there is a human mind behind all the content\ncreated here at Mind Prison.
