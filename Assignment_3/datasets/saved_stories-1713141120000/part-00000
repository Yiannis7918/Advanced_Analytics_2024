Cancer diagnoses among those under\n50 has risen by about 80% worldwide over the past 30 years. As of 2023, cancer\nis the second-leading cause of death both in the U.S. and around the world.\nWhile death rates from cancer have decreased over the past few decades, about\n1 in 3 patients in the U.S. and 1 in 2 patients worldwide still die from\ncancer.\n\nDespite advances in standard cancer treatments, many cancer patients still\nface uncertain outcomes when these treatments prove ineffective. Depending on\nthe stage and location of the cancer and the patient\u2019s medical history, most\ncancer types are treated with a mix of radiation, surgery and drugs. But if\nthose standard treatments fail, patients and doctors enter a trial-and-error\nmaze where effective treatments become difficult to predict because of limited\ninformation on the patient\u2019s cancer.\n\nMy mission as a cancer researcher is to build a personalized guide of the most\neffective drugs for every cancer patient. My team and I do this by testing\ndifferent medications on a patient\u2019s own cancer cells before administering\ntreatment, tailoring therapies that are most likely to selectively kill tumors\nwhile minimizing toxic effects.\n\nIn our newly published results of the first clinical trial combining drug\nsensitivity testing with DNA testing to identify effective treatments in\nchildren with cancer, an approach called functional precision medicine, we\nfound this approach can help match patients with more FDA-approved treatment\noptions and significantly improve outcomes.\n\n## What is functional precision medicine?\n\nEven though two people with the same cancer might get the same medicine, they\ncan have very different outcomes. Because each patient\u2019s tumor is unique, it\ncan be challenging to know which treatment works best.\n\nTo solve this problem, doctors analyze DNA mutations in the patient\u2019s tumor,\nblood or saliva to match cancer medicines to patients. This approach is called\nprecision medicine. However, the relationship between cancer DNA and how\neffective medicines will be against them is very complex. Matching medications\nto patients based on a single mutation overlooks other genetic and nongenetic\nmechanisms that influence how cells respond to drugs.\n\nFunctional precision medicine involves testing drugs on tumor samples to see\nwhich ones work best.\n\nHow to best match medicines to patients through DNA is still a major\nchallenge. Overall, only 10% of cancer patients experience a clinical benefit\nfrom treatments matched to tumor DNA mutations.\n\nFunctional precision medicine takes a different approach to personalizing\ntreatments. My team and I take a sample of a patient\u2019s cancer cells from a\nbiopsy, grow the cells in the lab and expose them to over 100 drugs approved\nby the Food and Drug Administration. In this process, called drug sensitivity\ntesting, we look for the medications that kill the cancer cells.\n\n## New clinical trial results\n\nProviding functional precision medicine to cancer patients in real life is\nvery challenging. Off-label use of drugs and financial restrictions are key\nbarriers. The health of cancer patients can also deteriorate rapidly, and\nphysicians may be hesitant to try new methods.\n\nBut this is starting to change. Two teams in Europe recently showed that\nfunctional precision medicine could match effective treatments to about 55% of\nadult patients with blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma that did not\nrespond to standard treatments.\n\nMost recently, my team\u2019s clinical trial focused on childhood cancer patients\nwhose cancer came back or didn\u2019t respond to treatment. We applied our\nfunctional precision medicine approach to 25 patients with different types of\ncancer.\n\nResearchers are testing a functional precision medicine approach to cancer\ntreatment in both children and adults. Pornpak Khunatorn/iStock via Getty\nImages Plus\n\nOur trial showed that we could provide treatment options for almost all\npatients in less than two weeks. My colleague Arlet Maria Acanda de la Rocha\nwas instrumental in helping return drug sensitivity data to patients as fast\nas possible. We were able to provide test results within 10 days of receiving\na sample, compared with the roughly 30 days that standard genomic testing\nresults that focus on identifying specific cancer mutations typically take to\nprocess.\n\nMost importantly, our study showed that 83% of cancer patients who received\ntreatments guided by our approach had clinical benefit, including improved\nresponse and survival.\n\n## Expanding into the real world\n\nFunctional precision medicine opens new paths to understanding how cancer\ndrugs can be better matched to patients. Although doctors can read any\npatient\u2019s DNA today, interpreting the results to understand how a patient will\nrespond to cancer treatment is much more challenging. Combining drug\nsensitivity testing with DNA analysis can help personalize cancer treatments\nfor each patient.\n\nI, along with colleague Noah E. Berlow, have started to add artificial\nintelligence to our functional precision medicine program. AI enables us to\nanalyze each patient\u2019s data to better match them with tailored treatments and\ndrug combinations. AI also allows us to understand the complex relationships\nbetween DNA mutations within tumors and how different treatments will affect\nthem.\n\nMy team and I have started two clinical trials to expand the results of our\nprevious studies on providing treatment recommendations through functional\nprecision medicine. We\u2019re recruiting a larger cohort of adults and children\nwith cancers that have come back or are resistant to treatment.\n\nThe more data we have, the easier it will become to understand how to best\ntreat cancer and ultimately help more patients access personalized cancer\ntreatments.\n\n  * Cancer\n  * Genetics\n  * Oncology\n  * Genetic testing\n  * Tumor\n  * Cancer treatment\n  * Precision medicine\n  * Genomic testing\n  * Personalized medicine\n  * New research\n  * Cancer genetics\n  * STEEHM new research\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Faculty of Law - Academic Appointment Opportunities\n\n  * ##### Operations Manager\n\n  * ##### Senior Education Technologist\n\n  * ##### Audience Development Coordinator (fixed-term maternity cover)\n\n  * ##### Lecturer (Hindi-Urdu)\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
