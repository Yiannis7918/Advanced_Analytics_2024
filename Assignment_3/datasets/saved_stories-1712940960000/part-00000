Perhaps you're really asking \"Why did internet become the standard\nfor all networking instead of some other scheme?\"\n\n\u2013 Chris Dodd\n\n13 hours ago\n\n  * A lot of the standards/protocols that are now ubiquitous often became so because they were the only option available in certain Unix distributions. TCP/IP probably gained a lot of traction by virtue of the implementation in BSD and sysadmins not wanting or caring about alternatives. And, of course, the software was free so no need for licensing fees or any real restrictions on copying, plus access to the source code would be available which would have spurred on further development.\n\n\u2013 Noel Whitemore\n\n12 hours ago\n\n  * @Chris Dodd TCP/IP = transfer control protocol over Internet protocol. So whatever it was going to be had to be <something> over internet protocol.

All you need is\nsomething equivalent to the address resolution protocol and a computer with\nrouting tables connected to your network and any other network that is already\nconnected to the Internet.\n\nAt the time it was designed there was nothing else quite like it (and now\nthere never will be because it has got total dominance). You could find custom\nsolutions for communication between two specific network types but these\ntended not to be extensible.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered 36 secs ago\n\nJeremyPJeremyP\n\n11.6k11 gold badge3737 silver badges5353 bronze badges\n\nAdd a comment |\n\n## You must log in to answer this question.\n\n##\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
