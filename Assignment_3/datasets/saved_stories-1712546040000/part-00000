In my daydreams about boundless potential I built Taleten, a\nsocial marketplace designed for creatives to showcase and sell their work. My\nvision was to build a platform where art and commerce met in harmony, and\ncreatives could get recognition and reward.\n\nIt was a rough journey. I was so deeply enthralled in my idea that I came up\nwith 10 features with complex designs, but the product struggled to find its\nfooting. The realization soon dawned that while the vision was clear, its\nexecution was not aligned with the market's needs. I only found few users, and\nthe anticipated buzz was barely a whisper. It was a hard pill to swallow, but\nTaleten wasn't the answer the market sought. The failure was disheartening,\nbut it was also a treasure trove of lessons. It took me about two years to\nrealize that this wasn't working out.\n\nIn the aftermath, I dove into understanding where Taleten faltered:\n\n## Failure mode 1: poor validation\n\nThe first revelation was the importance of validating an idea before diving\nheadfirst into development. The only validation I had done was asking my\nartist friends what they thought of the idea instead of the real questions to\nfind their pain points.\n\nI sent out an ineffective survey that, in retrospect, was a step in the right\ndirection but was not enough. I did not set up a landing page, let alone a\ndomain because I thought that was meant for when you have a product ready. I\ndid, however, spend an entirely embarrassing and wasted amount of time\ndeciding the tech stack I should go with. Which leads me to my second lesson.\n\n## Failure mode 2: wrong tech stack\n\nThe choice of tech stack, I realized, was secondary to the solution I was\nproviding but still important. This one came down to the experience I did not\nhave. At this point, I was only familiar with basic programming and had never\nbuilt a real product that lived outside of my terminal window. I didn't have\nan internship or someone around me to tell me that I should go with:\n\n  1. something you know, which for me should've been python/Django or java/spring, and\n  2. choose a tech stack with a good community.\n\nI worried about should I be using a MySQL or PostgreSQL database, and which\nPHP framework would work best for this and other silly mistakes a young rookie\nindie hacker would make.\n\nI learned that Facebook was built with PHP so I decided to learn PHP/Laravel\nfrom scratch just because I thought \"Since the big players are doing that, so\nshould I.\" Which is another mistake that I made: my comparison should not have\nbeen with a company that started 15+ years ago because they were working with\nthe technology that limited them. I should've been looking at projects or\ncompanies from the last 3-5 years instead.\n\n## Failure mode 3: poor marketing\n\nNext mistake I made, and I would say is the biggest one of them all, was\nthinking that marketing wasn't necessary if I just built a good enough\nproject.\n\nI imagined, and partly due to articles and movies, that if I just build the\nproduct then people will come. I was also limited to a college student budget\nso my marketing likely would not have taken me far. All I knew about marketing\nwas posting to social media and Facebook and Google ads. I didn't know how to\nfind my target audience and how to appeal to them. I didn't know about\nmarketing channels or building an audience.\n\n## Failure mode 4: moving too slowly\n\nLastly, I failed to launch fast to iterate based on feedback and focus on a\nminimum viable product.\n\nLimited by my skill set, I sat on the idea for an entire year (regrettably, no\nlanding page or serious validation done during this point) just gaining the\ntechnical skills and learning from other entrepreneurs on building a product\nand launching to get this project to come to fruition.\n\nThis wasn't a total waste because during this time I discovered a podcast\ncalled Masters of Scale by Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn. In many of his\nepisodes, he mentions that you should launch quickly and if you're not\nembarrassed by your first product, then it's too late. I eventually took this\nadvice, but I misapplied it. As soon as I heard it, I realized I'd wasted time\nand started rushing the development of the project accordingly, and I launched\nversion one several months later. I made every mistake in the book with this\none, including:\n\n  1. Bad design. I neglected the design of the web app to get it out to market quickly. I tried to do this myself but I am in no way a designer and because I took it too literal that I should launch quickly, I made a very unappealing website. Undoubtedly, this ended up costing me way more time and money when I worked on version 2 of the site.\n\n  2. Building in private. Because of my shyness in college, I built the entire thing in private. The only thing that applied to me from Reid Hoffman's advice was that I was totally embarrassed by the result of my work. I didn't do a beta test or talk about my product with anyone until the launch.\n\n  3. No niche. My target audience was too broad. I learned the hard lesson that finding the right audience, especially early adopters who were more willing to try new things, was crucial. I wanted to target all types of creatives in art. With what I know now, I would narrow that down to something like indie hip/hop producers in rural areas of the US.\n\nIn the end, I tried moving so fast that I blew a tire and took more time\ngetting the repairs done.\n\n## Honorable mentions\n\nOther mistakes I made and lessons I've learned include:\n\n  1. Single-player mode. Not getting help from people. A buddy of mine wanted to help with the idea and I fended him off, not because I didn't want his help but because I just didn't know what I was doing or how to delegate tasks.\n\n  2. Sales. Not learning how to sell.\n\n  3. Custom code. Building the landing page from scratch instead of using a website builder. Looking back, this was possibly the worst time spent.\n\n  4. Vanity metrics. Using google analytics just to look at vanity metrics like how many visitors came to the site and when nobody would sign up, I did nothing about it except change the wording of the site. Only after reading The Lean Startup was when I learned what to do about this.\n\nUltimately, these mistakes led me to working on this project for almost two\nyears without any traction. But I don't see any of this as a waste of time. I\nalways say that I enrolled in a two-year, self-paced masterclass. I gained\nvaluable technical skills, learned about, and studied the greats, joined\ninteresting forums like Indie Hackers, read many books on entrepreneurship and\nbusiness, learned how to move fast, I got out of my shell and got better at\nspeaking to people.\n\n## My latest project\n\nNow at 24, I stand at the helm of Halisi, my third project, an AI-driven\npersonal finance assistant. Halisi is not just a product; it's the culmination\nof my journey, a testament to the resilience and wisdom gained from past\nfailures. With each lesson learned, Halisi was crafted with a clearer focus, a\nbetter understanding of its users, and a more defined purpose.\n\nHalisi, unlike Taleten, I set out to validate the idea as soon as possible\nwith a landing page and domain. I will be launching faster, with a simple,\nuser-friendly design, and an MVP that addresses the core needs of my audience.\nMarketing strategies are in place before the launch, targeting a specific\naudience of young tech-savvy individuals looking for an efficient way to\nmanage their finances. This has been the most efficient and effective use of\nmy time on any of my projects. I have spent a total of two and a half months\non Halisi. Simultaneously, validating the idea (that includes getting a\ndomain, setting up the landing page, reaching out to potential customers,\ngetting feedback through surveys), two days to choose the tech stack, and\nbuilding a minimum viable product, all while building in public.\n\nAs Halisi grows, so do I. Each day brings new challenges, but also new\nopportunities to learn and improve. The journey from Taleten to Halisi is more\nthan a story of projects; it's a tale of personal growth, perseverance, and\nthe relentless pursuit of a dream. In the world of startups, success is not\nguaranteed, but armed with experience, insight, and an unyielding spirit, I\nstand ready to navigate the ever-changing tides of the tech world.\n\nBefore you leave, I am taking this \"build in public\" seriously and hope that I\nam taking a step in the right direction. Please help us by giving checking out\nour landing page and leaving us feedback https://halisiai.com/. We will have a\nbeta launch soon for the first 100 users.\n\nThank you fellow hackers\n\nMoustapha\n\nposted to\n\nLessons learned\n\non February 1, 2024\n\nSay something nice to mous...\n\nPost Comment\n\n  1. 2\n\nA great post!

Do you feel they\u2019re always required (instead of a page in which users can try out the real product, for example)?\n    2. Which website do you recommend for building one?\n\nmatheusml\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 months ago\n\n\u00b7\n\nReply\n\n    1. 1\n\nThanks for the question. In this day and age, not having a landing pages is\nalmost impossible to live with and can be seen as a red flag. People need to\nsee at least some digital trace of your product in order for them to even\nconsider it.\n\nIf you want a simple, ready to go landing page, I would recommend carrd.co.\nThey allow for one page landing pages which is all you need for validating\nideas. I think it's <$20 a year. Later on you can transition to wix or\nsomething like that once your product becomes more robust.\n\nmous\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 months ago\n\n\u00b7\n\nReply\n\n  7. 1\n\nMajor street cred for not stopping. I had the wind knocked out of me pretty\nbadly. Took me years to finally commit to a new project and accept the cold\nplunge of it all. Any new learnings about developing/launching an AI product\nvs non-AI? In other words, anything from the AI experience that you would add\nto your \"how to start a company\" toolkit?\n\njosephahlo\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 months ago\n\n\u00b7\n\nReply\n\n    1. 1\n\nWith the popularity surge of AI, it brings a lot of competition into the\nmarket. I would say that right now it's about finding a niche that your tool\ncan help leveraging AI. Broad markets are tougher to get excited with AI right\nnow and cost a lot. I wouldn't make AI the big selling point. Moreso, what can\nthis tool do that AI is helping with. Also need to factor in cost if using an\nLLM. Some generations don't care about AI, typically older. Younger\ngenerations are more receptive to it. Understanding this will help with\nmarketing.\n\nHope this helps\n\nmous\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 months ago\n\n\u00b7\n\nReply\n\n  8. 1\n\nGreat lessons! How did you get people to respond to the surveys? Did you just\nsend them to friends and family? I have a hard time getting people to give me\na few minutes of their time or fill that survey out.\n\nsteelblad3r7\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 months ago\n\n\u00b7\n\nReply\n\n    1. 1\n\nSure. I've heard of a few ways to do it. The most obvious is asking them once\nthey sign up to check their emails for a survey. That works if the person\ncares to help as most people won't fill out a survey for you. What I did was\ntry to incentivize people.\n\nI would do something for the person for free and then ask them if they could\nhelp with a task. In my case, I went to a tech conference and gave undergrad\nstudents job referrals. Then after a few days I'd reach out and say \"hey can\nyou help me with something\" and then give them the link. Because I did\nsomething for them, they felt happier to help me. Not only were they my target\ndemographic but they also gave me good information to work with.\n\nFor you it can be anything. Maybe offer something once they complete the\nsurvey like cash or a giveaway.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nmous\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 months ago\n\n\u00b7\n\nReply\n\n      1. 1\n\nGreat advice, thanks!\n\nsteelblad3r7\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 months ago\n\n\u00b7\n\nReply\n\n  9. 1\n\nany tips on how to sell?\n\nKota\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 months ago\n\n\u00b7\n\nReply\n\n    1. 1\n\nThe best advice I heard was to sell to people who actually want to be sold.\nThis means to look for people who really could use your product instead of\ntrying to convince someone to buy something they've been missing there whole\nlife when in reality, they could've done without it.\n\nAlso, don't tell the potential customer why the product is so great. Instead,\nexplain to them how it could improve their lives. Alex Harmozi has great\nvideos on this.\n\nI target students and I know students are usually financially insecure so I\ntell them that using my app will help them improve their financial literacy\nand help put them in a better spot.\n\nmous\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 months ago\n\n\u00b7\n\nReply\n\n      1. 1\n\nthank you very much mous!\n\nKota\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 months ago\n\n\u00b7\n\nReply\n\n  10. 1\n\nGreat Post!

My theory is most people who sign up for the product are going to be\nvery similar and this will be my target audience.\n\nIf you only have a landing page, it's less about the analytics and more about\nbringing the right audience to the page. The point is to use is as an mvp\nbefore the prototype mvp.\n\nGood luck with everything.\n\nmous\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 months ago\n\n\u00b7\n\nReply\n\n      1. 1\n\nGotcha, so focusing on the building the right audience.
