Initially this is often done with playful tools, ranging from the\nBeebot robot to Scratch Junior or Scratch. After using such tools, kids often\nwant to move to more powerful, textual programming languages, like Python.\n\nPython however is hard, because it is only available in English, and requires\nlearners to learn complex programming concepts and syntax at once. Hedy is the\neasy way to get started with textual programming languages! Hedy is free to\nuse, open source, and unlike any other textual programming language in three\nways.\n\n  1. Hedy is multi-lingual, you can use Hedy in your own language\n  2. Hedy is gradual, so you can learn one concept and its syntax a time\n  3. Hedy is built for the classroom, allowing teachers to fully customize their student's experience\n\n### Multi-lingual programming\n\nWhile almost all textual programming language have keywords in English, such\nas for or repeat, Hedy can be used in any language! We currently support 47\ndifferent languages, including Dutch, Spanish, Arabic, Turkish, Chinese and\nHindi. If your language is not available you can always start a new\ntranslation.\n\n### Step by step learning\n\nLearning a programming language can be overwhelming, since learners have to\nlearn concepts (for example if-else or loops) and syntax (like quotation marks\nor round brackets) at the same time. In Hedy, concepts are first introduced\nwith little syntax and then refined. A scientifically proven way to learn!\n\n### Built for the classroom\n\nHedy is suitable for kids aged 10 and up and designed for classroom use.\nTeachers can use our free, built-in lesson plans, but can also author their\nown lessons and load these into the Hedy user interface.\n\n## Programming in context\n\nHedy shows programming in the broadest way possible, and can be used in\nvariety of exciting ways. Hedy allows for the creation of digital and\ninteractive stories, colorful drawings that can be shown on the screen but\nalso drawn with a pen plotter or embroidered on a shirt, and can be used to\ncreate games or apps with buttons and keyboard actions.\n\n### Is Hedy free?\n\nYes! Hedy is 'Open source', which means that everyone can help us make Hedy\nbetter. You can find our code on Github. If you like Hedy and want to\ncontribute, we accept (and are very grateful for) donations!\n\n### Do I need to install anything?\n\nNo. Hedy works in the browser, which is the program you are using to look at\nthis page. Probably Chrome or Edge or Firefox. Hedy also works on phones and\ntablets.\n\n### Do I need programming experience to teach with Hedy?\n\nNo, that is not needed. All concepts are explained in the slides and in the\ninterface for learners. If you create a free teacher's account, you also get\naccess to the teacher's manual with information on how to teach and frequently\nmade mistakes.\n\nSubscribe to the newsletter Learn more Teacher manual Privacy terms\n\nHedy on Github Become a sponsor Discord server Translating Hedy \u2709\ufe0f\nhello@hedy.org\n\nYou've earned an achievement!\n\n### <achievement_reached_title>\n\n<achievement_reached_text>\n\n<achievement_reached_statics>\n\n", "frontpage": false}
