He wanted\npoor farmers to grow other crops, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes, as a\nsource of their own food and to improve their quality of life.^[3] Under his\nleadership, the Experiment Station at Tuskegee published over forty practical\nbulletins for farmers, many written by him, which included recipes; many of\nthe bulletins contained advice for poor farmers, including combating soil\ndepletion with limited financial means, producing bigger crops, and preserving\nfood.\n\nApart from his work to improve the lives of farmers, Carver was also a leader\nin promoting environmentalism.^[4] He received numerous honors for his work,\nincluding the Spingarn Medal of the NAACP. In an era of high racial\npolarization, his fame reached beyond the black community. He was widely\nrecognized and praised in the white community for his many achievements and\ntalents. In 1941, Time magazine dubbed Carver a \"Black Leonardo\".^[5]\n\nColor film of Carver shot in 1937 at the Tuskegee Institute by African\nAmerican surgeon Allen Alexander was added to the National Film Registry of\nthe Library of Congress in 2019.^[6]^[7] The 12 minutes of footage includes\nCarver in his apartment, office and laboratory, as well as images of him\ntending flowers and displaying his paintings.\n\n## Early years\n\nThe farmhouse of Moses Carver (built in 1881), near the place where George\nCarver lived as a youth\n\nCarver was born into slavery, in Diamond Grove, (now Diamond, Newton County,\nMissouri), near Crystal Palace, sometime in the early 1860s. The date of his\nbirth is uncertain and was not known to Carver because it was before slavery\nwas abolished in Missouri, which occurred in January 1865, during the American\nCivil War. His enslaver, Moses Carver, was a German American immigrant, who\nhad purchased George's parents, Mary and Giles, from William P. McGinnis on\nOctober 9, 1855, for $700 (~$18,133 in 2023).^[3]^[8]^[1]\n\nGiles died before George was born and when he was a week old, he, his sister,\nand his mother were kidnapped by night raiders from Arkansas. George's\nbrother, James, was rushed to safety from the kidnappers. The kidnappers sold\nthe trio in Kentucky. Moses Carver hired John Bentley to find them, but he\nfound only the infant George. Moses negotiated with the raiders to gain the\nboy's return and rewarded Bentley. After slavery was abolished, Moses Carver\nand his wife, Susan, raised George and his older brother, James, as their own\nchildren. They encouraged George to continue his intellectual pursuits, and\n\"Aunt Susan\" taught him the basics of reading and writing.^[9]\n\nBlack people were not allowed at the public school in Diamond Grove. George\ndecided to go to a school for black children 10 miles (16 km) south, in\nNeosho. When he reached the town, he found the school closed for the night. He\nslept in a nearby barn. By his own account, the next morning he met a kind\nwoman, Mariah Watkins, from whom he wished to rent a room. When he identified\nhimself as \"Carver's George\", as he had done his whole life, she replied that\nfrom now on his name was \"George Carver\". George liked Mariah Watkins and her\nwords, \"You must learn all you can, then go back out into the world and give\nyour learning back to the people\", made a great impression on him.^[10]\n\nAt age 13, because he wanted to attend the academy there, he moved to the home\nof another foster family, in Fort Scott, Kansas. After witnessing the killing\nof a black man by a group of white people, Carver left the city. He attended a\nseries of schools before earning his diploma at Minneapolis High School in\nMinneapolis, Kansas.\n\nDuring his time spent in Minneapolis, there was another George Carver in town,\nwhich caused confusion over receiving mail. Carver chose a middle initial at\nrandom and began requesting letters to him be addressed to George W. Carver.\nSomeone once asked if the \"W\" stood for Washington, and Carver grinned and\nsaid, \"Why not?\" However, he never used Washington as his middle name, and\nsigned his name as either George W. Carver or simply George Carver.^[11]\n\n## College education\n\nCarver at work in his laboratory\n\nCarver applied to several colleges before being accepted at Highland\nUniversity in Highland, Kansas. When he arrived, they refused to let him\nattend because of his race.^[12]^[13] In August 1886, Carver traveled by wagon\nwith J. F. Beeler from Highland to Eden Township in Ness County, Kansas.^[14]\nHe homesteaded a claim^[15] near Beeler, where he maintained a small\nconservatory of plants and flowers and a geological collection. He manually\nplowed 17 acres (69,000 m^2) of the claim, planting rice, corn, Indian corn\nand garden produce, as well as various fruit trees, forest trees, and\nshrubbery. He also earned money by odd jobs in town and worked as a ranch\nhand.^[14]\n\nIn early 1888, Carver obtained a $300 (~$10,173 in 2023) loan at the Bank of\nNess City for education. By June he left the area.^[14] In 1890, Carver\nstarted studying art and piano at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa.^[16] His\nart teacher, Etta Budd, recognized Carver's talent for painting flowers and\nplants; she encouraged him to study botany at Iowa State Agricultural College\n(now Iowa State University) in Ames.^[16]\n\nWhen he began there in 1891, he was the first black student at Iowa\nState.^[17] Carver's bachelor's thesis for a degree in Agriculture was \"Plants\nas Modified by Man\", dated 1894.^[18]^[19] Iowa State University professors\nJoseph Budd and Louis Pammel convinced Carver to continue there for his\nmaster's degree.^[17] Carver did research at the Iowa Experiment Station under\nPammel during the next two years. His work at the experiment station in plant\npathology and mycology first gained him national recognition and respect as a\nbotanist. Carver received his Master of Science degree in 1896.^[19] Carver\ntaught as the first black faculty member at Iowa State.\n\nDespite occasionally being addressed as \"doctor\", Carver never received an\nofficial doctorate, and in a personal communication with Pammel, he noted that\nit was a \"misnomer\", given to him by others due to his abilities and their\nassumptions about his education.^[20] Though he did not have an earned\ndoctorate, both Simpson College and Selma University awarded him honorary\ndoctorates of science in his lifetime.^[20]^[21] In addition, Iowa State\nawarded him a posthumous doctor of humane letters degree in 1994.^[22]\n\n## Tuskegee Institute\n\nGeorge Washington Carver, front row, center, poses with fellow faculty of\nTuskegee Institute in this c. 1902 photograph taken by Frances Benjamin\nJohnston.\n\n\"George Washington Carver at Tuskegee Institute\" redirects here. For the film,\nsee George Washington Carver at Tuskegee Institute (film).\n\nIn 1896, Booker T. Washington, the first principal and president of the\nTuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), invited Carver to head its\nAgriculture Department.^[3] Carver taught there for 47 years, developing the\ndepartment into a strong research center and working with two additional\ncollege presidents during his tenure. He taught methods of crop rotation,\nintroduced several alternative cash crops for farmers that would also improve\nthe soil of areas heavily cultivated in cotton, initiated research into crop\nproducts (chemurgy), and taught generations of black students farming\ntechniques for self-sufficiency.\n\nCarver designed a mobile classroom to take education out to farmers. He called\nit a \"Jesup wagon\" after the New York financier and philanthropist Morris\nKetchum Jesup, who provided funding to support the program.^[23]\n\nTo recruit Carver to Tuskegee, Washington gave him an above average salary and\ntwo rooms for his personal use, although both concessions were resented by\nsome other faculty. Because he had earned a master's in a scientific field\nfrom a \"white\" institution, some faculty perceived him as arrogant.^[24]\nUnmarried faculty members normally had to share rooms, with two to a room, in\nthe spartan early days of the institute.\n\nOne of Carver's duties was to administer the Agricultural Experiment Station\nfarms. He had to manage the production and sale of farm products to generate\nrevenue for the institute. He soon proved to be a poor administrator and\nclashed with other faculty members, especially George Ruffin Bridgeforth.^[25]\nIn 1900, Carver complained that the physical work and the letter-writing\nrequired were too much.^[26]\n\nIn 1904, an Institute committee reported that Carver's reports on yields from\nthe poultry yard were exaggerated, and Washington confronted Carver about the\nissue. Carver replied in writing, \"Now to be branded as a liar and party to\nsuch hellish deception it is more than I can bear, and if your committee feel\nthat I have willfully lied or [was] party to such lies as were told my\nresignation is at your disposal.\"^[27] During Washington's last five years at\nTuskegee, Carver submitted or threatened his resignation several times: when\nthe administration reorganized the agriculture programs,^[28] when he disliked\na teaching assignment,^[29] to manage an experiment station elsewhere,^[30]\nand when he did not get summer teaching assignments in 1913\u201314.^[31]^[32] In\neach case, Washington smoothed things over.\n\nA photograph of George Washington Carver taken by Frances Benjamin Johnston,\n1906.\n\nCarver started his academic career as a researcher and teacher. In 1911,\nWashington wrote a letter to him complaining that Carver had not followed\norders to plant particular crops at the experiment station. This revealed\nWashington's micro-management of Carver's department, which he had headed for\nmore than 10 years by then. Washington at the same time refused Carver's\nrequests for a new laboratory, research supplies for his exclusive use, and\nrespite from teaching classes. Washington praised Carver's abilities in\nteaching and original research but said this about his administrative skills:\n\n> When it comes to the organization of classes, the ability required to secure\n> a properly organized and large school or section of a school, you are\n> wanting in ability. When it comes to the matter of practical farm managing\n> which will secure definite, practical, financial results, you are wanting\n> again in ability.\n\nIn 1911, Carver complained that his laboratory had not received the equipment\nwhich Washington had promised 11 months before. He also complained about\nInstitute committee meetings.^[33] Washington praised Carver in his 1911\nmemoir, My Larger Education: Being Chapters from My Experience.^[34]\nWashington called Carver \"one of the most thoroughly scientific men of the\nNegro race with whom I am acquainted\".^[35] After Washington died in 1915, his\nsuccessor made fewer demands on Carver for administrative tasks.\n\nFrom 1915 to 1923, Carver concentrated on researching and experimenting with\nnew uses for peanuts, sweet potatoes, soybeans, pecans, and other crops, as\nwell as having his assistants research and compile existing uses.^[36] This\nwork, and especially his speaking to a national conference of the Peanut\nGrowers Association in 1920 and in testimony before Congress in 1921 to\nsupport passage of a tariff on imported peanuts, brought him wide publicity\nand increasing renown. In these years, he became one of the most well-known\nAfrican Americans of his time.\n\n## Rise to fame\n\n\"One of America's great scientists\" \u2013 one of several Carver-centric posters by\nC. H. Alston, this one referencing the World War II effort (circa 1943)\n\nCarver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of\ncotton. Together with other agricultural experts, he urged farmers to restore\nnitrogen to their soils by practicing systematic crop rotation: alternating\ncotton crops with plantings of sweet potatoes or legumes, such as peanuts,\nsoybeans and cowpeas. These crops both restored nitrogen to the soil and were\ngood for human consumption.\n\nFollowing the crop rotation practice resulted in improved cotton yields and\ngave farmers alternative cash crops. To train farmers to successfully rotate\nand cultivate the new crops, Carver developed an agricultural extension\nprogram for Alabama that was similar to the one at Iowa State. To encourage\nbetter nutrition in the South, he widely distributed recipes using the\nalternative crops.\n\nHe founded an industrial research laboratory, where he and assistants worked\nto popularize the new crops by developing hundreds of applications for them.\nThey did original research as well as promoting applications and recipes,\nwhich they collected from others. Carver distributed his information as\nagricultural bulletins.\n\nCarver's work was known by officials in the national capital before he became\na public figure. President Theodore Roosevelt publicly admired his work.\nFormer professors of Carver's from Iowa State University were appointed to\npositions as Secretary of Agriculture: James Wilson, a former dean and\nprofessor of Carver's, served from 1897 to 1913. Henry Cantwell Wallace served\nfrom 1921 to 1924. He knew Carver personally because his son Henry A. Wallace\nand the researcher were friends.^[37] The younger Wallace served as U.S.\nSecretary of Agriculture from 1933 to 1940, and as Franklin Delano Roosevelt's\nvice president from 1941 to 1945.\n\nThe American industrialist, farmer, and inventor William C. Edenborn of Winn\nParish, Louisiana, grew peanuts on his demonstration farm. He consulted with\nCarver.^[38]\n\nIn 1916, Carver was made a member of the Royal Society of Arts in England, one\nof only a handful of Americans at that time to receive this honor. Carver's\npromotion of peanuts gained him the most notice.\n\nBy 1920, the U.S. peanut farmers were being undercut by low prices on imported\npeanuts from the Republic of China.^[39] In 1921, peanut farmers and industry\nrepresentatives planned to appear at Congressional hearings to ask for a\ntariff.^[40] Based on the quality of Carver's presentation at their\nconvention, they asked the African-American professor to testify on the tariff\nissue before the Ways and Means Committee of the United States House of\nRepresentatives.^[40] Due to segregation, it was highly unusual for an African\nAmerican to appear as an expert witness, but Carver appeared and unpacked\nnumerous exhibits and samples to make his case for greater food and industrial\nuses for the peanut.^[40] Southern congressmen mocked him, but as he talked\nabout the importance of the peanut and its uses for American agriculture and\nmanufacturing, committee members repeatedly extended the time for his\ntestimony.^[41] The Fordney\u2013McCumber Tariff was enacted in 1922, and included\na duty on imported peanuts.^[42] Carver's testimony, including samples of\npeanut milk, peanut flour, industrial dyes made from peanuts, and other\npeanut-based products, made him widely known as a public figure.^[42]\n\n## Life while famous\n\nA United States Farm Security Administration portrait, March 1942A peanut\nspecimen collected by Carver\n\nDuring the last two decades of his life, Carver seemed to enjoy his celebrity\nstatus. He was often on the road promoting Tuskegee University, peanuts, sweet\npotatoes, and racial harmony. Although he only published six agricultural\nbulletins after 1922, he published articles in peanut industry journals and\nwrote a syndicated newspaper column, \"Professor Carver's Advice\". Business\nleaders came to seek his help, and he often responded with free advice. Three\nAmerican presidents\u2014Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge and Franklin\nRoosevelt\u2014met with him, and the Crown Prince of Sweden studied with him for\nthree weeks. From 1923 to 1933, Carver toured white Southern colleges for the\nCommission on Interracial Cooperation.^[36]\n\nWith his increasing notability, Carver became the subject of biographies and\narticles. Raleigh H. Merritt contacted him for his biography published in\n1929. Merritt wrote:\n\n> At present not a great deal has been done to utilize Dr. Carver's\n> discoveries commercially. He says that he is merely scratching the surface\n> of scientific investigations of the possibilities of the peanut and other\n> Southern products.^[43]\n\nIn 1932, the writer James Saxon Childers wrote that Carver and his peanut\nproducts were almost solely responsible for the rise in U.S. peanut production\nafter the boll weevil devastated the American cotton crop beginning about\n1892. His article, \"A Boy Who Was Traded for a Horse\" (1932), in The American\nMagazine, and its 1937 reprint in Reader's Digest, contributed to this myth\nabout Carver's influence. Other popular media tended to exaggerate Carver's\nimpact on the peanut industry.^[44]\n\nFrom 1933 to 1935, Carver worked to develop peanut oil massages to treat\ninfantile paralysis (polio).^[36] Ultimately, researchers found that the\nmassages, not the peanut oil, provided the benefits of maintaining some\nmobility to paralyzed limbs.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1937, Carver participated in the USDA Disease Survey. Carver had\nspecialized in plant diseases and mycology for his master's degree.\n\nIn 1937, Carver attended two chemurgy conferences, an emerging field in the\n1930s, during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, concerned with\ndeveloping new products from crops.^[36] He was invited by Henry Ford to speak\nat the conference held in Dearborn, Michigan, and they developed a friendship.\nThat year Carver's health declined, and Ford later installed an elevator at\nthe Tuskegee dormitory where Carver lived, so that the elderly man would not\nhave to climb stairs.^[5]^[45]\n\nCarver had been frugal in his life, and in his seventies he established a\nlegacy by creating a museum of his work, as well as the George Washington\nCarver Foundation at Tuskegee in 1938 to continue agricultural research. He\ndonated nearly US$60,000 (equivalent to $1,298,723 in 2023) in his savings to\ncreate the foundation.^[45]\n\nCarver headed the modern organic movement in the southern agricultural\nsystem.^[46] Carver's background for his interest in organic farming sprouted\nfrom his father being killed during the Civil War, and when his mother was\nkidnapped by Confederate slave raiders. Now an orphan, Carver found comfort in\nbotany when he was just 11 years old in Kansas. Carver learned about herbal\nmedicine, natural pesticides, and natural fertilizers that yielded plentiful\ncrops from his caretaker. When crops and house plants were dying, he would use\nhis knowledge and go and nurse them back to health. As a teenager, he was\ntermed the \"plant doctor\".\n\nWhen his study about infection in soybean reached Booker T. Washington, he\ninvited him to come and teach at the Tuskegee Agricultural school.\n\nAlthough the emancipation allowed Black families 40 acres and a mule,\nPresident Johnson revoked this and gave the land to white plantation owners\ninstead. This prompted Black farmers to exchange what was once their land, and\nin turn, a small part of the land's harvest. This led to sharecropping.^[47]\nCarver soon realized that farmers were not obtaining enough food to survive,\nand how the industrialization of cotton had contaminated the soil.^[48]\n\nCarver wanted to find a way to organically transform Alabama's failing soil.\nHe found that alternating nitrogen-rich crops would let the soil get back to\nits natural state. Keeping crops like sweet potatoes, peanuts, and cowpeas\nwould produce more food surplus and different types of food for farmers.\nCarver worked to pioneer organic fertilizers like swamp muck and compost for\nthe farmers to use. These fertilizers were more sustainable to the planet and\nhelped farmers to spend less money on fertilizers since they were recycling\nproducts.^[48]\n\nCarver pushed for woodland preservation, to help improve the quality of the\ntopsoil. He urged farmers to feed their hogs acorns. The acorns contained\nnatural pesticides and feeding them acorns was cheaper for the farms too.^[49]\nCarver's efforts towards the holistic and organic approach are still in\npractice today. In his research, Carver discovered Permaculture. Permaculture\ncould be used to produce carbon from the atmosphere, produce a higher quantity\nof crops, and let crops flourish despite global warming.\n\n## Relationships\n\n\"Austin Curtis \u2013 Scientist successor to Dr. Carver\", cartoon by C. H. Alston\n\nCarver never married. At age 40, he began a courtship with Sarah L. Hunt, an\nelementary school teacher and the sister-in-law of Warren Logan, Treasurer of\nTuskegee Institute. This lasted three years until she took a teaching job in\nCalifornia.^[50] In her 2015 biography, Christina Vella reviews his\nrelationships and suggests that Carver was bisexual and constrained by mores\nof his historic period.^[51]\n\nWhen he was 70, Carver established a friendship and research partnership with\nthe scientist Austin W. Curtis Jr. This young black man, a graduate of Cornell\nUniversity, had some teaching experience before coming to Tuskegee. Carver\nbequeathed to Curtis his royalties from an authorized 1943 biography by\nRackham Holt.^[52] After Carver died in 1943, Curtis was fired from Tuskegee\nInstitute. He left Alabama and resettled in Detroit. There he manufactured and\nsold peanut-based personal care products.^[53]\n\n## Death\n\nUpon returning home one day, Carver suffered a bad fall down a flight of\nstairs; he was found unconscious by a maid who took him to a hospital. Carver\ndied January 5, 1943, at the age of 78 or 79 from complications (anemia)\nresulting from this fall.^[54] His death came when he was sitting up in bed\nwhile painting a Christmas card which said, \u201cPeace on earth and goodwill to\nall men.\u201d Carver biographer Prema Ramakrishnan said of him that \"His death was\ncharacteristic of him and his entire life\u2019s work.\"^[55]^[56] He was buried\nnext to Booker T. Washington at Tuskegee University. Due to his frugality,\nCarver's life savings totaled $60,000, all of which he donated in his last\nyears and at his death to the Carver Museum and to the George Washington\nCarver Foundation.^[57]\n\nOn his grave was written, \"He could have added fortune to fame, but caring for\nneither, he found happiness and honor in being helpful to the world.\"^[58]\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Christianity\n\nCarver believed he could have faith both in God and science and integrated\nthem into his life. He testified on many occasions that his faith in Jesus was\nthe only mechanism by which he could effectively pursue and perform the art of\nscience.^[59] Carver became a Christian when he was still a young boy, as he\nwrote in connection to his conversion in 1931:^[60]\n\n> I was just a mere boy when converted, hardly ten years old. There isn't much\n> of a story to it. God just came into my heart one afternoon while I was\n> alone in the 'loft' of our big barn while I was shelling corn to carry to\n> the mill to be ground into meal.\n>\n> A dear little white boy, one of our neighbors, about my age came by one\n> Saturday morning, and in talking and playing he told me he was going to\n> Sunday school tomorrow morning. I was eager to know what a Sunday school\n> was. He said they sang hymns and prayed. I asked him what prayer was and\n> what they said. I do not remember what he said; only remember that as soon\n> as he left I climbed up into the 'loft,' knelt down by the barrel of corn\n> and prayed as best I could. I do not remember what I said. I only recall\n> that I felt so good that I prayed several times before I quit.\n>\n> My brother and myself were the only colored children in that neighborhood\n> and of course, we could not go to church or Sunday school, or school of any\n> kind.\n>\n> That was my simple conversion, and I have tried to keep the faith.\n>\n> \u2014 G. W. Carver; Letter to Isabelle Coleman; July 24, 1931\n\nHe was not expected to live past his 21st birthday due to failing health. He\nlived well past the age of 21, and his belief deepened as a result.^[35]\nThroughout his career, he always found friendship with other Christians. He\nrelied on them especially when criticized by the scientific community and\nmedia regarding his research methodology.^[61]\n\nCarver viewed faith in Jesus Christ as a means of destroying both barriers of\nracial disharmony and social stratification.^[62] He was as concerned with his\nstudents' character development as he was with their intellectual development.\nHe compiled a list of \"eight cardinal virtues\" whose possession defines \"a\nlady or a gentleman\":\n\nA monument to Carver at the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis\n\n>   * Be clean both inside and out.\n>   * Who neither looks up to the rich nor down on the poor.\n>   * Who loses, if needs be, without squealing.\n>   * Who wins without bragging.\n>   * Who is always considerate of women, children and old people.\n>   * Who is too brave to lie.\n>   * Who is too generous to cheat.\n>   * Who take his share of the world and lets other people have theirs.^[63]\n>\n\nBeginning in 1906 at Tuskegee, Carver led a Bible class on Sundays for several\nstudents at their request. He regularly portrayed stories by acting them\nout.^[64]\n\n### Voice pitch\n\nEven as an adult Carver spoke with a high pitch. Historian Linda O. McMurry\nnoted that he \"was a frail and sickly child\" who suffered \"from a severe case\nof whooping cough and frequent bouts of what was called croup\".^[65] McMurry\ncontested the diagnosis of croup, holding rather that \"His stunted growth and\napparently impaired vocal cords suggest instead tubercular or pneumococcal\ninfection. Frequent infections of that nature could have caused the growth of\npolyps on the larynx and may have resulted from a gamma globulin deficiency.\n... until his death the high pitch of his voice startled all who met him, and\nhe suffered from frequent chest congestion and loss of voice.\"^[65]\n\n## Honors\n\nA painting by Betsy Graves Reyneau\n\n  * 1923, Spingarn Medal from the NAACP, awarded annually for outstanding achievement.^[36]\n  * 1928, honorary doctorate from Simpson College\n  * 1939, the Roosevelt Medal for Outstanding Contribution to Southern Agriculture\n  * 1940, Carver established the George Washington Carver Foundation at the Tuskegee Institute.\n  * 1941, The George Washington Carver Museum was dedicated at the Tuskegee Institute.\n  * 1942, Ford built a replica of Carver's birth cabin at the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Dearborn as a tribute.\n  * 1942, Ford dedicated a laboratory in Dearborn named after Carver.\n  * 1943, Liberty ship SS George Washington Carver launched\n  * 1947, George Washington Carver Area High School, named in his honor is opened by the Chicago Public Schools in the Riverdale/Far South Side area of Chicago, Illinois, United States.\n  * 1950, George Washington Carver State Park named\n  * 1951\u20131954, U.S. Mint features Carver on a 50 cents silver commemorative coin\n  * 1965, Ballistic missile submarine USS George Washington Carver (SSBN-656) launched.\n  * 1969, Iowa State University constructs Carver Hall in honor of Carver\u2014a graduate of the university.^[66]\n  * 1943?, the US Congress designated January 5, the anniversary of his death, as George Washington Carver Recognition Day.^[67]^[68]\n  * 1999, USDA names a portion of its Beltsville, Maryland, campus the George Washington Carver Center.^[69]\n  * 2002, Iowa Award, the state's highest citizen award.^[70]\n  * 2004, George Washington Carver Bridge, Des Moines, Iowa\n  * 2007, the Missouri Botanical Gardens has a garden area named in his honor, with a commemorative statue and material about his work\n  * 2022, Gov.

Guba in 1961.^[78]\n\n## Legacy\n\nIn 1948 the U.S. Government released a commemorative stamp issued on Carver's\nbirthday, five years after his death.A 1951 Carver-Washington commemorative\nhalf dollarCarver is featured on the reverse of Missouri's 2024 American\nInnovation dollar\n\nA movement to establish a U.S. national monument to Carver began before his\ndeath. Because of World War II, such non-war expenditures had been banned by\npresidential order. Missouri senator Harry S. Truman sponsored a bill in favor\nof a monument. In a committee hearing on the bill, one supporter said:\n\n> The bill is not simply a momentary pause on the part of busy men engaged in\n> the conduct of the war, to do honor to one of the truly great Americans of\n> this country, but it is in essence a blow against the Axis, it is in essence\n> a war measure in the sense that it will further unleash and release the\n> energies of roughly 15,000,000 Negro people in this country for full support\n> of our war effort.^[36]\n\nThe bill passed unanimously in both houses.\n\nOn July 14, 1943,^[79] President Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicated $30,000\n(~$422,592 in 2023) for the George Washington Carver National Monument west-\nsouthwest of Diamond, Missouri, the area where Carver had spent time in his\nchildhood. This was the first national monument dedicated to an African\nAmerican and the first to honor someone other than a president. The 210-acre\n(0.8 km^2) national monument complex includes a bust of Carver, a 3\u20444-mile\nnature trail, a museum, the 1881 Moses Carver house, and the Carver cemetery.\nThe national monument opened in July 1953.\n\nIn December 1947, a fire broke out in the Carver Museum, and much of the\ncollection was unfortunately damaged. Time magazine reported that all but 3 of\nthe 48 Carver paintings at the museum were destroyed. His best-known painting,\ndisplayed at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, depicts a\nyucca and cactus. This canvas survived and has undergone conservation. It is\ndisplayed together with several of his other paintings.^[80] Carver was\nfeatured on U.S. 1948 commemorative stamps. From 1951 to 1954, he was depicted\non the commemorative Carver-Washington half dollar coin along with Booker T.\nWashington. A second stamp honoring Carver, of face value 32\u00a2, was issued on\nFebruary 3, 1998, as part of the Celebrate the Century stamp sheet series. Two\nships, the Liberty ship SS George Washington Carver and the nuclear submarine\nUSS George Washington Carver (SSBN-656), were named in his honor.\n\nIn 1977, Carver was elected to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans. In 1990,\nhe was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1994, Iowa State\nUniversity awarded Carver a Doctor of Humane Letters. In 2000, Carver was a\ncharter inductee in the USDA Hall of Heroes as the \"Father of Chemurgy\".^[81]\n\nIn 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed George Washington Carver as one of\n100 Greatest African Americans.^[82]\n\nIn 2005, Carver's research at the Tuskegee Institute was designated a National\nHistoric Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society.^[83] On February\n15, 2005, an episode of Modern Marvels included scenes from within Iowa State\nUniversity's Food Sciences Building and about Carver's work. In 2005, the\nMissouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis, Missouri, opened a George Washington\nCarver garden in his honor, which includes a life-size statue of him.\n\nMany institutions continue to honor George Washington Carver. Dozens of\nelementary schools and high schools are named after him. National Basketball\nAssociation star David Robinson and his wife, Valerie, founded an academy\nnamed after Carver; it opened on September 17, 2001, in San Antonio,\nTexas.^[64] The Carver Community Cultural Center, a historic center located in\nSan Antonio, is named for him.\n\n## Reputed inventions\n\nCarver has been given credit in popular folklore for many inventions that did\nnot come out of his lab. Three patents (one for cosmetics; US 1522176, issued\nJanuary 6, 1925 , and two for paints and stains; US 1541478, issued June 9,\n1925 , and US 1632365, issued June 14, 1927 ) were issued to Carver in 1925 to\n1927; however, they were not commercially successful.^[84]\n\nAside from these patents and some recipes for food, Carver left no records of\nformulae or procedures for making his products. He did not keep a laboratory\nnotebook. Mackintosh notes that, \"Carver did not explicitly claim that he had\npersonally discovered all the peanut attributes and uses he cited, but he said\nnothing to prevent his audiences from drawing the inference.\"^[85]\n\nCarver's research was intended to produce replacements from common crops for\ncommercial products, which were generally beyond the budget of the small one-\nhorse farmer. A misconception grew that his research on products for\nsubsistence farmers were developed by others commercially to change Southern\nagriculture.^[86]^[87] Carver's work to provide small farmers with resources\nfor more independence from the cash economy foreshadowed the \"appropriate\ntechnology\" work of E. F. Schumacher.\n\n### Peanut products\n\nDennis Keeney, director of the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at\nIowa State University, wrote in the Leopold Letter (newsletter):\n\n> Carver worked on improving soils, growing crops with low inputs, and using\n> species that fixed nitrogen (hence, the work on the cowpea and the peanut).\n> Carver wrote in 'The Need of Scientific Agriculture in the South': \"The\n> virgin fertility of our soils and the vast amount of unskilled labor have\n> been more of a curse than a blessing to agriculture. This exhaustive system\n> for cultivation, the destruction of forest, the rapid and almost constant\n> decomposition of organic matter, have made our agricultural problem one\n> requiring more brains than of the North, East or West.^[88]\n\nCarver worked for years to create a company to market his products. The most\nimportant was the Carver Penol Company, which sold a mixture of creosote and\npeanuts as a patent medicine for respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis.\nSales were lackluster and the product was ineffective according to the Food\nand Drug Administration.^[89] Other ventures were The Carver Products Company\nand the Carvoline Company. Carvoline Antiseptic Hair Dressing was a mix of\npeanut oil and lanolin. Carvoline Rubbing Oil was a peanut oil for massages.\n\nCarver is often mistakenly credited with the invention of peanut butter.^[90]\nBy the time Carver published \"How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing\nit For Human Consumption\" in 1916,^[91] many methods of preparation of peanut\nbutter had been developed or patented by various pharmacists, doctors and food\nscientists working in the US and Canada.^[92]^[93]^[94] The Aztecs were known\nto have made peanut butter from ground peanuts as early as the 15th century.\nCanadian pharmacist Marcellus Gilmore Edson was awarded U.S. patent 306,727\n(for its manufacture) in 1884, 12 years before Carver began his work at\nTuskegee.^[95]^[96]\n\n### Sweet potato products\n\nCarver is also associated with developing sweet potato products. In his 1922\nsweet potato bulletin, Carver listed a few dozen recipes, \"many of which I\nhave copied verbatim from Bulletin No. 129, U. S. Department of\nAgriculture\".^[97] Carver's records included the following sweet potato\nproducts: 73 dyes, 17 wood fillers, 14 candies, 5 library pastes, 5 breakfast\nfoods, 4 starches, 4 flours, and 3 molasses.^[98] He also had listings for\nvinegars, dry coffee and instant coffee, candy, after-dinner mints, orange\ndrops, and lemon drops.\n\n## Carver bulletins\n\nDuring his more than four decades at Tuskegee, Carver's official published\nwork consisted mainly of 44 practical bulletins for farmers.^[99] His first\nbulletin in 1898 was on feeding acorns to farm animals. His final bulletin in\n1943 was about the peanut. He also published six bulletins on sweet potatoes,\nfive on cotton, and four on cowpeas. Some other individual bulletins dealt\nwith alfalfa, wild plum, tomato, ornamental plants, corn, poultry, dairying,\nhogs, preserving meats in hot weather, and nature study in schools.\n\nHis most popular bulletin, How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it\nfor Human Consumption, was first published in 1916^[100] and has been\nreprinted numerous times. It provides a short overview of peanut crop\nproduction and contains a list of recipes from other agricultural bulletins,\ncookbooks, magazines, and newspapers, such as the Peerless Cookbook, Good\nHousekeeping, and Berry's Fruit Recipes. While Carver's was not the first\nAmerican agricultural bulletin devoted to\npeanuts,^[101]^[102]^[103]^[104]^[105] his bulletins seem to have been more\npopular and widespread than those that preceded his.\n\nThe standard author abbreviation Carver is used to indicate this person as the\nauthor when citing a botanical name.^[106]\n\n## See also\n\n  * United States portal\n  * Biography portal\n  * Science portal\n\n  * African-American history\n  * Carver College\n  * Carver Academy, Texas\n  * Carver Court, a historic housing development in Chester County, Pennsylvania\n  * George Washington Carver Center for Arts and Technology, a public high school in Towson, Maryland\n  * Carver High School (disambiguation)\n  * Carver Junior College, Cocoa, Florida, closed in 1963\n  * Carver Middle School (disambiguation)\n  * List of people on stamps of the United States\n\n## Citations\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b \"About GWC: A Tour of His Life\".
