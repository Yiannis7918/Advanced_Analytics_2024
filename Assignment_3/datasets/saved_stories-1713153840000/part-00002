The result will be shown further below.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### How the Integral Calculator Works\n\nFor those with a technical background, the following section explains how the\nIntegral Calculator works.\n\nFirst, a parser analyzes the mathematical function. It transforms it into a\nform that is better understandable by a computer, namely a tree (see figure\nbelow). In doing this, the Integral Calculator has to respect the order of\noperations. A specialty in mathematical expressions is that the multiplication\nsign can be left out sometimes, for example we write \"5x\" instead of \"5*x\".\nThe Integral Calculator has to detect these cases and insert the\nmultiplication sign.\n\nThe parser is implemented in JavaScript, based on the Shunting-yard algorithm,\nand can run directly in the browser. This allows for quick feedback while\ntyping by transforming the tree into LaTeX code. MathJax takes care of\ndisplaying it in the browser.\n\nWhen the \"Go!\" button is clicked, the Integral Calculator sends the\nmathematical function and the settings (variable of integration and\nintegration bounds) to the server, where it is analyzed again. This time, the\nfunction gets transformed into a form that can be understood by the computer\nalgebra system Maxima.\n\nMaxima takes care of actually computing the integral of the mathematical\nfunction. Maxima's output is transformed to LaTeX again and is then presented\nto the user. The antiderivative is computed using the Risch algorithm, which\nis hard to understand for humans. That's why showing the steps of calculation\nis very challenging for integrals.\n\nIn order to show the steps, the calculator applies the same integration\ntechniques that a human would apply. The program that does this has been\ndeveloped over several years and is written in Maxima's own programming\nlanguage. It consists of more than 17000 lines of code. When the integrand\nmatches a known form, it applies fixed rules to solve the integral (e. g.\npartial fraction decomposition for rational functions, trigonometric\nsubstitution for integrands involving the square roots of a quadratic\npolynomial or integration by parts for products of certain functions).\nOtherwise, it tries different substitutions and transformations until either\nthe integral is solved, time runs out or there is nothing left to try. The\ncalculator lacks the mathematical intuition that is very useful for finding an\nantiderivative, but on the other hand it can try a large number of\npossibilities within a short amount of time. The step by step antiderivatives\nare often much shorter and more elegant than those found by Maxima.\n\nThe \"Check answer\" feature has to solve the difficult task of determining\nwhether two mathematical expressions are equivalent. Their difference is\ncomputed and simplified as far as possible using Maxima. For example, this\ninvolves writing trigonometric/hyperbolic functions in their exponential\nforms. If it can be shown that the difference simplifies to zero, the task is\nsolved. Otherwise, a probabilistic algorithm is applied that evaluates and\ncompares both functions at randomly chosen places. In the case of\nantiderivatives, the entire procedure is repeated with each function's\nderivative, since antiderivatives are allowed to differ by a constant.\n\nThe interactive function graphs are computed in the browser and displayed\nwithin a canvas element (HTML5). For each function to be graphed, the\ncalculator creates a JavaScript function, which is then evaluated in small\nsteps in order to draw the graph. While graphing, singularities (e. g. poles)\nare detected and treated specially. The gesture control is implemented using\nHammer.js.\n\nIf you have any questions or ideas for improvements to the Integral\nCalculator, don't hesitate to write me an e-mail.\n\n\u00a9 David Scherfgen 2024 \u2014 all rights reserved.\n\nContact and Privacy\n\nCookie settings\n\nEnter your function here.
