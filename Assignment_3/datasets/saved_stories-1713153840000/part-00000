The company operated from the\nmid 1970's into the mid 1980's, delivering approximately 1000 computers to\ncustomers in Texas, Oklahoma, and others. The computers were used for\naccounting and other business functions in medium sized companies.\n\nThe Centurion was made of almost entirely TTL MSI logic on a handful of PC\nboards in a single rack. Earlier models relied on magnetic core memory, later\nmodels used MOS memory up to 256 kB. It was technologically similar to the DEC\nPDP 11 or Data General Nova, but smaller and lower priced. Competition from\nlower cost microcomputers, particularly the IBM XT and AT in the 1980's, led\nto decreased sales and the end of the line.\n\n# Additional Information\n\nThe large majority of the information presented here has been discovered\nthrough the help of an amazing team of retired Centurion employees and\nbrilliant enthusiasts working together on the Discord chat server.
