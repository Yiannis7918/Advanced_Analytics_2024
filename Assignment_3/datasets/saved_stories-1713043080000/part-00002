For various\nreasons, many founders who have raised venture capital want to get off the VC\ntrain. They have said something to the effect of the following:\n\nI want to get off the VC train - what do I do?\n\nTo be clear, I am talking about founders I know who have previously convinced\nthemselves and some investors that they are building a company that fits the\nventure capital model; these companies have already been funded and are aware\nof how venture capital works and the expectations that come with the money\nthey\u2019ve raised. This is not a conversation I\u2019m having with bootstrapped\nfounders or people who tried and failed to raise venture capital; the founders\nI\u2019m talking about are very much in the VC-funded company ecosystem and are\naware of how it works. I\u2019ve been trying very hard to listen to what these\nfounders are saying and what motivates them to get off the train. After being\na part of many of these conversations, I can summarize what they mean in\nfairly simple terms:\n\nFor these founders, \u201cgetting off the train\u201d means decoupling the company\u2019s\nsuccess from the need to raise future rounds of venture capital and no longer\nmeasuring their success by the ability to continue to fundraise to fuel\ngrowth.\n\nGiven how the fundraising markets have changed in the last few years, I\nunderstand the desire to get off the train. The venture capital market in 2020\nand 2021 was one of the most open markets I\u2019ve seen in my career, and many\n(but by no means all) talented founders had access to capital on founder-\nfriendly terms. We then went through a period in late 2021 and most of 2022\nwhere access to capital was extremely limited for almost all companies unless\nyou had supportive existing investors. In 2023, the markets have felt\nselectively open to companies building in AI, companies that are leaders in\ntheir category, or otherwise building something unique and interesting to VC\ninvestors. For the average company, the last 12-24 months have been a very\nchallenging fundraising environment. And, as far as I can tell, very few\npeople are in a position to confidently state what the venture funding market\nwill look like in 2024, and I have no predictions to share on that front.\n\nGiven the recent volatility in the venture funding environment, I understand\nfounders' hesitation about staying on the VC train. To do so means you're\nputting the future viability of your company at risk based on what the\npreferences and interests of venture capitalists will be 12 to 24 months from\ntoday. This can be scary whether you\u2019re in a category that\u2019s currently in\nfavor and might lose its luster or if you\u2019re in a category that\u2019s currently\nout of favor and might later be in favor. It\u2019s hard to predict where the\nmarket will be and what investors will value. But where the markets are when\nyou need to raise money is a risk that comes with relying on venture capital\nto fund the next phase of your business.\n\nI approach most of these conversations with founders with a simple question -\nis getting off the train a choice, an option, or a necessity given the state\nof the business. There are some businesses that require meaningful investment\nin the early days to eventually build a big business in the end - many of\nthose businesses need venture dollars to fund growth, so getting off the train\nisn\u2019t really an option for them. For many other businesses, though, venture\ncapital can accelerate growth beyond what the company can achieve without it,\nand it\u2019s worth considering that funding as an option. I think most businesses\nI meet can be broadly grouped into four categories once you know something\nabout how the business actually works once it\u2019s live and you have data:\n\nAll businesses exist on a spectrum and this 2x2 just reduces the complexity of\nthe real world into something easier to generalize. I think the answer to\nwhether to get off the train really depends on the kind of company you have.\nIf you have a business that is no longer a fit for the venture model and\ndoesn\u2019t have near-term prospects for good unit economics, you have to get off\nthe venture train and figure out if the business you\u2019re working on is viable.\nIf you have a business that has really good unit economics, can get\nprofitable, and grow, you might want to seriously consider getting off the\ntrain. This is particularly true if you are in a category where investors do\nnot have a lot of enthusiasm for your category. Taking your own destiny into\nyour own hands might be the right answer for you. My big takeaway from having\nhad many of these conversations that the choice to stay on the train really\nrequires evidence or a belief that you\u2019re pursuing an opportunity that really\nfits the kind of outcomes that VCs want to see. If you\u2019re not in one of the\nrightmost quadrants in the chart above, I would question whether it makes\nsense for you to stay on the VC train and rely on venture funding for your\nfuture financing needs.\n\nThe other thing I\u2019ve started to ask founders is their reason for wanting to\nget off the train. In the end, I really want to know what\u2019s pushing them in\nthis direction. I find most answers fall into one of three buckets:\n\n  * Clear recognition that the original thesis was wrong - After working on the problem and talking to customers, there isn\u2019t a venture-scale business to be build based on the original thesis or any subsequent pivots. I find that these conversations are more about whether to keep going or shut down as opposed to staying on the venture treadmill.\n\n  * Fear of the unknown - Based on the fundraising environment I described above, many founders I know are afraid to risk the fate of their companies on the future state of the fundraising market and the uncertain bar to clear for the next round. While they think they have businesses that should be interesting to VCs, the chance that funding won\u2019t be available in the future is pushing them toward thinking about getting off the train. I generally think that operating from a place of fear is not a great way to run a company, but I also can\u2019t argue with the costs facing those who get the future fundraising market wrong. But sometimes just acknowledging that a decision is being motivated by fear creates more space to think about whether it is in fact the right decision to make\n\n  * Desire to control the company\u2019s destiny - I\u2019ve certainly talked to a handful of founders who just want to take reliance on outside funding off the table and control their own destiny. They want to cut the cord and find other ways to fund the business and they believe they can get to a good outcome without raising any more money.\n\nI suspect that I will be part of many more of these conversations in the\ncoming quarters and I think all founders should think about what makes sense\ngiven what they know about their businesses today and what they think the\nfuture holds.\n\n### Subscribe to Venture Reflections\n\nBy Charles Hudson \u00b7 Launched 5 years ago\n\nI mostly write about my reflections on the startup and venture capital\necosystems.\n\n55 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n55\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Getting Off the VC Train\n\nchudson.substack.com\n\n6\n\nShare\n\n6 Comments\n\nCharles MichaelCharles' NewsletterDec 15, 2023Liked by Charles HudsonVery well\narticulated article. Thank you for writing. Do you think this has come from\nVCs changing their narrative from \"grow, grow, grow\" to \"growth, margin, and\nburn\" for existing companies?It seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy. The\nexpectations some VCs are sharing with founders they invested in are more\naligned with how boostrapped companies operate. At the end of the day, it's\ndifficult to build a business to build a business versus building a business\nto fundraise.Expand full commentLike (3)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n2 replies\n\nDavid DaneshDec 15, 2023Liked by Charles HudsonGreat article, Charles!
