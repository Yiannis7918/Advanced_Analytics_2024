I\nthink its safe to say we\u2019ve all been there, and it\u2019s tempting to jump right\nin. But what if I told you there\u2019s immense value in simply sitting on an idea?\n\nLet\u2019s explore this concept. Sometimes, the excitement of a new idea can cloud\nour judgment. It feels like the idea is burning a hole in our pocket, urging\nus to act. However, taking some time to marinate on it can reveal insights\nthat aren\u2019t apparent at first glance.\n\nI\u2019ve started practicing this approach myself. Whenever I come up with a\npotential improvement or even think about rewriting some part of a system, I\nwrite it down. I sketch out what it might look like, both from a design and a\ncommunication standpoint. Then, I let it sit. Sometimes for a week, other\ntimes for a month. During this period, I might gather some initial feedback to\nget a sense of direction but nothing more.\n\nAfter some time, I revisit the idea. To my surprise, majority of the time, the\nideas don\u2019t make sense anymore, or they\u2019ve evolved into something more\nsubstantial. Looking back, if I had rushed into action, I\u2019m not sure how\nsuccessful those attempts would have been.\n\nThis practice is about more than just avoiding mistakes. It\u2019s about ensuring\nthat our actions are as effective as possible and truly necessary. It\u2019s\napplicable whether you\u2019re developing a product, handling incident responses,\nor planning long-term projects.\n\nSo, why does sitting on an idea work so well? I think it gives us the chance\nto overcome our initial biases and see the idea from new angles. With time, we\ncan assess its relevance, urgency, and applicability. Sometimes, doing nothing\nfor a while is the best course of action.\n\nNext time you\u2019re itching to jump on a new idea, consider letting it sit for a\nwhile. You might find that the idea improves, or you might discover a\ndifferent path that makes even more sense.\n\nHave you ever sat on an idea and found that it evolved for the better? How did\nthe wait impact your decision-making process?\n\nlast modified April 13, 2024\n\n\u00a9 2024 Shayon Mukherjee\n\n", "frontpage": false}
