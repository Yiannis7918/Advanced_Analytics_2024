If you are able, we strongly\nencourage you to listen to the audio, which includes emphasis that\u2019s not on\nthe page\n\n## Intro\n\nAdam: Welcome to CoRecursive. I\u2019m Adam Gordon Bell. How do you build the most\nsuccessful video game? Like the one that, that tops the charts, that captures\na moment, that leads to a franchise, that changes gaming. One key is you gotta\ncatch a rising star at just the right moment.\n\nMick: We signed Tony Hawk, he was shown a demo of the game. And he liked it.\nAnd then luckily after that, he was in the X Games and he landed the first 900\ntrick, which is like, you\u2019re doing two and a half spins.\n\nAnd that was like the holy grail of skateboarding tricks.\n\nIt\u2019s like the best moment ever in skateboarding history. And just before the\ngame was going to go to the duplicators. And so it really like, it was this\nextra big boost for us. And we had to get the 900 in the game.\n\nAdam: That\u2019s Mick West, and yeah, he was the lead programmer on Tony Hawk Pro\nSkater. You know the game, the one where I, I know all the songs, where people\nmy age probably played it obsessively at some point? Well today we\u2019re diving\ninto the story behind its creation.\n\nBut you know what bothers me? Is stories that start there, right? With, and\nthen We signed Tony Hawk or, and then we had her IPO because I always think to\nmyself, like, well, what happened before that, right? How did you get to that\npoint? So that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking to Mick about. We\u2019re tracing his path from\nfresh college grad to successful industry veteran.\n\nAnd along the way there, there\u2019s lots of passion projects. There\u2019s lucky\nbreaks, but yeah. Mick mastered game design and scheduling and managing teams.\nAnd most importantly, nailing the fun game mechanics that separate a mega hit\nfrom just another game. So let\u2019s trace that decades long path, right? Mick has\nyears of dedication where he kept leveling up his skills.\n\nHe collaborated with other people. And yeah, there was technical hurdles to\novercome. There was crunch times that they had to power through. Their focus\nwas on creating games they loved. Right. It\u2019s a, it\u2019s a journey built, not\nnecessarily on dedication, but sort of on passion, pouring yourself in to\nprojects, embracing the growth, surrounding yourself with like minded people\nand just doing it right.\n\nBecause behind every iconic game, there\u2019s an extraordinary career. And a\ncareer tale worth exploring. So that\u2019s today. It\u2019s a bit about the nuts and\nbolts of game creation, but also really, it\u2019s about, you know, how do you\ncraft an extraordinary career in your field and whatever field that might be.\n\nSo let\u2019s start at the beginning, right? For Mick, this journey started in\n1989. When he finished college and he landed his first job at a game company.\n\n## First Game Company\n\nMick: so I just applied to one and went to the interview. And the guy just\nasked me these really basic questions like, how do you draw a line and things\nlike that.\n\nAdam: Of course, Mick knew how to draw a line on a screen. He\u2019d been building\nlittle games and drawing things on screens of computers since he was a kid.\nAnd so this company \u2013 which is called Binary Designs \u2013 they hired him.\n\nMick: It\u2019s in a place called Victoria Building, I think, which was part of the\ntrain station in Manchester. It was this really old office building, down\nbelow us there was a kebab shop on the lower floor and above us there was like\na phone sex hotline where people would like, dial in and pay 50p a minute to\nhave some woman talk to them.\n\nAnd it was really old. It was like you\u2019re living in some, some building from\nthe Edwardian times. You had these giant high ceilings and peeling paint from\nthe walls. Looked like something out of a movie. And then we were all just\ncrammed into these, these giant rooms with these high ceilings on the, and we\nall had like, um, two computers on our desk.\n\nAdam: Two computers would be two Amigas, or maybe two Atari STs. These were\nboth far more powerful than the Spectrum that Mick had grown up on. Mick\u2019s\nfirst game targeted the Amiga, so they set him up with two Amigas jammed on\nhis desk.\n\nMick: You\u2019d write the code on one of them and it would have a floppy disk\ndrive. And so you\u2019d write the code, edit something, then you\u2019d like to\ncompile, save it to the floppy, take it out, stick it in the other one, reboot\nthe other computer, let it load up the program, see if your change works.\n\nIt was very laborious process\n\n## Steve Davis World Snooker\n\nAdam: The game was called Steve Davis World Snooker.\n\nMick: Steve Davis was a , famous snooker player back in the day. Looks a bit\nlike Ken Jennings with ginger hair. But yeah, so we had to do , this snooker\ngame. And I remember , the guy who was working on it at the start didn\u2019t know\nany trigonometry at all. Which was a real downside when you\u2019re programming a\nsnooker game.\n\nAnd so, they hired me and I go in there and immediately start changing all of\nhis code because he, he was doing it in a most ridiculous way where he had I\nthink like 32 entry lookup table. And so if it was like, if it was coming from\ndirection 17 and the velocity is less than this, then go in direction too.\n\nAnd it would\u2019ve been the worst snooker game ever.\n\nAdam: Once the game was finished, Mick\u2019s latest disc was shipped off to the\nduplicators, who made copies of this disc, boxed it up, and released it.\nRemember, this is before Steam and app stores. The game actually hit store\nshelves. You know, a floppy disk in a box waiting to be picked up by gamers.\n\nMick: That was an awesome feeling. Seeing my very first game on the shelf. And\nthen not only that, but like seeing it being reviewed in magazines. And people\nwere writing about things that I\u2019d done, and they would put the programmer\u2019s\nname in the reviews as well because, back then it was these small teams, so\nit\u2019s like, programmers by, you know, there was three people, I think, working\non it\n\nAdam: Was the review good?\n\nMick: Yeah, it was, it was pretty good. Uh, I mean the game itself wasn\u2019t\namazing.\n\nYou could have done a good 3D snooker game, pool game on the Atari ST back\nthen But we did this this top down thing So you just see the balls moving\naround the screen and the the pool cues like that Bouncing off the cushions\nand that\u2019s how snooker games had always been done up until that point.\n\nPeople didn\u2019t mind they liked it and it was it was still kind of fun to play.\nSo it got good reviews and it sold reasonably well, I think.\n\n## Rotox & Bankruptcy\n\nAdam: Mick\u2019s next project was Rotox, a tank arcade game with a twist. And the\ntwist was the player stayed centered in the screen while the world moved\naround it as sort of a top down view, like Contra 3 that I played as a kid.\n\nMick: And this was like this amazing thing at the time. It was the most\nincredible thing that no one had ever seen before. Like the whole thing\nrotates. Because everyone\u2019s used to like, space invaders and things where\neverything\u2019s very static.\n\nThey, they, they really gave us very little instruction.\n\nThey said right this is what we\u2019re going to do We\u2019re going to build the game\nthat\u2019s going to be this and you go for it And they didn\u2019t really, you know,\ngive you very much in the way of instructions And this this happened quite\nconsistently\n\nThere was like the boss who owned the company and he was in another building\nand he only came around every like week or so.\n\nAnd so you, You were kind of left on your own to work on it for a while. So I\ndidn\u2019t really know what I was doing. And I spent all this time writing an\neditor to edit these levels and everything got really like behind schedule.\n\nAdam: Part of the problem was there wasn\u2019t really any milestones. They\nexpected a 20 year old, fresh out of school to hit an arbitrary schedule that\nthey had made up, right? No questions asked. Honestly, with that type of\nfreedom, I could have easily wasted several months at the beginning of the\nproject. But for Mick, the work was fun, and he liked the artist he worked\nwith, and with few other commitments, you know, he was young, time flew by\nuntil the deadline was getting close and the game was almost finished.\n\nThen one day they walked into the office and they noticed something was\ndifferent.\n\nMick: And we see that our Atari STs have been replaced by VIC 20s. Like\nCommodore VIC 20s, which is this really much, much crappier, older computer.\nAnd we had no idea what was going on, and we just stood around for a while,\nand eventually, like, someone came in and said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m the official\nreceiver for this company, which has entered bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nAnd, uh, we\u2019re going to go and have an interview with all of you and, uh, see\nhow much backpay you\u2019re owed. And then you\u2019re off.\n\n## Backrupcy Shennagians\n\nAdam: Right before the bankruptcy, the boss had swapped out all the computers\nfor older machines. The good dev machines all landed, surprise, surprise, in a\nnew gaming company. It started by the same guy.\n\nAnd he took the old game that I was working on, he took Rotox. And that was\nreleased by the new company, even though I\u2019d been working on it on the old\ncompany. And it really should have been, I guess, part of the assets of the\nold company.\n\nMick: This is all, 30 years ago now or so. Hopefully, hopefully it\u2019s not going\nto get prosecuted because of my revelations about the VIC 20s.\n\nAdam: The bankruptcy receiver told Mick he actually had a bunch of back pay.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t been taking any vacation because he was trying to meet his deadline.\nAnd so he had a couple of weeks where he could do his job search. The Binary\nDesigns team, they just regrouped at a local pub and started brainstorming\nstrategies for finding their next jobs.\n\nMick: So we kind of formed together into groups and we\u2019ve said like, \u201cYou, me\nand, uh, and Larry, we\u2019ll go to this other company and we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll try and\nget a job there as a team because we\u2019ll stay together as a team.\u201d So I go\nthere with, with these, these two other guys and we get to the interview of\nthis next company and then they say, \u201cWell, yeah, Mick, we\u2019re, we want you,\nbut we don\u2019t want Larry.\u201d\n\nSo I was like, \u201cOkay, well, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll, that\u2019s fine. Sorry, Larry.\u201d I think\nLarry eventually went into insurance or something like that.\n\n## UN Squadron\n\nAdam: The next company was called Tiertex and they did a lot of conversions\nfrom arcade games to home computers. Mick joined and was asked to work on a\ngame called UN Squadron.\n\nMick: Which is where people from the United Nations are invading a foreign\ncountry for some reason. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some, some good reason why the\nUnited Nations was killing all these people, but, uh, probably rescuing the\ngood people from the bad people.\n\nBut basically you\u2019re flying a plane, side scrolling, shooting up type thing.\n\nAdam: So did they like buy an arcade machine for it and\n\nMick: Yeah, they, they had, um, they had an arcade cabinet and the boards back\nthen were kind of standard.\n\nI can\u2019t remember what it was called. It\u2019s called a jammer or something like\nthat. Standard type of thing.\n\nMe and one artist were working on this game. They would send you a board.\nWhich had the game on it and then you, you\u2019re on your own for, for a year\ntrying to, trying to do this,\n\nAdam: Nowadays, if you were doing an arcade conversion, you\u2019d get all the\nassets from the company. All the artwork, maybe all the code, anything that\ncould help you.\n\nMick: But this, they didn\u2019t give us anything at all. They didn\u2019t tell us\nanything at all about the game. Like, how it worked, or anything. There\u2019s\nzero. So we had, the artist had to recreate all of their artwork from scratch.\nAnd so the artist just starts working on getting through that list of stuff\nand then getting it to me I have to work on fitting it into the game, which\nmeans because you\u2019ve got to be fitting within the available memory so I\u2019ve got\nto figure out, you know, what format it is and how to do a, how to store the\nmaps, the side scrolling maps, because, uh, you couldn\u2019t just draw all the\ngraphics and just scroll a giant picture.\n\nYou have to break it down into individual tiles, and then you do a tile map,\nand then you scroll this tile map.\n\nAdam: Figuring out the tile map was the tricky part for the artist, because\nthey had nothing besides the arcade games, right? They had no assets, they had\nno code. The only way to figure things out was to play through the game.\n\nMick: So, like, for the first, uh, I don\u2019t know, like two or three weeks.\n\nAll I was doing was playing this game through from the start to the end over\nand over again getting better and better at it so I could figure out exactly\nwhat\u2019s going on videoing myself doing it but also studying things like you\nknow when does this guy come in and if I you know, if I fly in at a different\nangle, will they trigger it from a different thing?\n\nAnd how did these missiles work? There\u2019s homing missiles. So I\u2019d have to like\nfly around the screen and try to figure out what the algorithm was for these,\nthese homing missiles\n\nAdam: Playthroughs were videotaped, and the artist used these recordings to\nliterally trace assets directly from the screen.\n\nMick: Often with actual paper on the screen. Tracing over that and then,\nthere\u2019s a little grid. And then redoing it in these pixel art programs.\nBecause, you know, everything was like just pixel art back then. It wasn\u2019t 3D\nat all. You had to just like do individual pixels.\n\nAnd then I\u2019ve got to recreate it myself in code. And back then we were coding\nin Motorola, 68, 000 assembly language\n\nAnd you had to fit it all in 512k or half a megabyte of RAM, which wasn\u2019t very\nmuch, and on one floppy disk. But it was actually kind of fun, I enjoyed doing\nthat. It was fun playing the game and it was fun replicating that experience,\non the Amiga, or the Atari ST.\n\nAnd so we just basically just plowed through it, just getting everything in\nfrom the arcade game into this conversion and trying to get it all done. I\nthink we had to get it done by Christmas, this particular one. So. And that\nbecame a recurring theme, games getting released by Christmas.\n\nAdam: Ah, that\u2019s when parents are out buying games for their kids?\n\nMick: Indeed, yes, yes. And, yeah, people have a bit of spare spending money\nas well. If they get given money, they go out and buy a video game. Yeah, that\nwas a big, a big sales time. And, yeah, that was always, throughout my career,\nwas everything was organized around the holidays,\n\nAdam: This was sort of the feel of the game industry back then. A programmer\nand artist worked side by side, like literally Mick could reach out and touch\nhim, crafting a game from scratch, and racing against the calendar year to hit\na launch date in Christmas. And then you kind of repeat this annually. Mick\u2019d\nwork with an artist named James, and they\u2019d hit the pub for lunch each day and\ngossip about the various local game companies.\n\nMick: And the pub at the time had this, this deal, where you would get free\npizza if you bought a beer.\n\nSo we\u2019d always go to the pub at lunchtime, have a beer, usually two, and eat\npizza and then plot our, our departure.\n\nWe can kind of see that the stuff that was going on at, at Tiertex, they were\njust doing like these arcade conversions and kind of low quality stuff. And I\nthink we\u2019d heard of other people moving to Ocean and getting paid more and\ngetting paid royalties for their games and getting paid bonuses. And it just\nseemed like if you go to Ocean, you\u2019re going to get a lot more money,\nbasically. Yeah, for doing similar work, similar type of fun work. They were\nan actual publisher, whereas Tiertex was working for a publisher. So you\ndidn\u2019t get the same kind of direct involvement.\n\nAdam: If you aren\u2019t up on the games industry, like I\u2019m certainly not, I\u2019m\nactually not a big gamer, know that game developers create games under\ncontract from publishers. The publishers handle all the marketing and the\ndistribution and the promotion. They\u2019re the ones who get the games into\nstores, and they\u2019re the ones that reap the profits from sales.\n\nAnd that profiting from the sale of the game, that was what excited Mick and\nJames. And it was a hot topic during their lunchtime chats over pizza and\nbeer. Sometimes I feel like talking shop gets a bad rap, right? Discussing\nwho\u2019s working where, what it\u2019s like at different companies. People can look\ndown upon that.\n\nBut as you\u2019ll see, industry talks, gossip, like this, they\u2019re a key to Mick\u2019s\ncareer. Grabbing a beer or coffee with the right folks can occasionally take\nyour career to the next level. So because it sounded exciting, James and Mick\ndecided to go to Ocean for a job interview, and Ocean was on board. They both\nsecured positions to start after they finished their current game.\n\nMick: And unfortunately, someone overheard us plotting and then they reported\nit to the management.\n\nAnd I was figuring I was going to leave after, after I did this, uh, this\nAtari ST version, but then said, Nope, you have to stay and do the Amiga\nversion.\n\nI was like, Hmm, no, I think I\u2019ll just leave. And then they were like, Nope,\nyou have to stay. Everybody knows everybody within the games industry. So they\ncalled their friends over at Ocean and Ocean says, Yes, Mickey, you\u2019re going\nto have to stay and finish this. So I knocked it out in like two weeks so I\ncould go and start working at Ocean.\n\n## Ocean\n\nAdam: And so Mick got the start on his new job at Ocean. It was a real game\npublisher. One that started years ago with mail order games, but now was doing\na lot of exclusive games for large U. S. movie franchises, like big\nblockbuster movies. Ocean was a major player, but their offices didn\u2019t give\nthat impression.\n\nMick: Well, the Ocean Office was even worse than the Binary Design Office, uh,\nin that it was, it was a crypt. It was an old Quaker\u2019s meeting hall, and I\nthink they cleaned out the bodies from the crypt. And so we were in these,\nthese like, arched things. If you stood up, uh, the one side of the room, you\nbang your head on these, these stone arches, which are probably like 300 years\nold or something.\n\nAnd it, we were, we were crammed in. It was like two people again, working\ntogether, you and an artist. So there\u2019s me and an artist. Then there\u2019s like a\nkind of a partition in the middle of this arched crypt. And then two people on\nthe other side. Another guy and an artist and then some, some testers were\nacross the, the hallway and this really low arch thing, and they were all kind\nof like huddled over, like underneath this stone archway where they\u2019re playing\non the computers.\n\nAdam: At Ocean, the development environments got better. Mick had a PC and an\nAtari, and they were connected via a parallel cable, so instead of swapping\ndisks back and forth, you could sync code directly to the Atari. The project\nthat Mick got assigned was turning the new Liam Neeson movie, Darkman, into a\ngame.\n\nMick: Just this pretty, uh, kind of schlocky, horror, Frankenstein, Invisible\nMan type thing, where the guy gets badly burned and has to wear masks to solve\ncrimes.\n\nAnd we had to do a game version of that. We went down to London, I remember\nthat was kind of fun. We went to London to the studio, I mean, it wasn\u2019t the\nstudio, it\u2019s like, because it was an American film, but it was in London. They\nhad like the, whoever the distributors were, had a little, one of those\ncinemas, like a screening room.\n\nWe got to see it in the screening room and I was like, wow, this is awesome.\nLike, you know, I\u2019m in Hollywood.\n\nAdam: Mick and the artists had to find a way to incorporate elements of the\nmovie into the game. And in the movie, Darkman takes pictures of people and\nthen recreates masks based on the photos.\n\nMick: And so there was a section in the game where there were these windows\nand people would occasionally walk past the window and you\u2019d have to like,\nclick on them with a pen cursor and take a picture of them and then if you\ntook enough pictures it would give you a disguise and the disguise would give\nyou some like invincibility for a few minutes where the bad guys wouldn\u2019t\nrecognize you until it wore off and so you have to do these almost like nods\nto what\u2019s happening in the movie, but really it\u2019s just a game where you jump\non platforms and you shoot at things and then you throw bombs and press\nswitches and solve puzzles.\n\nIt\u2019s really nothing to do with the actual game, but stylistically you have\nsome similar elements from the movie. But yeah, it was quite remarkable how\nlittle direction we were given, like, you know, we, we gave the game to the\ntesters and they would test things and give us bugs. But, you know, the game\ndesign was, was all up to me.\n\nI was just like some kid out of college who knew how to code. And they relied\nupon me to make a, a fun game. And it, it wasn\u2019t, wasn\u2019t that great.\n\n## Long Hours\n\nAdam: Even though the game wasn\u2019t original, there was still work to be done.\nAnd without clear milestones or oversight, the workload could be inconsistent\nat times.\n\nMick: And so, you know, you\u2019re left on your own, la dee dah, for several\nmonths, and then all of a sudden, like, it has to be done in three weeks. And\nI\u2019m like, what? And there\u2019s all this, there\u2019s 500 bugs that you need to fix.\nAnd so you end up having to stay a long time. And sometimes like late into the\nevening, there was one occasion when I actually got locked into the offices\nbecause I was there so late.\n\nUh, so I was the last person to leave and the door didn\u2019t have any, like, fire\nescape exit or anything like that. It was locked from the outside essentially\nwith a big old key. This old building and so there was no way of getting out\nonce you\u2019re inside. So I was trapped inside this building if there had been a\nfire I might have died. But yeah, so I was stuck inside there and I could hear\npeople in the church upstairs. And I\u2019ve tried like knocking on the walls,\ntrying to get their attention, but I didn\u2019t get any attention.\n\nAdam: So Mick gets out of the office in the nick of time. Yeah, he gets the\ngame ready in time for launch.\n\nThe Lethal Weapon game for the Sega Genesis was shipped as planned. Because,\nat Ocean and at all the places Mick worked, there was an unwritten law. The\ngame has to hit the deadline, it has to get out for Christmas, no matter what.\n\n## Parasol Stars\n\nAdam: So next, Mick dove into his next project, converting this lesser known\ngame that was called Parasol Stars. In it, you catch raindrops with parasols,\nbasically umbrellas. Mick\u2019s favorites because it was fun to play. But\nunfortunately, the conversion process had some challenges.\n\nMick: So they didn\u2019t give us any code, they didn\u2019t tell us how anything worked\nor, anything about the secrets of how things were supposed to pop up when they\ndid. So again, I had to play through the game all the way from the start to\nthe finish. So I got very, very good at playing Parasol Stars.\n\nAnd basically learning exactly what all the algorithms were by just looking at\nwhat happens on the screen and trying to figure it out. That was one of the\nfirst games where I started writing custom tools for it. Because we got given\nall the graphics, but on the PC Engine, each individual sprite on screen can\nhave its own 16 colors. So you had a total of like 2, 000 colors possible, but\neach sprite could have its own palette of 16 colors, which, which was great.\nBut unfortunately on the, uh, the Atari ST, it only had 16 colors total for\nthe entire thing. So we had to come up with a palette of just 16 colors and\nthen map all these like 2, 000 colors to this, this, this, uh, this much more\nreduced palette.\n\nAdam: During this time, Mick also continued to refine a skill to him\nthroughout his entire career. His ability to reverse engineer an existing\ngame.\n\nMick: which meant for each level you\u2019d pause the game as it started, and then\nyou\u2019d see where is everything, and then you\u2019d, you\u2019d edit, I wrote a little\neditor to edit the start positions of everything on screen, then you\u2019d play\nit, and you\u2019d see how do these things move, and where do they go, where do\nthese things drop, where these little things pop up, What kind of magic makes\nthese things happen, because you sometimes get special bonuses and things like\nthat, we couldn\u2019t figure out the algorithms that they use, and we asked them,\nwe asked the Japanese company, never heard anything back, so we had to\nbasically invent our own best guesses as to why things were happening.\n\nUh, in the code based on what we saw on the screen, but it worked out really,\nreally well. That was one of the best games I did of that period. It\u2019s an\narcade conversion, but it was very, very accurate to the, to the game as it\nwas on the original PC engine. So I was extremely happy with that that\nparticular game.\n\nAdam: Like, why does it stand out?\n\nMick: It was a fun game to play. It was it was like the UN squadron really\nwasn\u2019t that great of a game. The Parasol Stars game was much better in that it\nwas more true to the actual original and things that, things moved relatively\nfast.\n\nBut it worked out really well, and I was very happy with the way, like, the\nend result was to play, because it felt very much like the original game.\n\nAnd it looked pretty much like the original game, especially the Amiga\nversion.\n\nAdam: And did it, it was released to, to Fanfare\n\nMick: Yeah, no, it was. People loved it. It was, it was very nice we didn\u2019t\ndesign the game, we just did the conversion of it because it was a very good\noriginal game. People loved it because the conversion was so accurate and,\nvery, very playable with the, the different controls.\n\nSo, it, it was very well received, I think.\n\n## California\n\nAdam: The game was a hit, right, thanks in part to the great conversion, but\nreally the gameplay was what stole the show. Meanwhile, you know, Mick\ncontinued to make friends and talk to people in the gaming industry in the UK\nand Manchester. And then some of these people that he knew, they started to go\nto California.\n\nMick: And, you know, I kind of, eventually, yeah, saw, What was happening and\none of my friends, uh, Mike Lamb, he moved to the United States and he worked\non, I think, uh, Mike Tyson\u2019s Knockout or something like that, a Mike Tyson\nboxing game, which is incredibly big selling game at the time.\n\nAnd he was making like, thousands or tens of thousands of pounds in, in\nroyalties. And I was like, I gotta get me some of that. And so, you know, at\nthe time I\u2019d just broken up with my girlfriend, didn\u2019t have anything keeping\nme in the, in the, in the U. S. So I thought. Time for my next great\nadventure. I\u2019m just going to go, go to the United States. So I remember I\nfaxed over my, uh, my resume to the guy and, uh, he was like, come on over.\nMike says you\u2019re, you\u2019re a good guy and that\u2019s good enough for me. So, the,\nthe salary was, was like at least twice as much as I was making in, in the UK.\nSo that was a great thing.\n\nI mean, and we were promised royalties as well, so it was like no brainer\nreally.\n\n## Malibu\n\nAdam: Moving to the States was going to be great, right? Mick thinking about\nit while he packed. He\u2019s thinking, you know, I\u2019m going to be working on this\nMechWarrior game. Going to be making twice as much money. I\u2019m going to be in\nMalibu. It\u2019s an exciting time, but things didn\u2019t quite work out as expected.\n\nMick: didn\u2019t realize that Malibu was actually, uh, not exactly where the\noffices were. It was just called Malibu Interactive.\n\nIt was actually in, in the San Fernando Valley, which was over on the other\nside of the Santa Monica mountains. And it was quite a trek to get to the\nocean at lunchtime. So, but it was still, you know, it\u2019s America. It was, uh,\na novel experience for me.\n\n## Starting Neversoft\n\nMick: I think after the, after this first game, this MechWarrior game, I had\nnothing to do. So I\u2019ve been left to my own devices. There wasn\u2019t a new game\nfor me to work on.\n\nSo I started writing a Doom clone.\n\nSo I did that . And I think um, Joel came in one day and he said, How long did\nthat take you?\n\nAdam: Joel was an accountant at Malibu Interactive.\n\nMick: And I was like, no, like about a week. And he was like, hmm. And he\ncomes back like the next, uh, next week and he was like, so Mick, like I\u2019m\nthinking, you know, let\u2019s, let\u2019s go to the pub And he told me that he was\nthinking of starting up a company and, uh, wanted me to, to do it and he had\nlike some contacts already, and I suggested we bring another guy, Chris Ward,\nI was living with him at the time. We were sharing an apartment. And so I said\nlike, me and Chris, you, we\u2019ll start this company. So that\u2019s what happened.\nUh, we started Neversoft.\n\nAdam: How does that work? Like,\n\nyou get an accountant, and a programmer, and\n\nMick: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s that\u2019s what happened. That\u2019s what happened. So yeah,\nyou get an accountant and a programmer and an artist. The accountant\nnegotiates the deal. You don\u2019t need an accountant, but it\u2019s very good to have\none as it turned out. So Joel has been talking to people at Playmates\nInteractive.\n\nAdam: Playmate Interactive was on board.\n\nThey offered 10, 000 a month for three months, and then there was a milestone\nat the end. Right, they\u2019d evaluate the game and if they wanted to greenlight\nit and keep paying the 10, 000 a month or just cancel it. That deal was the\nticket out of Malibu for the three of them.\n\nBut then at that point, even staying in the U. S. became a hurdle\n\nMick: we were on visas, like temporary work visas. So we had to get new visas\nvia this new company to stay. But if the money had run out, I would have been\ndeported. I would have had to leave the country if I couldn\u2019t find another\njob. Because, you know, it\u2019s tied to a particular company.\n\nSo we had to jump through all these hoops with immigration. Get an immigration\nattorney and, get the things transferred over. Uh, but yeah, so we started\nworking on this, this game and, you know, again, like, I wasn\u2019t, there was no\none, there was no game designer, so it was me doing the game design again.\n\nSo I\u2019m getting a bit better at this stage at doing game design, having been\nforced to do it, uh, for all these years, even though I\u2019m really just a\nprogrammer. So I, I do this, this game design document that I wrote up for\nthem and they\u2019re like, yeah, that sounds good. And then we started, uh, we\nstarted the company\n\n## Neversoft Office\n\nAdam: The first game was a success, and it spared Mick and his roommate from\nbeing deported. And, you know, this secured their toehold in the industry. And\nthey even had an office. Now they, they set up shop in an office across from a\nbowling alley in Woodland Hills.\n\nMick: Which turned out to be fortunate because it tied in with our Tony Hawk\u2019s\nPro Skater game, which comes a bit later in the story.\n\nBut But yeah, so we sat in an office, there\u2019s no internet back then. Yeah, I\nmean, I was, I was, Jack of all trades back then, because, you know, back when\nit was just me, there was no one else to do anything, so I had to do things\nlike build the computers, fix them if they went wrong like, and manage the\nnetwork and when we eventually got servers, like, I had to do the server\nmanagement and rebuild, uh, that when it went wrong, and do all the backups\nand things like that, and a lot of stuff that wasn\u2019t just programming, it was,\nuh, you know, the type of stuff you would have an IT department do.\n\ndo nowadays. But back then, operations were so small, you got to do\neverything.\n\nAdam: So yeah, sure. Mick started out juggling all the tasks, but as Neversoft\nfound success, they were able to expand the team and grow more people, and for\nthis group of guys in their 20s, the Neversoft office turned into more than\njust a place to work.\n\nMick: we would often like hang out in the office in the evening, either just\ndoing work or just playing stuff. And we would do all kinds of just stupid,\nlike, kids stuff. Like we\u2019d build forts and we\u2019d play, we\u2019d do jugg we\u2019d have\njuggling contests and we\u2019d, we\u2019d play.\n\nthrow things around. I had a a stiff like a, it\u2019s like a bow staff, like a\nfive foot staff made out of red oak. Because I was like, you know, everyone\nfancies themselves to be some kind of ninja when they\u2019re a young man. And we\nwould play with that. And I think it ended up like, like getting stuck in the\nceiling at some point because I threw it and it bounced off a box and like\nricocheted up into the ceiling and Joel banned it.\n\nJoel had to be like the dad in that situation because he was like, I don\u2019t\nknow, maybe four, he\u2019s like four years older than us, I think, which at the\ntime seemed like he was an old, old dude, like four or five years older. He\nwas practically in his thirties. But yeah, he got to be the dad. Uh, so he\nwould he would tell people off if they got into fights and things, which did\nactually happen occasionally.\n\nand he confiscated my stick. He made me take my stick home, which was probably\na good idea. I probably would have broken a window or something at some point.\n\n## Scheduling\n\nAdam: Joel was the CEO and he kind of had to play the heavy. So he tried to\nminimize the playful chaos at the office, but Mick was an owner as well. And\nas their games grew more complicated, as it was no longer just, you know, one\nprogrammer and one artist, there was some changes that were needed.\n\nMick: And Joel was always encouraging me to Make a schedule. I was quite\nresistant to it at first. I was like, no, this is how it works This is how\nwe\u2019ve always done it and joel was more and more insistent.\n\nI mean from joel\u2019s perspective He\u2019s the accountant. He\u2019s the ceo at this point\nbecause we\u2019re starting to get more because to get bigger after we do, uh, That\nthat game and so he\u2019s encouraging me to actually write a schedule and I think\nIt got quite quite heated at some point and I was like, yeah, it\u2019s just\nridiculous.\n\nI\u2019m not doing it and joel\u2019s like well You know We\u2019re gonna have to call it\nquits then. And then I kind of saw the error of my ways and I was like, well,\nokay, I\u2019ll write a schedule. And I wrote this very, very short schedule and\nyeah, we\u2019ve been fine tuning scheduling ever since.\n\nAdam: Their scheduling process worked well when they had a game to develop,\nwhen they had these clear targets that were set by the publisher, right? You\nhave to hit this deadline, you have to hit this milestone. But in the LULs,\nwhen they didn\u2019t have a game on the horizon, it was tougher. They\u2019d kind of\nbuild prototypes and try to shop them around publishers and try to get some\nnew business going.\n\nMick: We did all kinds of prototypes of games. We did a prototype rally racing\ngame, and kind of a, Futuristic racing game.\n\nWe did a Tiger Woods game thinking this Tiger Woods guy looks like he might be\npopular one day, let\u2019s say. He was, he was already quite popular by then, but\nnowhere near what he actually became. Uh, so we pitched a Tiger Woods game. No\none, no one bought it, a bass fishing game.\n\n## Enter Sony\n\nMick:\u00ab!\u2013(31:59)\u2013> and then we, we were working on a MEC game, and I think, uh,\nSony eventually saw this Met game that we were working on, and, uh, thought\nthat it, uh, it was worth doing.\n\nAnd so they, they hired us to do this Met game called Big Guns. And then, you\nknow, Sony, big company, they kind of forced us to professionalize a little\nbit more, like started developing tools and using 3D Studio, that was a 3D\nediting program back then, to edit the levels in and kind of make things, the\nprocess a bit better.\n\nAnd it kind of helped, but unfortunately they also the game design in this\nreally boring direction, and the game itself got really boring and\ncomplicated, and, didn\u2019t really work and then they cancelled it because they,\nthe game that they started with was fun But again, they ended up with through\ntheir direction ended up not being very good\n\n## MDX Conversion\n\nAdam: so the big gun codebase just collected dust for a while. It\u2019s going to\ncome back up, just wait for it. But the next thing that happened is Neversoft\ndid a PC to console conversion. It\u2019s similar to the arcade conversions that\nMick had done back at Tiertex\n\nMick: the PCs back then, they had about 16 megabytes of RAM. And we\u2019re\nconverting it to to like the PlayStation, which had basically one and a half,\nI think.\n\nCompared to a 16 megabyte PC and the code\u2019s all written in, in C at this\npoint. So it\u2019s, it\u2019s getting quite complicated here. And the PC has floating\npoint. The PlayStation doesn\u2019t have floating point. It\u2019s everything\u2019s fixed\npoint arithmetic, which means that you can\u2019t have very high precision things.\n\nAnd if you do have high precision, it\u2019s really, really slow. So we had to do\nall these. Incredible hoops to jump through to actually get it to work on, on\nthe PlayStation\n\nAdam: The publisher promised a 40, 000 bonus if Neversoft could deliver the\ngame and pass QA in October. And it seemed like with their newly honed\nscheduling skills that this might just be doable.\n\nMick: And so we\u2019re like, well, we, we all meet that deadline and we did, we\nmet that deadline, but at, at what cost? Well, the cost of meeting the\ndeadline was that the game was just riddled with bugs.\n\nIt was just, we, we kind of like thought, oh, it\u2019s maybe it\u2019s okay. Yeah, but\nthen they took it to their test department and immediately they come back with\nlike 500 bugs. That we have to fix. And so the deadline is now gone. And now\nwe\u2019ve just got to try to finish it by Christmas. And so entered like the, the\nmost hellish period of programming in my life.\n\nWhen I was basically just fix one bug, another one appears,\n\nAdam: the big problem, of course, is that big games mainly sell at Christmas.\nIf you work for a year to hit a Christmas deadline and then you miss it, well,\nyou\u2019ve got a year until the next big sales season again. And a publisher who\u2019s\nfunding you and taking all this risk, if they miss that Christmas slot, that\u2019s\nputting them in a really bad place.\n\nIf you give a publisher a bad time like that, you can bet other publishers\nwill hear about it, and you might not get any games the next year.\n\nSo it was crunch time, and the bugs got worked through, and they put it on a\nCD, and they sent it off to Sony to retest, just in time, if everything played\nout right, to hit that Christmas release. But then, a critical crash bug was\nfound, the type that Sony won\u2019t let through.\n\n## Game Crash\n\nMick: one of the programmers on his in his own spare time had added an extra\ndifficulty level to the game\n\nYou\u2019d only get through after you\u2019ve played through the entire game once. he\ndid that and then they sent it to Sony and then they find a bug with this\nthing. Which was not authorized by the original publishers. So, we kind of got\nin trouble for that, because we weren\u2019t supposed to add things like that. And\nhe added this, this, this, the extra thing. And the game would just, it\nwouldn\u2019t crash. Like, after you finished this super hard difficulty level, it,\nit wouldn\u2019t crash.\n\nYou get a black screen, you press a button and he goes past it. And they\nfailed us for that.\n\nAdam: This is a big problem, right? Because it might be easy to fix this, just\nremove the level that\u2019s not even supposed to be there, but then there could be\nnew bugs introduced. Sony needs to restart the QA process with this new CD.\nWith this new version.\n\nMick: and we would have missed our ship date and we would have missed\nChristmas and the distribution deal would have been messed up and, hundreds of\nthousands of dollars would have gone up in smoke and no one will work with us\never again,\n\nwe, we called, like, the head of, of, of Sony Games and we basically begged\nhim, Please let us, let us, uh, pass this thing. And then they, they said,\nwell, you know, you press a button and get past it, I guess it\u2019s okay.\n\nAnd so we shipped in time for Christmas, which, which saved us, I think.\n\nAdam: Because it worked out, Neversoft was able to get more work from\npublishers. Activision, at the time, was struggling with this game called\nApocalypse. They had spent six months with some other dev shop, but it wasn\u2019t\nworking out. And so Neversoft was asked to step in. The game had started with\nthis motion capture version of Bruce Willis, and it wasn\u2019t really clear how to\nturn it into a fun game.\n\nBut Neversoft still had that big guns code base. This had sort of become the\nMO at Neversoft: recycle. You know, things from the previous game to build a\ngame engine for the new game\n\nAnd so they repurposed it. They inserted motion capture, Bruce Willis into the\ngameplay. They used that old code as their game engine, tweaking it to meet\nthe needs of the new game.\n\nMick: That worked out really well And knocked out this lovely little game in,\nin like seven months or so. In time for Christmas, saved Activision\u2019s bacon\nand made it seem to them like we were a great professional company.\n\n## SkateBoarding\n\nMick: And when that one finished, they said, well, we also were thinking of\ndoing a skateboarding game.\n\nActivision, kind of like their marketing department, had identified an\nunderserved niche. It\u2019s action sports. And they think, oh, we\u2019ll start the\nwhole action sports thing because the X Games was kind of big at the time.\n\nAnd skateboarding, Tony Hawk was starting to get well known. And so, they\nsaid, let\u2019s do a skateboarding game. And they didn\u2019t know how big it would\nbecome. They just thought it would be like a nice little earner, you know,\nthey could make some, some money doing a skateboarding game and maybe\nsomething would come from it.\n\nAnd we were like, sure, I guess, yeah. And across the road from us in the\nbowling alley, there was a, an arcade machine called Top Skater.\n\nAdam: Top Skater was all downhill, almost like a racing game, except you\u2019re\nracing down a giant halfpipe and, you know, doing tricks and collecting coins\nor rings or whatever.\n\nBut it was a fun game.\n\nMick: And so we thought, well, let\u2019s do a game like Top Skater. It\u2019ll be fun.\nWe\u2019ll do a fun little game. Yeah, because kind of the mindset we were in back\nthen is you do a game quickly, we do a fun little game. And so we started\nworking on a prototype for this.\n\nAnd we had deadlines, monthly deadlines. We had to do, uh, uh, uh, a three\nmonth green light period where we work on it for three months and then if it\nworked out They would sign us up for the full deal So we kind of did a game a\nbit like top skater going downhill\n\nAdam: For the prototype, they repurposed the code again from their previous\nproject, Apocalypse, turned it into a downhill skateboarding game. So they had\na digital Bruce Willis with an Apocalypse, uh, shotgun on his back and a\nskateboard on his feet, racing downhill and able to do tricks.\n\nDuring game testing, right, players did this small downhill test section, but\nat the bottom, instead of restarting, there was kind of an open area with a\nlittle half pipe, and instead of hitting restart, they\u2019d just hang out there\nfor 20 minutes, jump around, and try to figure out how to do the tricks.\n\nMick: and then so we changed the design focus of the game to be this, what you\nsee now in the Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater, where it\u2019s more level based, where\nyou\u2019re going around a level rather than just going constantly, constantly\ndownhill.\n\nAnd once you\u2019ve got, once you\u2019ve got like a good mechanic for a game,\nespecially if it\u2019s a novel mechanic, it\u2019s not that hard to write a fun game.\n\nBecause the actual playing the game itself is fun. Like going through half\npipes, doing over jump, grinding a rail, and jumping and getting near the\nrail. You know, these things are fun in themselves. And so making a game\naround things that are fun just to do in themselves, isn\u2019t that hard? So you\njust do, here, do these five fun things.\n\nAnd it becomes like a fun thing that\u2019s also a challenge. And so that\u2019s kind of\nhow the game grew. You know, you have lots of fun doing whatever you\u2019re doing,\nand with just challenges that are a bit more, more and more difficult\n\n## Game Production\n\nAdam: And so Activision Greenlit the game, which didn\u2019t have Tony Hawk\nattached to it yet, it was just called Skate internally at Neversoft.\n\nMick: So we had a full 12 months to work on it from like October to October.\nAnd we probably hired a couple more people. We were working fairly closely\nwith Activision at that point.\n\nThere\u2019s some of the guys from Activision ended up coming over and working with\nus. Scott Peace, who was one of the main producers on the game.\n\nAdam: So what, what\u2019s the role of a producer? Maybe you can explain that\n\nMick: That\u2019s a good question. A sore spot amongst producers. Producers\nbasically organize everything and they make sure everything happens.\n\nScott was also doing a lot of design and implementation of, of that stuff. So,\nyou know, it\u2019s like scheduling, like getting all the assets, making sure\neverything is, the programmers are working on the right thing, the designers\nare working on the right thing, making sure things are working, talking to the\npublishers about what they need, making sure that\u2019s communicated, going back\nand forth.\n\nAnd Scott did a lot of the game design, including the original stuff. He came\nup with some of the original configuration of the, uh, the controller. And he\ndid a lot of the tweaking of the controls and implementing of tricks and\nthings like that and then working with programmers to get features done\n\nAdam: Mick was the producer initially, but when Scott took over, he dove into\ngame design, and fine tuning the code for the controls. He focused on what\nbuttons did what, and how they made the game characters interact with the\nworld.\n\nMeanwhile, another challenge cropped up. The Neversoft team, they knew how to\nmake fun video games, but they didn\u2019t really know skateboarding culture.\nBesides what you could learn from a bowling alley skateboarding game. And\nthere wasn\u2019t really time to hang out at the local skate park taking notes,\n\nbut they found an interesting shortcut.\n\n## Skateboarding Video Culture\n\nMick: we kind of, designed the game around skate video culture, more than\nactual skateboarding culture. So within the game, you had to do things like\nhit, particular spots. And this is something in skate culture, there\u2019s\nparticular spots where you would go and do a particular trick and people would\nvideo you.\n\nAnd so the idea is that you would do a trick over this spot and then you get a\nlittle video replay of it. Or you would have to find videotapes. So actual\nvideotapes back in the day. People wouldn\u2019t even recognize what they are\nnowadays. But yeah, so, we watch a lot of these, these, these videos every\nlunchtime.\n\nWe watch a new Skate video and we see that\u2019s, that\u2019s what\u2019s cool. We\u2019ve got to\nget that in the game. Adam: The skate videos also showed the need for music in\ngames. Back then, licensing music for games was pretty new. So they\u2019d call up\nbands like Primus or Goldfinger that they saw in the skate videos and offer\nthem a small amount to use a track in the game. The bands, who were a bit\nclueless about licensing, you know, generally just said yes. And for them, it\nturned out to be a pretty good deal when the game hit shelves.\n\nMick: . It was very popular, uh, game, you know, we were college kids. And so\nwhen they go to a concert, everyone\u2019s heard your music because they\u2019ve all\nseen it on Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater.\n\nBut at some point we had to actually design the game. And I remember we did a\nbig design session where I stood in front, in the conference room, and then we\nhad these whiteboards all on the table on the wall, like four or five\nwhiteboards.\n\nAnd I was like, all right, let\u2019s design the school level. And so I drew a\nschoolhouse, like just a rectangle and said, like, we\u2019ll put some stairs down\nhere and we\u2019ll have a grind these rails and then we\u2019ll have a pool and we\u2019ll\nhave some walls. then we started coming up with the, the mini games type\nthings.\n\nLike we could do a skate where you have to collect the letters S K A T E. Or\nyou have to find the hidden tapes or you have to do this kind of a timed run\nwith so many points, or you have to hit all these points, or grind these\nrails, there\u2019s these challenges, and we were just people throwing out ideas,\nand I would like to write them down, or I would draw a little bit more on the\nboard, uh, and one of the artists, Silvio took the designs that I put on the\nwhiteboard and drew better versions of them, and those kind of became the\nblueprints.\n\nFor the, for the artists\n\nYeah, so we designed the whole game, I think over like three days. And we had\nbasically, these are the levels we\u2019re going to do, these are the types of\ngoals that we\u2019re going to do, and this is, let\u2019s, let\u2019s start working on it.\nAnd then we were just, we were just into it at that point.\n\n## The Demo Game\n\nAdam: At this point, the game was greenlit, they had a timeline, and\nActivision was busy sorting out the deal with Tony Hawk. And then Activision\ngot the idea that they should do a demo version of the game.\n\nMick: Pizza hut would include a free PlayStation demo disc with your pizza\nback then. And that\u2019s, uh, I think we. We shipped like a hundred thousand of\nthese demo discs and we got a lot of very positive feedback you know, it was\nkind of an encapsulation of the game.\n\nIt had like pools and ramps and rails and stuff like that. Just enough to have\nfun in. And it was like Like a one minute timer or maybe a 30 second timer.\n\nSo it was very limited to what you could actually do, but it was enough to\nhave fun because you could just restart it instantly. You could just like play\nit, have fun you know, your time would run out, you\u2019d go and try and do the\nsame thing. I\u2019m going to try and do whatever the trick was in this, this\nthing, have fun.\n\nAdam: People love the game. In the real world, learning to skateboard is hard,\nbut as this game got refined, it became pretty clear that playing this game\nwas just a lot of fun\n\nMick: And at the same time, we were also bringing people in to test the game.\nWe had like, Kids from a local high school coming in to, to test the game. And\nwe\u2019re getting lots of feedback from them about what was fun and what wasn\u2019t.\n\nAnd you were just watching them to see if they got frustrated at various\npoints. And, and so like, yeah, that then after that demo ship, then it\u2019s just\na case of finishing the game. So we were just trying to make the game as good\nas possible in the time available. And that\u2019s when our, our magical scheduling\ntechnique of, uh, rewriting the schedule every week, uh, was born.\n\ncame in. So we wouldn\u2019t have like a fixed schedule that we were going to stick\nby where every week we just like say, well, what\u2019s the schedule going to be\nnow? Because like we didn\u2019t meet our deadlines last week and you know, this\nisn\u2019t going to work. Can we add this? Well, yes, but then we\u2019d have to get rid\nof this.\n\nSo we had a very flexible deadlines other than we\u2019ve got to, we\u2019ve got to ship\na game. But, uh, yeah, we, we would basically revisit it every week to make\nsure that we were, we were always on target because every week we\u2019d have a\nnew, a new, a new schedule.\n\n## X-Games\n\nAdam: So, Activision signed Tony Hawk, and with the success of the Pizza Hut\ndemo, Activision was getting pretty pumped up about the possibilities for this\ngame. And as the game was getting close to be sent off to the duplicators, X\nGames 5 was on TV, featuring Tony Hawk.\n\nMick: and he landed the first 900 trick, which is like, you\u2019re doing two and a\nhalf spins. Is that right? Yes. Yes. Three 60 is one seven 20 is two, two and\na half is 900.\n\nAnd that was like the holy grail of skateboarding tricks. And it was this\nreally dramatic event where he was trying it and trying it and trying it and\neveryone was like cheering him on, the huge crowd, all the other skaters were\naround him going like, come on Tony, you can do it\n\nAdam: Tony had been wanting to do this trick for a decade. He had written it\non this list of tricks he wanted to get done. And this was a timed event, and\nmaking these various attempts at it, he ran out of time. But they just let him\ngo, they knew this was something special, and after ten attempts, he nailed\nit.\n\nAnd the crowd went wild, and he threw his skateboard into the crowd.\n\nMick: It\u2019s like the best moment ever in skateboarding history. And just before\nthe game was going to go to the duplicators. And so it really like, it was\nthis extra big boost for us. And we had to get the 900 in the game. The game\nwas like nearly done at that point, but we still, you know, had to get that\nin.\n\nSo we made that his special move, obviously because no one had done it before.\nHe couldn\u2019t put it in the game because no one could even do it. Not that that\nstops us bringing in ridiculous moves later, but, but yeah, it was, uh, it was\nreally helpful that we signed the right guy. Tony Hawk. And they signed him,\nsigned him, I think, to like a 20 year deal or something,\n\n## Tony Hawk 2\n\nAdam: So the first game went out, and Neversoft started working on the second.\nIt\u2019s easy to know what to include, because it was all the stuff that they had\nhad to cut due to scheduling in the first place, like a level designer.\n\nMick: And, uh, whilst we were doing this, the first game was selling\nincredibly well. It became number one bestseller, uh, and at the time, like,\nwe were, we could see the actual sales figures because, industry had this,\nthis, this thing where you could actually get, you could buy a spreadsheet of\nall the, the sales figures of games and you could see how yours compared to\nall the other ones and how much money they made, so we could see the sales\nfigures and we could see, like, how incredibly well it was doing and we could\nsee, like, things are going well and you know, we, we were getting royalties\nand bonuses from, from Activision for, for that, which was great.\n\nYeah. And so it became clear that Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater was going to be a big\nthing. And so we started focusing a little bit more on, on the second one.\n\nAdam: And so with the royalties coming in, and a successful franchise on their\nhands, the company started to change, and the company started to grow.\n\nMick: the role starts spreading out, like Instead of one programmer doing\neverything, now you\u2019ve got two programmers doing everything and then you\u2019ve\ngot like kind of programmers doing more niche things. Like you end up having a\nprogrammer who\u2019s just working on sound eventually and getting the sound\neffects working.\n\nAnd we\u2019d hire a sound guy who built a sound booth in his office. Soundproof\nbooth. And, you know, record the audio. voiceover and stuff like that.\n\nit\u2019s just kind of a gradual process of growing up and becoming more and more\nprofessional. We still did silly stuff though, like, go, go to the pub at\nlunchtime and have a few drinks and then come back and continue working. We\nstill have juggling contests.\n\nThe stick never made its way back to the office, unfortunately. I still have\nthat somewhere here. I think it\u2019s in my garage.\n\nYeah, the NSA was like a hundred people in the office and almost getting to\nthe stage where you didn\u2019t know the names of everybody cause you, you\u2019d be\nhiring new people and especially if they\u2019re artists, they\u2019d be working with\npeople not directly with you. Before it\u2019s like me and then there\u2019s my artists\nsat there close enough to touch and we just worked together for many, many\nmonths.\n\nBut in the, in the end state of Neversoft, it\u2019s more compartmentalized. It was\npeople in the other end of the building that you, you didn\u2019t even know their\nnames or what they were even working on. so it became, uh, a bigger. And\nslightly less personal endeavor\n\nAdam: Along the way, Neversoft was acquired by Activision. And although Mick\nstill loved the work, he was also just getting tired. And a condition of the\nacquisition was, Mick had to stay for at least four more years.\n\nMick: I wanted to branch out and do something different. And so I decided,\nlike, when my four years at Neversoft were up, I would just leave and do\nsomething else.\n\nAnd so I told Joel towards the end of, uh, the fourth year, and then started,\nlike, grooming my successors to, to take over after I left and then\neventually, like, told people I was leaving, and people were like, \u2018Oh no, we\ncan\u2019t do it without you, Mick!\u2019\n\nAnd of course they could, they were just fine. They were just fine without me.\nBut, you know, it was, it was kind of an emotional time leaving, because I\u2019d\nyou know, spent, maybe 10 years or so at Neversoft.\n\n## On Missing People\n\nAdam: So yeah, Mick left Neversoft. And although he doesn\u2019t regret it, because\nhe\u2019s done a lot of things since, sometimes when he thinks back on this passion\nfor gaming and programming and the friendships he built and the work with like\nminded devs, yeah, it can bring up some feelings.\n\nMick: Yeah, well, I guess the big thing I miss is working with people working\nwith other people directly, kind of, it\u2019s kind of fun in two ways, just like,\njust, Working with other people is fun socially. But it\u2019s also, you get this\nforce multiplier if you\u2019re working with other people. Is that you can do so\nmuch more if you have ten programmers than if it\u2019s just you by yourself.\n\nSo you can create bigger things. Like, I\u2019m working now by myself as a sole\nprogrammer on a single person project. It\u2019s open source, but no one\u2019s really\ncontributed much to it. So I\u2019m, I\u2019m doing it all by myself, but I keep\nthinking, ah, I want to do this new feature. If only I had like Ken, say, back\nfrom my, my, uh, Neversoft days.\n\nI could just say, Ken, like, do this. And like two weeks later it would be\ndone. But now I have to spend that two weeks, which means I can\u2019t do other\nthings. And I don\u2019t have a 10 programmers that can do all these different\nthings for me.\n\nAdam: So obviously, you know, Mythical Man month notwithstanding, a bigger\nteam can just get more stuff done. But for Mick, it\u2019s not just about the\nheadcount. It\u2019s also about, you know, people pouring their heart out into the\nwork.\n\n## The Passion To Create\n\nAdam: The people who really cared a lot, those are the people that Mick\nclicked with.\n\nMick: For me, the big takeaway from my experience is, is working with people\nwho are passionate about what they do and not people who are just like doing\nit because it\u2019s their job. Like people who actually enjoy doing it, people who\nenjoy coding\n\nI would stay up late at night sometimes programming something just because I\nthought it would be a fun, a fun feature.\n\nAnd one of the programmers, Paul, spent like three weeks trying to get shadows\non the, uh, the GameCube version of the game because he knew he could do it.\nHe was, he was, he had the, he had the fire in him to, to get these shadows\nworking. And unfortunately, It couldn\u2019t quite do it and it was a sad day when\nwe had to say \u201cPaul, you\u2019re going to have to work on finishing the game and\nnot on these shadows\u201d and he was like, \u201cbut I can do it\u201d and it\u2019s like no,\nsorry Paul you have to stop.\n\nBut yeah, he had that passion and that\u2019s that\u2019s really valuable.\n\nActually enjoying coding is, is a necessary thing. Like, obviously you could\nbe a good coder without actually enjoying it, but if you\u2019re not really, I\nthink, getting into the, the nitty gritty of it, if, and, and the deep\nunderstanding of the code.\n\nIf you\u2019re not actually doing it to the stage where you can enjoy it, where you\ncan actually like, write something and it works and you\u2019re like, yeah, or you\nfind a bug and you\u2019re like, that\u2019s what it was, that little bastard. That kind\nof passion for, for coding and for game development is something that\u2019s,\nthat\u2019s, I really enjoyed working with people who shared that passion.\n\n## Outro\n\nAdam: That was the show. But yeah, as I hinted at, Mick West\u2019s interesting\ncareer kept going.\n\nYou can catch him now, you know, talking about conspiracy theories, talking\nabout skeptical inquiry. You can find him on Twitter or YouTube or in\nScientific America or on Joe Rogan or in The Guardian. Everywhere.\n\nPlus, you know, he\u2019s channeling his passion into programming, into Site Rec,\nan open source project that he made that\u2019s dedicated to examining and\nrecreating UFO videos. It\u2019s pretty interesting stuff. But yeah, it\u2019s just\nanother way that Mick kind of shows me that his passion, his really going all\nin, is part of the secret of his success.\n\nRight now his passion is about fighting the spread of irrational beliefs. And\nyeah, if you want to learn more about Mick\u2019s actual game programming advice,\nhe wrote a lot of it down after leaving Neversoft. I put some links on the\npodcast page.\n\nBut yeah, the, for true fans, if you really want to support the podcast, go to\nCoRecursive.com/supporters, and, you\u2019ll get access to bonus episodes. And\nyou\u2019ll just show me that I should keep doing this. Last month, I made a kind\nof a behind the scenes peek that shows how I make episodes.\n\nAnd it was a look into how I do editing, and it was editing this particular\nepisode that you\u2019re listening to right now.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of work that I put into each episode. I think that if you were\nto ask somebody for, you know, Oh, what\u2019s the keys to a successful career, you\nknow, they might give you some platitudes, but if you get to hear their story,\nyou know, it, it\u2019s more vivid and it\u2019s more true and it\u2019s easier to apply to\nyour own circumstances, even if you have nothing, you know, to do with gaming,\neven if you\u2019re an accountant, I think that there are lessons you can take when\nyou get to hear the story.\n\nOkay. And so, yeah, I want to say thank you to all the supporters who, you\nknow, donate some monthly money on Patreon to me because they think this type\nof content is valuable.\n\nAnd until next time, supporter or not, thank you so much for listening.\n\nAbout CoRecursive\n\nA podcast about building software.\n\n  * Favorite Episodes\n  * Subscribe to Podcast\n  * Subscribe via Email\n  * Follow @CoRecursive on Twitter\n  * About\n\nLinks:\n\n  * CowBoy Programming\n  * Mick\u2019s Writing for Game Developers\n  * Mick\u2019s Game Credits\n  * siterec\n\nAbout Episode\n\n  * Release Date: 02 Apr, 2024\n  * Updated Date: 02 Apr, 2024\n  * Download Audio File\n  * Permalink\n  * RSS\n\nLeaving LinkedIn\n\nNAVIGATION\n\nHomeSubscribe To PodcastEpisodes By DateEpisode By ThemeAboutDonatePodcast\nRankings\n\nSOCIAL\n\nTwitter Linked in Instagram Slack\n\nLISTEN ON\n\nApple Podcasts Spotify Google Play Sticher Overcast\n\nCoRecursive\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2021\n\nEPISODES\n\nAudio Player\n\n00:00:00\n\n00:00\n\n57:00\n\n### Code, Kickflips and Crunch Time\n\n  * Podcasts List\n\n  * Code, Kickflips and Crunch Time Apr 02, 2024 57 min\n  * Leaving LinkedIn Mar 04, 2024 47 min\n  * Beautiful Code Feb 02, 2024 57 min\n  * Code as a Lifeline Jan 02, 2024 44 min\n  * From 486 to Vue.js Dec 04, 2023 46 min\n  * Platform Takes The Pain Nov 02, 2023 48 min\n  * Sloot Digital Coding System Oct 02, 2023 51 min\n  * Configuring Identity Sep 01, 2023 42 min\n  * The Science of Learning to Code Aug 02, 2023 50 min\n  * A Dark Room - From Code Hobo to Indie Game Developer Jul 03, 2023 40 min\n  * Quitting (And Then Rejoining) Stack Overflow Jun 02, 2023 53 min\n  * From Project Management to Data Compression Innovator May 02, 2023 59 min\n  * JSON vs XML Apr 03, 2023 49 min\n  * Sun's Mobile Blunders Mar 02, 2023 51 min\n  * Shipping Graphing Calculator Feb 02, 2023 46 min\n  * The Unfulfilled Engineer Jan 02, 2023 42 min\n  * DOOMed to Fail: A Horror Story Dec 02, 2022 45 min\n  * Software World Tour Nov 02, 2022 48 min\n  * Android's Unlikely Success Oct 03, 2022 60 min\n  * From Prison To Programming Sep 02, 2022 46 min\n  * CPAN Aug 01, 2022 56 min\n  * The History and Mystery Of Eliza Jul 05, 2022 44 min\n  * Why still 80 columns?
