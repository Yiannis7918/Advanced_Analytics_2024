The work was undertaken with support from the Economic\nand Social Research Council whose help we would like to acknowledge. In\nproducing this study our intention was not to \u2018monitor\u2019 the media or to\ncriticise individual journalists. Our intention was to discuss the pressures\nand structures within which they work to show the effects of those on new\ncontent and to examine the role of the media in the construction of public\nknowledge. It is a very extensive study with an audience sample of over 800\npeople and a detailed analysis of TV news over a two-year period. This work\nalso raises a series of important theoretical issues in mass communications.\nThe main focus of the book is on giving a clear exposition of our methods and\nresults, but the theoretical concerns are latent and there is a more detailed\ndiscussion of them in other work by the Media Group.\n\nBuy a copy\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2007 - 2024 Glasgow Media Group Web Development By SCS Web Design\n\n", "frontpage": true}
