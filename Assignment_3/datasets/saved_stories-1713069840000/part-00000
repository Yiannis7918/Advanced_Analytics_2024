You might think it\u2019s your parents, spouse, or a\nteacher. But in fact, you most trust your culture, as you are part of a\nspecies, humans, with the superpower of cultural evolution. So as a kid, you\neagerly accepted most of what your prestigious associates said, especially if\nthey had long agreed on it. You\u2019re also inclined to accept changes to your\nculture, and to dismiss the contrary opinions of outsiders. You trust your\nculture not just on practical facts but on deep values and sacred feelings.\nYour culture\u2019s instructions feel like a warm, loving embrace. You even find it\nhard to notice when you\u2019re trusting your culture; its claims feel like obvious\nfacts that no sane person could question.\n\nDo cultures deserve this trust? They used to. For most of human history, the\nfact that your culture existed was evidence that it had done well for your\nancestors and would likely do well for you. (This didn\u2019t mean your culture\u2019s\nclaims were literally true, just that they were a reliable compass for\nliving.) But today is no typical day in history. Until a few centuries ago,\nthe world had hundreds of thousands of cultures. Each small peasant community\nwas mostly self-sufficient, in effect a separate \u201cmacro\u201d culture. Suspicious\nof neighbors, but mostly peacefully coexisting, each was relatively free to\ndefy a neighbor\u2019s disapproval if it didn\u2019t defy an encompassing empire.\n\nBut in the last few centuries, states merged these local cultures into nation-\nscale macro cultures. (For more on this, see Eugene Weber\u2019s 1976 book,\nPeasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France, 1870\u20131914.) And\nlately we\u2019ve seen the rise of a global elite culture. Top university graduates\nfrom around the world mix at events like Davos, set convergent policy\nworldwide, and serve as interchangeable professionals in global organizations.\nThe small peasant cultures of yesterday were poor, reluctant to change, and\nsubject to frequent epidemics, famines, and invasions. They faced strong\nselection pressures\u2014one false move could kill them. In contrast, today\u2019s\nhandful of huge, rich, fast-changing cultures face weak selection pressures\nand can survive many false moves. Paradoxically, that\u2019s just why you should\nmaybe distrust them.\n\nHere, I want to persuade you that your macro culture is likely drifting off\nthe rails and taking you with it. I will start by explaining a bit more about\nhow culture works with a couple of simpler examples.\n\nExample 1: Corporate Cultures\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to get good data on macro cultures, we have much better data\non corporate cultures. Today, there are 166,000 US employers with at least 100\nemployees; half of new firms die in five years, and firms last on the Fortune\n500 list for 15 years on average.\n\nA firm\u2019s tangible assets include buildings, machines, contracts, and\ninventory. But for firms in the S&P 500, only 10 percent of firm value, on\naverage, is accounted for by such assets. A bit more firm value comes from\nstrategy: tech adoption, org charts, product designs, pricing strategies, and\nso on. But as these are standard, easy to change in response to success or\nfailure, and easy for competitors to copy, they can\u2019t make up much more than\nanother 10 percent of stable firm value. (Yes, firms gain from customer and\npartner respect, but these are mostly downstream of prior firm behaviors.)\n\nBut firms are complex social systems. They have many parts that are hard to\nsee, understand, or control. Parts that add up to \u201cthe way we do things around\nhere.\u201d Some of those parts are stable, shared across the firm, and hard to\nvary within the firm, such as status markers and behavior norms. These add up\nto a firm\u2019s \u201ccorporate culture,\u201d which seems to account for most firm value;\nfirms with good cultures are worth far more than those without.\n\nCorporate cultures change in response to market conditions, macro cultures,\nand managerial strategies. But they change even more from complex,\nunpredictable processes within culture, such as firm factions fighting over\nthe directions of local cultural change. And if firm culture accounts for most\nof firm value, its changes should account for most changes in firm value, such\nas when they go in or out of the Fortune 500, or when they go out of business\naltogether.\n\nAware of this fact, firm managers try to steer their cultures as best they\ncan. This can take five years or more, and even then, two in three attempts to\nchange firm culture fail. The usual life history of a firm\u2019s culture is that,\nafter some initial improvement, it will tend to drift, accumulating\ndysfunction, until the firm ceases to be worth saving and dies. Of course,\nthere\u2019s a lot of variation; some firms improve for a long time before\ndecaying.\n\nThis process explains slower growth in older firms, and in industries where a\nfew big firms rule. That is, firms that don\u2019t start out with sufficiently\nfunctional cultures never get off the ground. And for the rest, an initially\nfunctional culture drifts fast in the space of possible cultures, sometimes to\nbetter places, but more often to places that are bad for profits or survival.\n\nOn average, firms today are more productive than in past centuries because\nthey benefit from better technology and better cultures. But why is that so if\neach firm\u2019s culture degrades over time? The key is selection: firms with bad\ncultures go out of business fast, while those with good ones grow, inspiring\nnew firms to copy them. If the world had only a few firms, each of which\nlasted centuries, we\u2019d see vastly worse corporate cultures and far less\nprogress overall.\n\nExample 2: Biology\n\nCompared to plants and animals that live in the ocean, species that live\ninland (especially in rivers or tropical rainforests) have smaller spatial\nhabitats and consequently fewer members. Between 85 and 95 percent of all\nmacroscopic species now live inland. And since it\u2019s typically harder for\nbiological innovations to jump across species than to spread within them, you\nmight think this would make inland innovation slower, compared to ocean\ninnovation.\n\nBut land (and river and rainforest) species have been especially innovative,\nwith their descendants disproportionately colonizing other habitats. While\ninnovations within a species must stay consistent with the defining features\nof a species, innovation in the features that define a species requires\nselection between species. And the latter sort matters more.\n\nNow let us generalize from our two cases: species and corporate cultures. For\neach type of unit, innovation happens at two levels: within units and between\nunits. Having larger units promotes within-unit innovation but hurts between-\nunit innovation. As that latter sort usually matters more, innovation gains\noverall by having more smaller units instead of few larger ones. For example,\nin retail firms, more innovation happens via new better firms replacing old\nworse ones, instead of firms getting better.\n\nHow Macro Cultures Work\n\nMacro cultures are parts of our larger social systems\u2014like nations\u2014that are\nhard to see, understand, or control. These parts, such as status markers and\nbehavior norms, are also stable, shared across the larger unit, and hard to\nvary within them. As with firms, variations in the cultures of such units\nlikely account for most variation in unit success. For example, nations are\nrich mainly because they have good cultures.\n\nYes, our cultures have a complex fractal structure. We have cultures\nassociated not only with organizations, but also with professions, hobbies,\nethnicities, religions, cities, and generations. Here I focus on the cultures\nof our largest units, like nations, as their features are especially hard to\nchange, and we have less global variation in them.\n\nJust as for other kinds of culture, macro-culture innovation happens at two\nlevels: within and between. The recent big jump in the size of macro cultures\nhas boosted within-culture innovation, powering peace, trade, and fast-growing\nwealth. As a result, our few huge cultures today suffer much less from famine,\ndisease, or war. But because of these effects, we should expect to now get\nmuch less selection of cultures, and thus less long-run innovation.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that we\u2019re forgoing opportunities to improve our macro cultures.\nSelection may also be too weak\u2014at least in the short run\u2014to cancel the\nmistakes of cultural drift. Shouldn\u2019t we expect that macro cultures, when\nselection is weak, will drift into dysfunction just as firm cultures do?\n\nAfter all, most of humanity\u2019s cultural experience has been with cultures much\ncloser to the size of firms than nations, and so our cultural skills also work\nbetter at firm scales. And compared to firm leaders, macro-culture leaders\nhave far weaker incentives and powers to control culture. So, even with all\nthese advantages, if firm leaders still can\u2019t manage to prevent drift into\ndysfunction, what hope could macro culture leaders have?\n\nHowever, powerful social factions often fight hard to influence our macro-\nculture changes, and the winners of such fights have a strong interest in\nframing such changes as improvements, not dysfunction. They offer two main\nsupporting stories.\n\nStory 1: Context-Dependence\n\nPowerful social factions like to claim that cultural changes are reasonable\nadjustments to changing contexts, like tech, density, wealth, ease of talk, or\nlifespans. We aren\u2019t changing our deep values, they say, just our surface\nbehaviors. After all, when plants and animals change their behaviors with\ncontext, like the time of day, they typically execute sensible pre-programmed\nadaptations. Might human cultural changes be like that?\n\nFirst, this can\u2019t explain a single culture splitting into different versions\nthat behave differently in the same new context. For example, if our ancestors\nwere reborn, and acted here more like they did in their era than like we do\nnow, that would suggest that our deep values have changed.\n\nSecond, cultural evolution is a new thing in the world, pioneered only\nrecently by humans. So cultural processes are far cruder than most DNA-built\nstructures and processes. Culture is more like the first powered planes, with\na few hundred miles of flight per fatality, than commercial planes today, with\nten billion miles per fatality. We shouldn\u2019t expect culture to have as many\nsubtle adaptations for context-dependence as DNA-designed organs.\n\nThird, consider a few of the macro-culture changes in my lifetime: a big rise\nin parental attention; a switch from cornerstone to capstone marriage norms\n(i.e., waiting for stable career and personality); longer career prep; a\npreference for cities; great declines in religion, patriotism, and militarism;\nfar more acceptance of homo- and trans-sexuality; far stronger norms against\nsexist or racist language; and national cultures merging into a global\nculture, especially among elites. If these were simply our adapting constant\ndeep values to new contexts, why do they look more like values changes? As\nhumans are familiar with consciously adjusting behavior to context, why didn\u2019t\nculture just tell us our deep values, and then let us consciously adjust\nbehavior?\n\nFourth, wouldn\u2019t pre-programmed changes to context be more predictable, at\nleast once you knew of the new contexts? Yet many cultural changes are hard to\npredict. Yes, one can predict that, once elites accept a new value, masses\nwill follow later. But those initial elite values seem hard to predict. Also,\nmany culture changes, like Neolithic pottery styles or US baby names, seem to\nquite clearly reflect random drift.\n\nConsider that Hitler taking over Germany, and then losing WWII, were among the\nmost influential cultural events of the 20th century. Yet these processes were\nhard to predict. Similarly, whether or not world elites will take a pro- or\nanti-Israel stance in a few decades\u2019 time looks important for future culture\nbut hard to predict now.\n\nAIs Will Be Our Mind Children\n\nWe must free our artificial descendants to adapt to their new worlds and\nchoose what they will become.\n\nQuilletteRobin Hanson\n\nStory 2: Learning\n\nThe second main story that social factions offer to frame their culture\nchanges as improvements, not dysfunction, is learning. They say that\nbiological or cultural evolution endowed us with constant deep values with\nunclear implications. So our beliefs about the practical implications of those\ndeep values change as we think more about them and test ways to achieve them.\n\nNow this learning theory has a clear implication: changes of best estimates\nregarding practical implications due to learning should follow random walks,\nwhere it is hard to predict the next step of the walk from all prior steps, on\naverage. As above, there could be predictable delays where elites learn of\nsomething first, which then percolates to the masses with time. But elite view\nchanges should be unpredictable. Yet many cultural changes seem to be more\npredictable than this.\n\nMore important, as-yet-unnoticed implications of deep values couldn\u2019t have\nbeen selected for by biological or cultural evolution. As selection acts only\ndirectly on behavior, any prior selection would have been for the previous\nestimates, not their deeper supporting values. From the point of view of\nevolution, changes to behavior estimates represent out-of-control drift, not\ninformation on the adaptive power of the deeper values.\n\nFertility Decline: Proof of Culture Drift\n\nThe clearest proof of biologically maladaptive culture drift is fertility.\nChildren per woman per lifetime has been declining worldwide for centuries,\nand is now below replacement levels almost everywhere. Earth passed peak\nbirths in 2016, and in a few decades, we\u2019ll pass peak population. Absent huge\nAI advances, innovation rates will then fall even faster than the population,\ncausing a many-centuries-long innovation pause, and then less liberal\ngovernance, perhaps including even the return of slavery.\n\nThis fertility fall is driven by many strong and beloved cultural trends,\nincluding more gender equality, more intensive parenting, longer inflexible\ncareer paths, less religion, more urbanity, capstone replacing cornerstone\nmarriage, and less grandparent involvement. On the whole, these look more like\nnon-adaptive value drifts than adaptive learning or context-dependence. And\nhaving fertility fall below replacement during times of plenty seems clearly\nmaladaptive. While policy solutions exist, like big payouts to parents, they\nseem unlikely to be adopted, as they need us to care enough, and to allow the\nreversal of beloved trends.\n\nHow exactly did culture drift to hurt fertility? Maybe many independent trends\njust added up to that. But another possibility is that high-status folks had\nwealth to invest in kids and widespread status markers that could be improved\nby wealth. Then our general cultural habit of copying high-status behavior\ncould have combined with a selection effect: having fewer kids causes each to\nhave higher status. This pattern was widely reported in history, at least\namong elites.\n\nJust as our cultural drift story predicts, the main fertility exceptions we\nsee are in fragmented, very insular cultures like Mennonites, Amish, and\nHaredim. By doubling every two decades, they look on track to replace our\nmainline civilization in a few centuries, just as Christians once took over\nRome with similar growth rates over a similar timescale. And just as\nChristians discarded many things they didn\u2019t like about Roman civilization,\nthese new groups may discard many aspects of our liberal civilization that we\nnow treasure.\n\nIn fact, many ancient civilizations like Greece and Rome plausibly fell due to\nlow fertility. And humanity may repeat this pattern: innovation causing wealth\ncausing fewer richer cultures, which drift, fall, and fragment. Culture\nselection then heals drifts, letting civilizations rise again.\n\nIs There a Fix?\n\nEventually, when our descendants spread across the stars, long communication\ndelays will ensure cultural fragmentation, and thus more selection. (Fast or\neasily copied minds might also work, as in my book Age of Em.) Before then, I\nsee only three fixes: conservative, totalitarian, and multicultural. And none\nseems likely to work (though we should try).\n\nThe conservative fix is to revert culture back to a point when cultural\nselection was strong, and then stop it from changing. If these cultural values\nare shallow, this would forgo gains from adapting deep values to changing\nconditions since then. But agreeing on deeper underlying conservative values\nseems hard.\n\nThe totalitarian fix is for culture leaders to take strong control of culture,\nto stop maladaptive change. But such leaders would need to manage this much\nbetter than either CEOs do for corporate cultures or autocrats do for nations.\n\nThe third fix is deep multiculturalism, wherein cultures with deeply divergent\nnorms and values still somehow maintain peaceful trade and tech exchange. This\nfixes only variety problems, and not weak selection pressures, and it requires\nmuch stronger global tolerance than today\u2019s \u201cboutique\u201d multiculturalism, which\ntolerates varying clothes, foods, or language, but not deep values. Deep\nmulticulturalism does engage many who are disturbed to see world capitalism\nsteamroll small indigenous cultures, and also some libertarians like Robert\nNozick. But not most people. For example, I conducted Twitter polls on 12\nkinds of diversity, and \u201cfundamental values\u201d was the kind where respondents\nmost wanted less diversity.\n\n> Poll % diff between want more vs want less diversity: business (+69),\n> intellectual (+66), musical (+61), bio-species (+57), governance (+40),\n> culture (+17), social norms (+10), legal (-1), language (-28), height (-30),\n> tech standards (-38), fundamental values (-42).\n>\n> \u2014 Robin Hanson (@robinhanson) March 8, 2024\n\nNote that all of these fixes require either changing world culture as a whole,\nor changing some big part that is strongly insulated against mainstream\ncultural influence. Our world is like a big ship heading for an iceberg; we\nmust either turn it or rush for the lifeboats. So, alas, our likely fate\nbefore we reach the stars seems to be as follows: world civilizations\nrepeatedly rise, suffer cultural drift, and fall. As they chanted in\nBattlestar Galactica, \u201cAll this has happened before; all this will happen\nagain.\u201d\n\n  * Politics\n  * culture\n  * philosophy\n\n### Robin Hanson\n\nRobin Hanson is an associate professor of economics at George Mason University\nand a research associate at the Future of Humanity Institute of Oxford\nUniversity.\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Website\n\nKeep Reading\n\n## Graham Linehan Was Right About Gender Ideology: Quillette Cetera Episode 33\n\nThe cancelled comedy writer joins Zoe in the studio to talk about his new\nmemoir.\n\nZoe Booth\n\n13 Apr 2024 \u00b7 1 min read\n\n## Desire and Ambition\n\nToday, most of John Braine\u2019s work is out of print and forgotten.
