This channel would\nsupport one-way traffic in and out of the Port of Baltimore for barge\ncontainer service and some roll on/roll off vessels that move automobiles and\nfarm equipment to and from the port.\n\nUSACE engineers are aiming to reopen the permanent, 700-foot-wide by 50-foot-\ndeep federal navigation channel by the end of May, restoring port access to\nnormal capacity.\n\n\u201cThanks to the exhaustive work of the unified command during the last two\nweeks, including underwater surveys and detailed structural analysis of the\nwreckage, we\u2019ve developed a better understanding of the immense and complex\nwork that lies ahead,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Scott A. Spellmon, USACE commanding\ngeneral. \u201cA fully opened federal channel remains our primary goal, and we will\ncarry out this work with care and precision, with safety as our chief\npriority.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are ambitious timelines that may still be impacted by significant\nadverse weather conditions or changes in the complexity of the wreckage,\u201d\nSpellmon added. \u201cWe are working quickly and safely to clear the channel and\nrestore full service at this port that is so vital to the nation. At the same\ntime, we continue to keep faith with the families of the missing and are\nworking with our partners to help locate and recover their loved ones.\u201d\n\n#### RELATED STORIES\n\n  * April 14, 2023Finance Sergeants Major Gain Insight and Discuss Initiatives at the Pentagon\n  * April 12, 2022U.S. Army STAND-TO! | Army Organic Industrial Base Modernization Implementation Plan\n  * June 23, 2021Acting Army assistant secretary announces USACE will conduct an EIS for Enbridge Line 5\n  * May 31, 2019Department of the Army announces upcoming III Corps Headquarters deployment\n  * March 19, 2016Department of the Army announces deployment of Fort Bragg-based units\n  * June 25, 2015DOI, USDA, EPA, NOAA and USACE announce additional Resilient Lands and Waters Initiative sites to pr\n\n  * U.S. Army Corps of Engineers develops tentative timeline to reopen Fort McHenry Channel following Key Bridge collapse\n\n  * Official U.S. Army Facebook\n  * Official U.S. Army Twitter\n  * Official U.S. Army YouTube\n  * Official U.S. Army Instagram\n  * Official U.S. Army LinkedIn\n\n  * Home\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms Of Use\n  * Accessibility\n  * FOIA\n  * No FEAR Act\n\n## Social Sharing\n\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Reddit\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Share via Email\n\n", "frontpage": false}
