Just don\u2019t expect a \u2018productivity miracle\u2019 anytime soon\n\nBYWill Daniel\n\nMarch 28, 2024 at 7:42 AM UTC\n\nLarry Summers, president emeritus and professor at Harvard University, during\na Bloomberg Television interview at the Allen & Co. Media and Technology\nConference in Sun Valley, Idaho, US, on Thursday, July 13, 2023.\n\nPhotographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nEver since OpenAI released its generative AI chatbot ChatGPT in November 2022,\ninvestors have flocked to companies with links to AI to try to profit from the\nworld-changing technology. The hype has been so extreme that it sparked a\ndebate on Wall Street over whether investors are justified in their AI\nenthusiasm\u2014or if they\u2019re getting too excited.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who joined ChatGPT developer OpenAI\u2019s\nboard of directors late last year, weighed in on this debate at the Fortune\nInnovation Forum in Hong Kong on Thursday. \u201cThe right general rule with\nrespect to technological innovation is that things take longer to happen than\nyou think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought they could,\u201d\nhe said.\n\nUnlike many proponents of AI, Summers thinks AI\u2019s potential isn\u2019t going to\nfully reveal itself anytime soon. \u201cI don\u2019t think that this is going to drive a\nproductivity miracle in the next three to five years,\u201d he said.\n\nSummers said that crossing the \u201clast mile\u201d of technological development\u2014when a\nrevolutionary technology turns into something that the general public can\nuse\u2014usually takes longer than people hope. He cited what he termed the\n\u201cproductivity J curve,\u201d arguing that realizing productivity gains from a new\nidea takes years of investment, research and development.\n\n\u201cThink, for example, about autonomous vehicles. Tens, if not hundreds of\nthousands of workers have for years been devoting themselves to autonomous\nvehicles...and as yet, there have been no chauffeurs or truck drivers or taxi\ndrivers who have lost their job,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a bunch of labor being\ndevoted to autonomous vehicles, and no output that is measured in the\nstatistics.\u201d\n\nBut the OpenAI board director is far from an AI skeptic.\n\n\u201cIf one takes a view over the next generation, this could be the biggest thing\nthat has happened in economic history since the Industrial Revolution,\u201d he\nadded. \u201cThis offers the prospect of not replacing some forms of human labor,\nbut almost all forms of human labor.\u201d\n\nFrom building homes to making medical diagnoses, Summers predicted that AI\nwill eventually be able to do nearly every human job, particularly white\ncollar workers\u2019 \u201ccognitive labor.\u201d\n\nThat will eventually make EQ, or emotional intelligence, more important than\nIQ.\n\n\u201cAI will substitute for a doctor making a difficult diagnosis...before it\nsubstitutes for a nurse\u2019s ability to hold a patient\u2019s hand when the patient is\nfrightened,\u201d he said.\n\n## Latest in Tech\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Tech - semiconductors\n\n## The U.S. reportedly wants the Netherlands to stop fixing advanced\nchipmaking tools sold to China\n\nBYLionel Lim\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\n  * 4 days ago\n  * Tech - electric vehicles\n\n## Analysts explain the rise of China\u2019s EV sector\u2014and how it might navigate\nprotectionist backlash and Beijing withdrawing support\n\nBYLionel Lim\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\n  * 4 days ago\n  * Tech - byd\n\n## BYD lost its EV crown to Tesla after just one quarter as China\u2019s EV market\nslumps\n\nBYLionel Lim\n\nApril 3, 2024\n\n  * 5 days ago\n  * Tech - Taiwan\n\n## Leading chipmaker TSMC evacuates staff and pauses some machinery after\nTaiwan\u2019s largest earthquake in a quarter-century\n\nBYDebby Wu and Bloomberg\n\nApril 3, 2024\n\n  * 5 days ago\n  * Tech - semiconductors\n\n## U.S. pushes South Korea to follow its lead and tighten export controls on\nchips for China\n\nBYMacKenzie Hawkins, Sam Kim, and others\n\nApril 2, 2024\n\n  * 5 days ago\n  * Tech - Xiaomi\n\n## Xiaomi warns potential customers that they may need to wait over half a\nyear to get the company\u2019s new EV, as its shares jump by as much as 16%\n\nBYLionel Lim\n\nApril 2, 2024\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Success\n\n## Nearly a quarter of baby boomer and late Gen X men are \u2018unretiring\u2019 or\nplanning to because they can\u2019t afford to kick up their feet in the current\nclimate\n\nBYOrianna Rosa Royle\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\n  * 3 days ago\n  * Success\n\n## California\u2019s new $20-an-hour fast food minimum wage is so good that schools\nare worried they can\u2019t compete for cafeteria workers\n\nBYAdam Beam and The Associated Press\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\n  * 3 days ago\n  * Success\n\n## MacKenzie Scott\u2019s game-changing philanthropy still mystifies nonprofits:\n\u2018Her gifts are super generous, but unfortunately, they don\u2019t provide long term\nsustainability\u2019\n\nBYThalia Beaty and The Associated Press\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\n  * 3 days ago\n  * Companies\n\n## Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s mom tried to explain her son to the judge: \u2018He has\nnever felt happiness or pleasure in his life and does not think he is capable\nof feeling it\u2019\n\nBYMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Success\n\n## Barry Diller proposes a four-day workweek only a billionaire could love: Go\nto the office every day except Friday, when you can work from home\n\nBYJane Thier\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\n  * a day ago\n  * Tech\n\n## Elon Musk might not be leading a hyper-growth EV maker, after all, and\nanalysts are taking note: \u2018We caution Tesla shares could fall much further\nstill\u2019\n\nBYEsha Day and Bloomberg\n\nApril 6, 2024\n\n\u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
