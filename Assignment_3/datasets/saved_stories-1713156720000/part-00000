I was reluctant. I remembered almost nothing of the book\nand said so - but Denison Demac, the lovely young woman who is my contact at\nFNS, simply sent me a copy of it and said, 'Read it.' So I read it and found\nmyself absolutely astonished at what I read. I wondered how many people who\ntalked about the novel so glibly had ever read it; or if they had, whether\nthey remembered it at all. I felt I would have to write the critique if only\nto set people straight. (I'm sorry; I love setting people straight.)\n\nA. THE WRITING OF 1984 In 1949, a book entitled 1984 was published. It was\nwritten by Eric Arthur Blair under the pseudonym of George Orwell. The book\nattempted to show what life would be like in a world of total evil, in which\nthose controlling the government kept themselves in power by brute force, by\ndistorting the truth, by continually rewriting history, by mesmerising the\npeople generally. This evil world was placed only thirty-five years in the\nfuture so that even men who were already in their early middle age at the time\nthe book was published might live to see it if they lived out a normal\nlifetime. I, for instance, was already a married man when the book appeared\nand yet here we are less than four years away from that apocalyptic year (for\n'1984' has become a year that is associated with dread because of Orwell's\nbook), and I am very likely to live to see it. In this chapter, I will discuss\nthe book, but first: Who was Blair/Orwell and why was the book written? Blair\nwas born in 1903 into the status of a British gentleman. His father was in the\nIndian civil service and Blair himself lived the life of a British Imperial\nofficial. He went to Eton, served in Burma, and so on. However, he lacked the\nmoney to be an English gentleman to the full. Then, too, he didn't want to\nspend his time at dull desk jobs; he wanted to be a writer. Thirdly, he felt\nguilty about his status in the upper class. So he did in the late 1920s what\nso many well-to-do American young people in the 1960s did. In short, he became\nwhat we would have called a 'hippie' at a later time. He lived under slum\nconditions in London and Paris, consorted with and identified with slum\ndwellers and vagrants, managed to ease his conscience and, at the same time,\nto gather material for his earliest books. He also turned left wing and became\na socialist, fighting with the loyalists in Spain in the 1930s. There he found\nhimself caught up in the sectarian struggles between the various left-wing\nfactions, and since he believed in a gentlemanly English form of socialism, he\nwas inevitably on the losing side. Opposed to him were passionate Spanish\nanarchists, syndicalists, and communists, who bitterly resented the fact that\nthe necessities of fighting the Franco fascists got in the way of their\nfighting each other. The communists, who were the best organised, won out and\nOrwell had to leave Spain, for he was convinced that if he did not, he would\nbe killed From then on, to the end of his life, he carried on a private\nliterary war with the communists, determined to win in words the battle he had\nlost in action. During World War II, in which he was rejected for military\nservice, he was associated with the left wing of the British Labour party, but\ndidn't much sympathise with their views, for even their reckless version of\nsocialism seemed too well organised for him. He wasn't much affected,\napparently, by the Nazi brand of totalitarianism, for there was no room within\nhim except for his private war with Stalinist communism. Consequently, when\nGreat Britain was fighting for its life against Nazism, and the Soviet Union\nfought as an ally in the struggle and contributed rather more than its share\nin lives lost and in resolute courage, Orwell wrote Animal Farm which was a\nsatire of the Russian Revolution and what followed, picturing it in terms of a\nrevolt of barnyard animals against human masters. He completed Animal Farm in\n1944 and had trouble finding a publisher since it wasn't a particularly good\ntime for upsetting the Soviets. As soon as the war came to an end, however,\nthe Soviet Union was fair game and Animal Farm was published. It was greeted\nwith much acclaim and Orwell became sufficiently prosperous to retire and\ndevote himself to his masterpiece, 1984. That book described society as a vast\nworld-wide extension of Stalinist Russia in the 1930s, pictured with the venom\nof a rival left-wing sectarian. Other forms of totalitarianism play a small\nrole. There are one or two mentions of the Nazis and of the Inquisition. At\nthe very start, there is a reference or two to Jews, almost as though they\nwere going to prove the objects of persecution, but that vanishes almost at\nonce, as though Orwell didn't want readers to mistake the villains for Nazis.\nThe picture is of Stalinism, and Stalinism only. By the time the book came out\nin 1949, the Cold War was at its height. The book therefore proved popular. It\nwas almost a matter of patriotism in the West to buy it and talk about it, and\nperhaps even to read parts of it, although it is my opinion that more people\nbought it and talked about it than read it, for it is a dreadfully dull book -\ndidactic, repetitious, and all but motionless. It was most popular at first\nwith people who leaned towards the conservative side of the political\nspectrum, for it was clearly an anti-Soviet polemic, and the picture of life\nit projected in the London of 1984 was very much as conservatives imagined\nlife in the Moscow of 1949 to be. During the McCarthy era in the United\nStates, 1984 became increasingly popular with those who leaned towards the\nliberal side of the political spectrum, for it seemed to them that the United\nStates of the early 1950s was beginning to move in the direction of thought-\ncontrol and that all the viciousness Orwell had depicted was on its way\ntowards us. Thus, in an afterword to an edition published in paperback by New\nAmerican Library in 1961, the liberal psychoanalyst and philosopher Erich\nFromm concluded as follows: 'Books like Orwell's are powerful warnings, and it\nwould be most unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted 1984 as another\ndescription of Stalinist barbarism, and if he does not see that it means us,\ntoo.' Even if Stalinism and McCarthyism are disregarded, however, more and\nmore Americans were becoming aware of just how 'big' the government was\ngetting; how high taxes were; how increasingly rules and regulations permeated\nbusiness and even ordinary life; how information concerning every facet of\nprivate life was entering the files not only of government bureaux but of\nprivate credit systems. 1984, therefore, came to stand not for Stalinism, or\neven for dictatorship in general - but merely for government. Even\ngovernmental paternalism seemed '1984ish' and the catch phrase 'Big Brother is\nwatching you' came to mean everything that was too big for the individual to\ncontrol. It was not only big government and big business that was a symptom of\n1984 but big science, big labour, big anything. In fact, so thoroughly has\n1984-ophobia penetrated the consciousness of many who have not read the book\nand have no notion of what it contains, that one wonders what will happen to\nus after 31 December 1984. When New Year's Day of 1985 arrives and the United\nStates is still in existence and facing very much the problems it faces today,\nhow will we express our fears of whatever aspect of life fills us with\napprehension? What new date can we invent to take the place of 1984? Orwell\ndid not live to see his book become the success it did. He did not witness the\nway in which he made 1984 into a year that would haunt a whole generation of\nAmericans. Orwell died of tuberculosis in a London hospital in January 1950,\njust a few months after the book was published, at the age of forty-six. His\nawareness of imminent death may have added to the bitterness of the book.\n\nB. THE SCIENCE FICTION OF 1984 Many people think of 1984 as a science fiction\nnovel, but almost the only item about 1984 that would lead one to suppose this\nis the fact that it is purportedly laid in the future. Not so! Orwell had no\nfeel for the future, and the displacement of the story is much more\ngeographical than temporal. The London in which the story is placed is not so\nmuch moved thirty-five years forward in time, from 1949 to 1984, as it is\nmoved a thousand miles east in space to Moscow. Orwell imagines Great Britain\nto have gone through a revolution similar to the Russian Revolution and to\nhave gone through all the stages that Soviet development did. He can think of\nalmost no variations on the theme. The Soviets had a series of purges in the\n1930s, so the Ingsoc (English Socialism) had a series of purges in the 1950s.\nThe Soviets converted one of their revolutionaries, Leon Trotsky, into a\nvillain, leaving his opponent, Joseph Stalin, as a hero. The Ingsoc,\ntherefore, convert one of their revolutionaries, Emmanuel Goldstein, into a\nvillain, leaving his opponent, with a moustache like Stalin, as a hero. There\nis no ability to make minor changes, even. Goldstein, like Trotsky, has 'a\nlean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee\nbeard'. Orwell apparently does not want to confuse the issue by giving Stalin\na different name so he calls him merely 'Big Brother'. At the very beginning\nof the story, it is made clear that television (which was coming into\nexistence at the time the book was written) served as a continuous means of\nindoctrination of the people, for sets cannot be turned off. (And, apparently,\nin a deteriorating London in which nothing works, these sets never fail.) The\ngreat Orwellian contribution to future technology is that the television set\nis two-way, and that the people who are forced to hear and see the television\nscreen can themselves be heard and seen at all times and are under constant\nsupervision even while sleeping or in the bathroom. Hence, the meaning of the\nphrase 'Big Brother is watching you'. This is an extraordinarily inefficient\nsystem of keeping everyone under control. To have a person being watched at\nall times means that some other person must be doing the watching at all times\n(at least in the Orwellian society) and must be doing so very narrowly, for\nthere is a great development of the art of interpreting gesture and facial\nexpression. One person cannot watch more than one person in full\nconcentration, and can only do so for a comparatively short time before\nattention begins to wander. I should guess, in short, that there may have to\nbe five watchers for every person watched. And then, of course, the watchers\nmust themselves be watched since no one in the Orwellian world is suspicion-\nfree. Consequently, the system of oppression by two-way television simply will\nnot work. Orwell himself realised this by limiting its workings to the Party\nmembers. The 'proles' (proletariat), for whom Orwell cannot hide his British\nupper-class contempt, are left largely to themselves as subhuman. (At one\npoint in the book, he says that any prole that shows ability is killed - a\nleaf taken out of the Spartan treatment of their helots twenty-five hundred\nyears ago.) Furthermore, he has a system of volunteer spies in which children\nreport on their parents, and neighbours on each other. This cannot possibly\nwork well since eventually everyone reports everyone else and it all has to be\nabandoned. Orwell was unable to conceive of computers or robots, or he would\nhave placed everyone under non-human surveillance. Our own computers to some\nextent do this in the IRS, in credit files, and so on, but that does not take\nus towards 1984, except in fevered imaginations. Computers and tyranny do not\nnecessarily go hand in hand. Tyrannies have worked very well without computers\n(consider the Nazis) and the most computerised nations in today's world are\nalso the least tyrannical. Orwell lacks the capacity to see (or invent) small\nchanges. His hero finds it difficult in his world of 1984 to get shoelaces or\nrazor blades. So would I in the real world of the 1980s, for so many people\nuse slip-on shoes and electric razors. Then, too, Orwell had the technophobic\nfixation that every technological advance is a slide downhill. Thus, when his\nhero writes, he 'fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the\ngrease off. He does so 'because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper\ndeserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an\nink-pencil'. Presumably, the 'ink-pencil' is the ball-point pen that was\ncoming into use at the time that 1984 was being written. This means that\nOrwell describes something as being written' with a real nib but being\n'scratched' with a ball-point. This is, however, precisely the reverse of the\ntruth. If you are old enough to remember steel pens, you will remember that\nthey scratched fearsomely, and you know ball-points don't. This is not science\nfiction, but a distorted nostalgia for a past that never was. I am surprised\nthat Orwell stopped with the steel pen and that he didn't have Winston writing\nwith a neat goose quill. Nor was Orwell particularly prescient in the strictly\nsocial aspects of the future he was presenting, with the result that the\nOrwellian world of 1984 is incredibly old-fashioned when compared with the\nreal world of the 1980s. Orwell imagines no new vices, for instance. His\ncharacters are all gin hounds and tobacco addicts, and part of the horror of\nhis picture of 1984 is his eloquent description of the low quality of the gin\nand tobacco. He foresees no new drugs, no marijuana, no synthetic\nhallucinogens. No one expects an s.f. writer to be precise and exact in his\nforecasts, but surely one would expect him to invent some differences. In his\ndespair (or anger), Orwell forgets the virtues human beings have. All his\ncharacters are, in one way or another, weak or sadistic, or sleazy, or stupid,\nor repellent. This may be how most people are, or how Orwell wants to indicate\nthey will all be under tyranny, but it seems to me that under even the worst\ntyrannies, so far, there have been brave men and women who have withstood the\ntyrants to the death and whose personal histories are luminous flames in the\nsurrounding darkness. If only because there is no hint of this in 1984, it\ndoes not resemble the real world of the 1980s. Nor did he foresee any\ndifference in the role of women or any weakening of the feminine stereotype of\n1949. There are only two female characters of importance. One is a strong,\nbrainless 'prole' woman who is an endless washerwoman, endlessly singing a\npopular song with words of the type familiar in the 1930s and 1940s (at which\nOrwell shudders fastidiously as 'trashy', in blissful non-anticipation of hard\nrock). The other is the heroine, Julia, who is sexually promiscuous (but is at\nleast driven to courage by her interest in sex) and is otherwise brainless.\nWhen the hero, Winston, reads to her the book within a book that explains the\nnature of the Orwellian world, she responds by falling asleep - but then since\nthe treatise Winston reads is stupefyingly soporific, this may be an\nindication of Julia's good sense rather than the reverse. In short, if 1984\nmust be considered science fiction, then it is very bad science fiction.\n\nC. THE GOVERNMENT OF 1984 Orwell's 1984 is a picture of all-powerful\ngovernment, and it has helped make the notion of 'big government' a very\nfrightening one. We have to remember, though, that the world of the late\n1940s, during which Orwell was writing his book, was one in which there had\nbeen, and still were, big governments with true tyrants - individuals whose\nevery wish, however unjust, cruel or vicious, was law. What's more, it seemed\nas though such tyrants were irremovable except by the chance of outside force.\nBenito Mussolini of Italy, after twenty-one years of absolute rule, was\noverthrown, but that was only because his country was suffering defeat in war.\nAdolf Hitler of Germany, a far stronger and more brutal tyrant, ruled with a\nsteel hand for twelve years, yet even defeat did not, in itself, bring about\nhis overthrow. Though the area over which he ruled shrank and shrank and\nshrank, and even though overwhelming armies of his adversaries closed in from\nthe east and west, he remained absolute tyrant over whatever area he\ncontrolled - even when it was only over the bunker in which he committed\nsuicide. Until he removed himself, no one dared remove him. (There were plots\nagainst him, to be sure, but they never worked, sometimes through quirks of\nfate that seemed explainable only by supposing that someone down there liked\nhim.) Orwell, however, had no time for either Mussolini or Hitler. His enemy\nwas Stalin, and at the time that 1984 was published, Stalin had ruled the\nSoviet Union in a ribbreaking bear hug for twenty-five years, had survived a\nterrible war in which his nation suffered enormous losses and yet was now\nstronger than ever. To Orwell, it must have seemed that neither time nor\nfortune could budge Stalin, but that he would live on forever with ever\nincreasing strength. - And that was how Orwell pictured Big Brother. Of\ncourse, that was not the way it really was. Orwell didn't live long enough to\nsee it but Stalin died only three years after 1984 was published, and it was\nnot long after that that his regime was denounced as a tyranny by - guess who\n- the Soviet leadership. The Soviet Union is still the Soviet Union, but it is\nnot Stalinist, and the enemies of the state are no longer liquidated (Orwell\nuses 'vaporised' instead, such small changes being all he can manage) with\nquite such abandon. Again, Mao Tse-tung died in China, and while he himself\nhas not been openly denounced, his close associates, as 'the Gang of Four',\nwere promptly demoted from Divinity, and while China is still China, it is not\nMaoist any longer. Franco of Spain died in his bed and while, to his very last\nbreath, he remained the unquestioned leader he had been for nearly forty\nyears, immediately after that last breath, Fascism abruptly dwindled in Spain,\nas it had in Portugal after Salazar's death. In short, Big Brothers do die, or\nat least they have so far, and when they die, the government changes, always\nfor the milder. This is not to say that new tyrants may not make themselves\nfelt, but they will die, too. At least in the real 1980s we have every\nconfidence they will and the undying Big Brother is not yet a real threat. If\nanything, in fact, governments of the 1980s seem dangerously weak. The advance\nof technology has put powerful weapons - explosives, machine guns, fast cars\ninto the hands of urban terrorists who can and do kidnap, hijack, gun down,\nand take hostages with impunity while governments stand by more or less\nhelplessly. In addition to the immortality of Big Brother, Orwell presents two\nother ways of maintaining an eternal tyranny. First -,present someone or\nsomething to hate. In the Orwellian world it was Emmanuel Goldstein for whom\nhate was built up and orchestrated in a robotized mass function. This is\nnothing new, of course. Every nation in the world has used various neighbours\nfor the purpose of hate. This sort of thing is so easily handled and comes as\nsuch second nature to humanity that one wonders why there have to be the\norganised hate drives in the Orwellian world. It needs scarcely any clever\npsychological mass movements to make Arabs hate Israelis and Greeks hate Turks\nand Catholic Irish hate Protestant Irish - and vice versa in each case. To be\nsure, the Nazis organised mass meetings of delirium that every participant\nseemed to enjoy, but it had no permanent effect. Once the war moved on to\nGerman soil, the Germans surrendered as meekly as though they had never Sieg-\nHeiled in their lives. Second - rewrite history. Almost every one of the few\nindividuals we meet in 1984 has, as his job, the rapid rewriting of the past,\nthe readjustment of statistics, the overhauling of newspapers - as though\nanyone is going to take the trouble to pay attention to the past anyway. This\nOrwellian preoccupation with the minutiae of 'historical proof' is typical of\nthe political sectarian who is always quoting what has been said and done in\nthe past to prove a point to someone on the other side who is always quoting\nsomething to the opposite effect that has been said and done. As any\npolitician knows, no evidence of any kind is ever required. It is only\nnecessary to make a statement - any statement - forcefully enough to have an\naudience believe it. No one will check the lie against the facts, and, if they\ndo, they will disbelieve the facts. Do you think the German people in 1939\npretended that the Poles had attacked them and started World War II? No! Since\nthey were told that was so, they believed it as seriously as you and I believe\nthat they attacked the Poles. To be sure, the Soviets put out new editions of\ntheir Encyclopaedia in which politicians rating a long biography in earlier\neditions are suddenly omitted entirely, and this is no doubt the germ of the\nOrwellian notion, but the chances of carrying it as far as is described in\n1984 seem to me to be nil - not because it is beyond human wickedness, but\nbecause it is totally unnecessary. Orwell makes much of 'Newspeak' as an organ\nof repression - the conversion of the English language into so limited and\nabbreviated an instrument that the very vocabulary of dissent vanishes. Partly\nhe got the notion from the undoubted habit of abbreviation. He gives examples\nof 'Communist International' becoming 'Comintern' and 'Geheime Staatspolizei'\nbecoming 'Gestapo', but that is not a modern totalitarian invention. 'Vulgus\nmobile' became 'mob'; 'taxi cabriolet' became 'cab'; 'quasi-stellar radio\nsource' became 'quasar'; 'light amplification by stimulated emission of\nradiation' became 'laser' and so on. There is no sign that such compressions\nof the language have ever weakened it as a mode of expression. As a matter of\nfact, political obfuscation has tended to use many words rather than few, long\nwords rather than short, to extend rather than to reduce. Every leader of\ninadequate education or limited intelligence hides behind exuberant\ninebriation of loquacity. Thus, when Winston Churchill suggested the\ndevelopment of 'Basic English' as an international language (something which\nundoubtedly also contributed to 'Newspeak'), the suggestion was stillborn. We\nare therefore in no way approaching Newspeak in its condensed form, though we\nhave always had Newspeak in its extended form and always will have. We also\nhave a group of young people among us who say things like 'Right on, man, you\nknow. It's like he's got it all together, you know, man. I mean, like you know\n-' and so on for five minutes when the word that the young people are groping\nfor is 'Huh?' That, however, is not Newspeak, and it has always been with us,\ntoo. It is something which in Oldspeak is called 'inarticulacy' and it is not\nwhat Orwell had in mind.\n\nD. THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION OF 1984 Although Orwell seemed, by and large,\nto be helplessly stuck in the world of 1949, in one respect at least he showed\nhimself to be remarkably prescient, and that was in foreseeing the tripartite\nsplit of the world of the 1980s. The international world of 1984 is a world of\nthree superpowers: Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia - and that fits in, very\nroughly, with the three actual superpowers of the 1980s: the United States,\nthe Soviet Union, and China. Oceania is a combination of the United States and\nthe British Empire. Orwell, who was an old Imperial civil servant, did not\nseem to notice that the British Empire was in its last throes in the late\n1940s and was about to dissolve. He seems to suppose, in fact, that the\nBritish Empire is the dominant member of the British-American combination. At\nleast, the entire action takes place in London and phrases such as 'the United\nStates' and 'Americans' are rarely, if ever, mentioned. But then, this is very\nmuch in the fashion of the British spy novel in which, ever since World War\nII, Great Britain (currently about the eighteenth strongest military and\neconomic power in the world) is set up as the great adversary of the Soviet\nUnion, or of China, or of some invented international conspiracy, with the\nUnited States either never mentioned or reduced to the small courtesy\nappearance of an occasional CIA agent. Eurasia is, of course, the Soviet\nUnion, which Orwell assumes will have absorbed the whole European continent.\nEurasia, therefore, includes all of Europe, plus Siberia, and its population\nis 95 per cent European by any standard. Nevertheless, Orwell describes the\nEurasians as 'solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces'. Since\nOrwell still lives in a time when 'European' and 'Asiatic' are equivalent to '\n'hero' and 'villain', it is impossible to inveigh against the Soviet Union\nwith the proper emotion if it is not thought of as 'Asiatic'. This comes under\nthe heading of what Orwellian Newspeak calls 'double-think', something that\nOrwell, like any human being, is good at. It may be, of course, that Orwell is\nthinking not of Eurasia, or the Soviet Union, but of his great b\u00eate noire,\nStalin. Stalin is a Georgian, and Georgia, lying south of the Caucasus\nmountains, is, by strict geographic considerations, part of Asia. Eastasia is,\nof course, China and various dependent nations. Here is prescience. At the\ntime Orwell was writing 1984, the Chinese communists had not yet won control\nof the country and many (in the United States, in particular) were doing their\nbest to see that the anti-Communist, Chiang Kai-shek, retained control. Once\nthe communists won, it became part of the accepted credo of the West that the\nChinese would be under thorough Soviet control and that China and the Soviet\nUnion would form a monolithic communist power. Orwell not only foresaw the\ncommunist victory (he saw that victory everywhere, in fact) but also foresaw\nthat Russia and China would not form a monolithic bloc but would be deadly\nenemies. There, his own experience as a Leftist sectarian may have helped him.\nHe had no Rightist superstitions concerning Leftists as unified and\nindistinguishable villains. He knew they would fight each other as fiercely\nover the most trifling points of doctrine as would the most pious of\nChristians. He also foresaw a permanent state of war among the three; a\ncondition of permanent stalemate with the alliances ever-shifting, but always\ntwo against the strongest. This was the old-fashioned 'balance of power'\nsystem which was used in ancient Greece, in medieval Italy, and in early\nmodern Europe. Orwell's mistake lay in thinking there had to be actual war to\nkeep the merry-go-round of the balance of power in being. In fact, in one of\nthe more laughable parts of the book, he goes on and on concerning the\nnecessity of permanent war as a means of consuming the world's production of\nresources and thus keeping the social stratification of upper, middle, and\nlower classes in being. (This sounds like a very Leftist explanation of war as\nthe result of a conspiracy worked out with great difficulty.) In actual fact,\nthe decades since 1945 have been remarkably war-free as compared with the\ndecades before it. There have been local wars in profusion, but no general\nwar. But then, war is not required as a desperate device to consume the\nworld's resources. That can be done by such other devices as endless increase\nin population and in energy use, neither of which Orwell considers. Orwell did\nnot foresee any of the significant economic changes that have taken place\nsince World War II. He did not foresee the role of oil or its declining\navailability or its increasing price, or the escalating power of those nations\nwho control it. I don't recall his mentioning the word 'oil'. But perhaps it\nis close enough to mark Orwellian prescience here, if we substitute 'cold war'\nfor 'war'. There has been, in fact, a more or less continual 'cold war' that\nhas served to keep employment high and solve some short-term economic problems\n(at the cost of creating long-term greater ones). And this cold war is enough\nto deplete resources. Furthermore, the alliances shifted as Orwell foresaw and\nvery nearly as suddenly. When the United States seemed all-powerful, the\nSoviet Union and China were both vociferously anti-American and in a kind of\nalliance. As American power decreased, the Soviet Union and China fell apart\nand, for a while, each of the three powers inveighed against the other two\nequally. Then, when the Soviet Union came to seem particularly powerful, a\nkind of alliance sprang up between the United States and China, as they co-\noperated in vilifying the Soviet Union, and spoke softly of each other. In\n1984 every shift of alliance involved an orgy of history rewriting. In real\nlife, no such folly is necessary. The public swings from side to side easily,\naccepting the change in circumstance with no concern for the past at all. For\ninstance, the Japanese, by the 1950s, had changed from unspeakable villains to\nfriends, while the Chinese moved in the opposite direction with no one\nbothering to wipe out Pearl Harbour. No one cared, for goodness' sake. Orwell\nhas his three great powers voluntarily forgo the use of nuclear bombs, and to\nbe sure such bombs have not been used in war since 1945. That, however, may be\nbecause the only powers with large nuclear arsenals, the United States and the\nSoviet Union, have avoided war with each other. Were there actual war, it is\nextremely doubtful that one side or the other would not finally feel it\nnecessary to push the button. In that respect, Orwell perhaps falls short of\nreality. London does, however, occasionally suffer a missile strike, which\nsounds very much like a V-1 or V-2 weapon of 1944, and the city is in a\n1945-type shambles. Orwell cannot make 1984 very different from 1944 in this\nrespect. Orwell, in fact, makes it clear that by 1984, the universal communism\nof the three superpowers has choked science and reduced it to uselessness\nexcept in those areas where it is needed for war. There is no question but\nthat the nations are more eager to invest in science where war applications\nare in clear view but, alas, there is no way of separating war from peace\nwhere applications are in question. Science is a unit, and everything in it\ncould conceivably be related to war and destruction. Science has therefore not\nbeen choked off but continues not only in the United States and Western Europe\nand Japan, but also in the Soviet Union and in China. The advances of science\nare too numerous to attempt to list, but think of lasers and computers as 'war\nweapons' with infinite peaceful applications. To summarise, then: George\nOrwell in 1984 was, in my opinion, engaging in a private feud with Stalinism,\nrather that attempting to forecast the future. He did not have the science\nfictional knack of foreseeing a plausible future and, in actual fact, in\nalmost all cases, the world of 1984 bears no relation to the real world of the\n1980s. The world may go communist, if not by 1984, then by some not very much\nlater date; or it may see civilisation destroyed. If this happens, however, it\nwill happen in a fashion quite different from that depicted in 1984 and if we\ntry to prevent either eventuality by imagining that 1984 is accurate, then we\nwill be defending ourselves against assaults from the wrong direction and we\nwill lose.\n\nreturn to front page\n\n", "frontpage": false}
