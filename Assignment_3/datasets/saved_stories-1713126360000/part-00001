When I first started on that chase in 1986, I had no idea\nwrhere it would lead me.\n\nA curious accounting error led me through Unix internals, tcp/ip protocols,\nearly Arpanet connections, and backwards to a group of computer hackers\nworking for then Soviet & Stassi agencies. Along the way, I met people from\nthe FBI, NSA, CIA, AFOSI, and plenty of very smart computer jocks.\n\nIt was a time of analog phones and dial up modems; when you would carry coins\nin your pocket to make calls on the street.\n\nSince then, thanks to the support of online friends and math folk, I have\nexplored and shared interests in topology and math. Along the way, I\u00e2(TM)ve\nmade plenty of mistakes and bloopers; pretty much the same as student times.\nGoofups in grad school are easier to sweep aside!\n\nTo all my friends: May you burdens be light and your purpose high.
