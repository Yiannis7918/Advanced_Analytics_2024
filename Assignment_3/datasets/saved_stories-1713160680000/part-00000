The year is\n1914.Worldwide war results, exhausting the resources of the great powers and\nconvincing many that the economic system itself is to blame. From the ashes of\nthe catastrophe, an intellectual and political struggle ignites between the\npowers of government and the forces of the marketplace, each determined to\nreinvent the world's economic order.Two individuals emerge whose ideas, shaped\nby very different experiences, will inform this debate and carry it forward.\nOne is a brilliant, unconventional Englishman named John Maynard Keynes. The\nother is an outspoken \u00e9migr\u00e9 from ravaged Austria, Friedrich von Hayek.But a\nworldwide depression holds the capitalist nations in its grip. In opposition\nto both Keynes and Hayek stand not only Hitler's Third Reich but Stalin's\nSoviet Union, schooled in the communist ideologies of Marx and Lenin and bent\non obliterating the capitalist system altogether.For more than half a century\nthe battle of ideas will rage. From the totalitarian socialist systems to the\nfascist states, from the independent nations of the developing world to the\nmixed economies of Europe and the regulated capitalism of the United States,\ngovernment planning will gradually take over the commanding heights.But in the\n1970s, with Keynesian theory at its height and communism fully entrenched,\neconomic stagnation sets in on all sides. When a British grocer's daughter and\na former Hollywood actor become heads of state, they join forces around the\nideas of Hayek, and new political and economic policies begin to transform the\nworld.| As the 1980s begin and the Cold War grinds on, the existing world\norder appears firmly in place. Yet beneath the surface powerful currents are\ncarving away at the economic foundations.Western democracies still struggle\nwith deficits and inflation, while communism hides the failure of its command\neconomy behind a facade of military might. In Latin America populist dictators\nstrive to thwart foreign economic exploitation, piling up debt and igniting\nhyperinflation in the process. In India and Africa bureaucracies established\nto end poverty through scientific planning spawn black markets and corruption\nand stifle enterprise.Worldwide, the strategies of government planning are\nfailing to produce their intended results. From Bolivia and Peru to Poland and\nRussia, the free-market policies of Thatcher and Reagan are looked to as a\npossible blueprint for escape. One by one, economies in crisis adopt \"shock\ntherapy\" -- a rapid conversion to free-market capitalism.As the command\neconomies totter and collapse, privatization transfers economic power back\ninto entrepreneurial hands, and whole societies go through wrenching change.\nFor some the demands and opportunities of the market provide a longed for\nliberation. Others, lacking the means to adapt, see their security and\nlivelihood swept away. In this new capitalist revolution enlightened\nenterprise and cynical exploitation thrive alike. The sum total of global\nwealth expands, but its unequal distribution increases, too, and economic\nregeneration exacts a high human price.| With communism discredited, more and\nmore nations harness their fortunes to the global free-market. China,\nSoutheast Asia, India, Eastern Europe, and Latin America all compete to\nattract the developed world's investment capital, and tariff barriers fall. In\nthe United States Republican and Democratic administrations both embrace\nunfettered globalization over the objections of organized labor.But as new\ntechnology and ideas drive profound economic change, unforeseen events unfold.\nA Mexican economic meltdown sends the Clinton administration scrambling.\nInternet-linked financial markets, unrestricted capital flows, and floating\ncurrencies drive levels of speculative investment that dwarf trade in actual\ngoods and services. Fueled by electronic capital and a global workforce ready\nto adapt, entrepreneurs create multinational corporations with valuations\ngreater than entire national economies.When huge pension funds go hunting\nhigher returns in emerging markets, enterprise flourishes where poverty once\nruled, but risk grows, too. In Thailand the huge reservoir of available\ncapital proves first a blessing, then a curse. Soon all Asia is engulfed in an\neconomic crisis, and financial contagion spreads throughout the world, until\nWall Street itself is threatened. A single global market is now the central\neconomic reality. As the force of its effects is felt, popular unease grows.\nIs the system just too complex to be controlled, or is it an insiders' game\nplayed at outsiders' expense? New centers of opposition to globalization form\nand the debate turns violent over who will rewrite the rules.Yet prosperity\ncontinues to spread with the expansion of trade, even as the gulf widens\nfurther between rich and poor. Imbalances too dangerous for the system to\nignore now drive its stakeholders to devise new means to include the\ndispossessed lest, once again, terrorism and war destroy the stability of a\ndeeply interconnected world.  \nHome | Storyline | Time-Map | Countries | People | Ideas | Discuss | Educators | Resources | Site Map | Credits | Glossary | Help  \n---  \n\u00a9 Copyright 2003 Heights Productions, Inc.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
