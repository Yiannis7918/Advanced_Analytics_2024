Deepfakes are often associated with political misinformation and\ndisinformation campaigns, but the combination of the increased quality of\ndeepfakes and the increased availability of the technology used to create them\n(there are now numerous sites and apps openly available that allow just about\nanyone to easily create a deepfake) has long been a concern of the private\nsector as well. In fact, as early as 2019, a UK-based company reportedly fell\nvictim to an audio deepfake in which an employee was convinced to transfer\nmoney to a fraudster who used voice generating-AI software to impersonate the\ncompany\u2019s CEO. More recently, a finance worker at a Hong Kong-based\nmultinational company was duped into transferring $25 million to fraudsters\nafter they set up a video call in which every other person participating,\nincluding someone impersonating the company\u2019s Chief Finance Officer, was a\nvideo deepfake.\n\nScreen capture displaying the WhatsApp attempted contact using deepfake audio\nas part of a CEO impersonation\n\nWhile reports of these sorts of deepfake calls targeting private companies are\nluckily still rare, LastPass itself experienced a deepfake attempt earlier\ntoday that we are sharing with the larger community to help raise awareness\nthat this tactic is spreading and all companies should be on the alert. In our\ncase, an employee received a series of calls, texts, and at least one\nvoicemail featuring an audio deepfake from a threat actor impersonating our\nCEO via WhatsApp. As the attempted communication was outside of normal\nbusiness communication channels and due to the employee\u2019s suspicion regarding\nthe presence of many of the hallmarks of a social engineering attempt (such as\nforced urgency), our employee rightly ignored the messages and reported the\nincident to our internal security team so that we could take steps to both\nmitigate the threat and raise awareness of the tactic both internally and\nexternally.\n\nTo be clear, there was no impact to our company. However, we did want to share\nthis incident to raise awareness that deepfakes are increasingly not only the\npurview of sophisticated nation-state threat actors and are increasingly being\nleveraged for executive impersonation fraud campaigns. Impressing the\nimportance of verifying potentially suspicious contacts by individuals\nclaiming to be with your company through established and approved internal\ncommunications channels is an important lesson to take away from this attempt.\nIn addition to this blog post, we are already working closely with our\nintelligence sharing partners and other cybersecurity companies to make them\naware of this tactic to help organizations stay one step ahead of the\nfraudsters.\n\n### Get started with LastPass Business\n\n14-day free LastPass Business trial.
