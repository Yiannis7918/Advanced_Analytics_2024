All\nof their actions were coordinated after significant preparation and\ndevelopment of the systems, simulations and integration with actual battle\nunits.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf someone thought the scenarios were imaginary\u201d where Israel would need long\nrange missile defense, they finally saw the relevance.\n\nPatel told how the program to defend against long range missiles started in\n1986 around when US President Ronald Reagan was also enthralled with the idea\nof truly effective missile defense (for the US against the Soviet Union.)\n\nAfter Iraq attacked Israel with a number of long range Scud missiles in 1991,\nthe program got a boost, said Patel.\n\nA police officer inspects the remains of a rocket booster that, according to\nIsraeli authorities critically injured a 7-year-old girl, after Iran launched\ndrones and missiles towards Israel, near Arad, Israel, April 14, 2024.\n(credit: REUTERS/CHRISTOPHE VAN DER PERRE )\n\nHowever, until Hezbollah rained down missiles on Israel in the 2006 Second\nLebanon war, missile defense was still sort of the \u201cforgotten stepchild\u201d of\nthe defense establishment with most IDF chiefs viewing it as a waste of\nlimited resources which would be better used to develop more offensive\nweapons.\n\n### Israel's various forms of air defense\n\nEventually, Iron Dome, which provides short range defense against high volumes\nof weaker Hamas and Hezbollah rockets, overtook the Arrow long range missile\ndefense as the \u201cfavored child\u201d among the political class.\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nStill, the Arrow missile system continued, and developed with versions II and\nIII, and eventually Israel also developed David\u2019s Sling for mid-tier defense,\ndrones, and cruise missiles.\n\nThe Arrow and David\u2019s Sling were the stars of Israel\u2019s defense against over\n300 aerial threats from Iran and its proxies overnight between Saturday and\nSunday.\n\nRelated TagsHezbollahDavid's Slingisrael iran attackisrael missile\ndefenseMiddle East\n\nTake Israel home with the new Jerusalem Post Store\n\nShop now >>\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nHot Opinion\n\n### Israel must not write off the Democratic party, but rather show it the\ntruth\n\nBy JPOST EDITORIAL\n\n### The Palestinian culture of hate and violence led to Oct. 7 - not previous\npeace accords - opinion\n\nBy URI PILICHOWSKI\n\n### The world must pay attention to terror warnings to thwart future attacks\n\nBy SALEM ALKETBI\n\n### Mergers and acquisitions: The impact of corporate culture\n\nBy ARONA MASKIL\n\n### Fake 'Jerusalem Post' journalist tried to interview former PMO spokesman\nEylon Levy\n\nBy ZVIKA KLEINMost Read\n\n1\n\n### Iran attacks Israel: No drones, cruise missiles breached Israeli airspace\n\n2\n\n### Iranian forces take over Israel-linked Portuguese ship MCS ARIES\n\n3\n\n### US repositions warships in expectation of Iranian attack\n\n4\n\n### Body of missing teenage shepherd found in the West Bank\n\n5\n\n### Overthrowing Jordan and courting Azerbaijan: Iran\u2019s master plan for the\nregion\n\nInformationAbout UsContact usFeedbackTerms Of ServicePrivacy PolicySubscriber\nAgreementJPost JobsCancel SubscriptionSitemap\u05e4\u05e8\u05e1\u05d5\u05dd \u05d1\u05d2'\u05e8\u05d5\u05d6\u05dc\u05dd \u05e4\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8Customer\nServiceAdvertise with UsThe Jerusalem Post GroupBreaking NewsWorld NewsIran\nNewsIvritTalk- Free trial lessonThe Jerusalem ReportJerusalem Post Lite\u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\n\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1Real Estate ListingsHypeSpecial ContentAdvisor50 JewsJP\nStoreBrandBlendTools and servicesJPost PremiumUlpan OnlineJPost NewsletterOur\nMagazinesLearn HebrewRSS feedJPost.com ArchiveDigital LibraryLists of Jewish\nholidaysLaw\u05dc\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d7\u05d2\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd 2023\u05d6\u05de\u05e0\u05d9 \u05db\u05e0\u05d9\u05e1\u05ea \u05e9\u05d1\u05eaSites Of InterestPoalim\nOnlineJNF-USAWho is HamasThe Jerusalem Post Customer Service Center can be\ncontacted with any questions or requests: Telephone: *2421 * Extension 4\nJerusalem Post or 03-7619056 Fax: 03-5613699 E-mail: subs@jpost.com The center\nis staffed and provides answers on Sundays through Thursdays between 07:00 AM\nand 14:00 PM and Fridays only handles distribution requests between 7:00 AM\nand 12:30 PM For international customers: The center is staffed and provides\nanswers on Sundays through Thursdays between 7AM and 14PM Israel time Toll\nFree number 1-800-448-9291 Telephone +972-3-761-9056 Fax: 972-3-561-3699\nE-mail: subs@jpost.comCopyright \u00a9 2024 Jpost Inc.
