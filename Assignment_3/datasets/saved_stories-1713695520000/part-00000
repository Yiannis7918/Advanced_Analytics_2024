Trained with a sugar distribution system\nconnected to a camera, a group of rats produces images of themselves by\ninteracting with the photographic apparatus. At first driven by the trained\ncompulsion to eat sugar, they eventually just playfully snap pictures. By\nechoing addictive behaviour engineered by social media companies to keep users\ncaptive, Lignier humorously addresses what cultural theorist Yves Citton calls\necology of attention, a coercive system, which commodifies our attentiveness\nwith a mechanism based on sheer pleasure.\n\nInstallation\n\nAll rights reserved 2023 \u00a9 Augustin Lignier\n\n", "frontpage": false}
