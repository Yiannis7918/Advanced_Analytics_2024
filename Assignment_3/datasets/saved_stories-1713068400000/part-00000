It used my name and\neverything, pretending to be my dad. (He did not accept my transition back in\nthe day, so it was immediately obvious)\n\nIf you thought the robocall waves were bad, just wait.\n\nApr 13, 2024, 03:05 PM\u00b7\u00b7Mastodon for iOS\n\n156boosts\u00b7171favorites\n\n7h\n\nAurora @CorioPsicologia\n\n@Haste Wow! This must be hard\n\n7h\n\nnish @nish@social.nishtahir.com\n\n@Haste It's tough to imagine that this will be the least believable they will\never be. The future is a scary place.\n\n6h\n\nMark Mason @markmason@mas.to\n\n@nish @Haste agree a family code phrase before it\u2019s too late.\n\n2h\n\nEVHaste @Haste\n\n@markmason @nish mines gonna be \u201cfunicular\u201d.\n\n2h\n\nEVHaste @Haste\n\n@nish On the bright side, I hate phone calls, so anything that makes them less\nnecessary in real life is great by me.\n\nLet\u2019s send them the way of the landline, babyyy\n\n6h\n\nM.S. Bellows, Jr. @msbellows@c.im\n\n@Haste Wait, someone took the time to track down your dad's voice and emulate\nit? Why?\n\n3h\n\nSamhain Night @samhainnight@mstdn.social\n\n@msbellows @Haste it\u2019s the latest scam\n\n2h\n\nEVHaste @Haste\n\n@samhainnight @msbellows Beats me, I\u2019m not calling them back. It wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen too hard to make though, he\u2019s apparently a YouTuber these days.\n\n6h\n\nBlippy the Wonder Slug @BlippyTheWonderSlug@ieji.de\n\n@Haste I haven't had a phone since my odyssey began. I call the thing in my\nhand a phone, but there's no voice plan on it. I suppose, in theory, it has a\nnumber, but... **shrugs**\n\nI had to figure out early how to make cheap calls to USA, went VOIP.\n\nI had a landline set up when I moved in at the ol' Imperial Palace, but\nagain... **shrugs** My mom calls on my birthday. My ex called once, when my\nhunting buddy in Montana died. No one else.\n\nMy kissmate gets spam constantly.\n\n6h\n\nkruschti @kruschti@libretooth.gr\n\n@Haste Yikes...\n\nDoes your dad speak publicly in some form (youtuber, podcaster, journalist,\npolitician, ...)?\n\nIf not, can you imagine how they got enough samples of your dad\u2019s voice?\n\n3h\n\nSamhain Night @samhainnight@mstdn.social\n\n@kruschti @Haste AI only needs a few words to emulate a person\u2019s voice. So if\nhe answered his phone and just said a few things, it\u2019s enough.\n\n2h\n\nEVHaste @Haste\n\n@kruschti Yeah, he\u2019s a YouTuber.\n\n6h\n\nRory @rlstone4dems\n\n@Haste Yeah, this AI stuff is going to get bad... I'm not there yet, but soon\nI'll be doubting the legitimacy of any call I receive. And that includes calls\nfrom from people, I never get calls from.\n\nHere's a red flag: If the president calls, it's fake as heck.\n\n6h\n\nMadeInDex.org @madeindex\n\n@Haste I noticed the older #people are the more #AI #scam and #spam #calls\nthey get.\n\n5h\n\nultraloveheaven \u029a\u2661\u025e @ultraloveheaven@computerfairi.es\n\n@Haste how did it sound AI-y? silly question maybe\n\n5h\n\nWhiteCatTamer @WhiteCatTamer@mastodon.online\n\n@ultraloveheaven @Haste Judging by OP\u2019s post, it used her correct pronouns\nwhen her father did not.\n\n2h\n\nultraloveheaven \u029a\u2661\u025e @ultraloveheaven@computerfairi.es\n\n@WhiteCatTamer @Haste i was just curious if it \u201csounded AI\u201d like a robocall\nbeyond this happening\n\n2h\n\nultraloveheaven \u029a\u2661\u025e @ultraloveheaven@computerfairi.es\n\n@WhiteCatTamer @Haste ohh i misread i\u2019m dumb lol\n\n2h\n\nWhiteCatTamer @WhiteCatTamer@mastodon.online\n\n@ultraloveheaven @Haste Naw don\u2019t worry about it.\n\nIt probably did sound off, anyways. Having listened to AI generated speech of\nBiden and Obama, both of whom have distinct speech patterns and plenty of\nmaterial to \u201clearn\u201d from, there\u2019s always that \u201cthis is..too...clean? Average?\u201d\nsense to them.\n\n2h\n\nEVHaste @Haste\n\n@ultraloveheaven @WhiteCatTamer In addition to the pronoun thing, it didn\u2019t\nsound exactly like him. It was close, but not consistent.\n\n2h\n\nWhiteCatTamer @WhiteCatTamer@mastodon.online\n\n@Haste @ultraloveheaven It\u2019s sorta like the audio version of a picture of\nsomeone with one half of their face mirrored. It may draw from the original\nbut it\u2019s TOO clean.\n\n5h\n\nWhiteCatTamer @WhiteCatTamer@mastodon.online\n\n@Haste This is BEGGING for a lawsuit claiming emotional distress and targeted\nharassment.\n\n5h\n\niam-py-test @iampytest1@infosec.exchange\n\n@WhiteCatTamer Against who? The AI companies?\n\n5h\n\nWhiteCatTamer @WhiteCatTamer@mastodon.online\n\n@iampytest1 Whoever left the voicemail.\n\n2h\n\niam-py-test @iampytest1@infosec.exchange\n\n@WhiteCatTamer Ok\n\n5h *\n\niam-py-test @iampytest1@infosec.exchange\n\n@Haste It's sad the way you knew it was not legit was because the scammers\nshow more respect than the people they are impersonating. Edit: missed the\nword \"not\"\n\n2h\n\nEVHaste @Haste\n\n@iampytest1 Every once in a while being trans makes life a little easier\ninstead of a struggle. That always makes me smile.\n\n2h\n\nJ.S\u029c\u1d00\u0280\u1d18F\u0280\u1d07\u1d07\u1d05\u1d0f\u1d0d&D\u1d07\u1d0d\u1d0f\u1d04\u0280\u1d00\u1d04\u028f @JSharp1436@mstdn.social\n\n@Haste\n\nSo the future will be:\n\n\"Hi granny, you need to use the passphrase otherwise you're not real and I'll\nterminate you...the call that is.

OR she'll laugh and say grandpa used to use \"cabbages\"\nback in the day - then *you'll* be shocked!\n\n29m\n\nKristian @kvaks@snabelen.no\n\n@Haste How long before they are able to generate responses fast enough to hold\na \"conversation\" with pretend-relative voices? Humans, are we sure making this\nstuff is such a great idea?
