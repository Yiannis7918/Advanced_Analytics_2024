But\nit\u2019s these constraints that give Twitter its distinct character. The fact that\nsome of them were originally born out of a technical necessity is kismet.\n\nScreenshot of Donald Trumps \u201ccovfefe\u201d tweet\n\nThese constraints have produced endless memorable moments \u2013 misspellings that\nremain etched in time like the infamous \u201ccovfefe\u201d tweet, people desperately\ntrying to compress their tweets to fit within the characters limit, story\nthreads that can span on for hundreds of posts, branching at each message, or\nthe whole ecosystem of automated and manual vanity accounts that do everything\nfrom colorizing pictures to rating your dog.\n\nIt\u2019s all in good fun, sometimes with a dark undertone, much like the human\ncondition. My point is, restrictions shape the platform and give it a\ndifferent sense of authenticity than a perfectly featured creation.\n\nThat\u2019s why many have recently been gravitating towards platforms with\ndeliberate constraints. We\u2019ve had everything from Vine, limiting the length of\nclips that could be posted, to Snapchat, which introduced ephemeral messaging\nto the masses. Recently we\u2019ve had another batch of even more restricting apps,\nlike BeReal which limits users to a single post at a designated daily time. As\nof this writing, BeReal ranks as the 13th most popular social media app on\niOS.\n\nScreenshot from Slowly marketing\n\nI frequently use Slowly, a pen pal app that emulates the heyday of letter\nwriting by making the digital letters take time to deliver, based on the\ngeographical distance between the sender and recipient. I love this\nrestriction because the consequence of it is taking away the constant stress\nwe feel from having to be constantly available on social media. Sending a\nletter on Slowly means taking a break, focusing on other things and waiting in\nanticipation for a response from your pen pal across the world.\n\nOccasionally I\u2019ll read the reviews for Slowly on the app store and see people\nrating it poorly because they can\u2019t understand why letters wouldn\u2019t be\ndelivered immediately. I guess you either get it or you don\u2019t.\n\nI see huge potential in platforms with thoughtfully chosen constraints in the\nfuture. How about a Twitter-like site where only valid haikus are allowed to\nbe posted? Or a social media platform where you can only communicate using\nhand drawn images? Maybe these ideas won\u2019t become the next unicorn startup,\nbut they\u2019d certainly provide a meaningful distraction to the dull platforms we\nuse today, which now include Twitter.\n\nHeader / social image generated by DALL-E.\n\nEssay\n\n  * Share:\n\n### Stanislav Khromov\n\nFull-stack impostor syndrome sufferer & Software Engineer at Schibsted Media\nGroup\n\n#### View Comments\n\nThere are currently no comments.\n\n### Cancel Reply\n\n#### Related post\n\n### A case for the mediocre developer\n\n  * 3rd Sep '20\n\nOpinion\n\n#### Related post\n\n### Hello world!\n\n  * 6th Jun '16\n\nPersonal\n\nNext Post\n\nGuides & Tutorials\n\n### The missing guide to understanding adapter-static in SvelteKit\n\nIn this guide we will go through the characteristics and quirks of adapter-\nstatic,...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
