What is gained as a result of cause and effect\nhas beginning and end, and thus will become nothing.\" Such remarks are like\nraising up waves in the windless ocean, or gouging a wound into healthy\nskin.Those who cling onto words are fools who believe that they can catch the\nmoon with a stick or can scratch their itchy foot through a leather shoe. How\ncan they \"see\" reality as it actually is?\n\nIn the Summer of the first year of Jotei (1228) Ekai (Mumon) was lecturing on\nkoan of the ancient masters to the monks at the monastery of Ryusho temple in\nEast China. He intended to use the koan as bricks for battering the gate in\norder to inspire the pursuer of Zen according to his ability. His notes were\nunwittingly collected. There is no order as to the beginning or the end. In\ntotal there are 48 cases, now called \"The Gateless Gate.\"\n\nIf anyone, like eight-armed Nata who bravely goes straight forward, ventures\ninto Zen practice, no delusion will disturb him. The Indian and Chinese\npatriarchs will beg for their lives in his commanding presence. If, however,\nhe hesitates even a moment, he is just a person that watches from a narrow\nwindow for a speedy horseman to pass by and misses everything in a wink.\n\n\"The Great Way has no gate, A thousand roads enter it. When one passes through\nthis gateless gate, He freely walks between heaven and earth.\"\n\nCASE 1. JOSHU'S DOG\n\nA monk asked Joshu, \"Has the dog the Buddha nature?\" Joshu replied, \"Mu\n(nothing)!\"\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nFor the pursuit of Zen, you must pass through the barriers (gates) set up by\nthe Zen masters. To attain his mysterious awareness one must completely uproot\nall the normal workings of one's mind. If you do not pass through the\nbarriers, nor uproot the normal workings of your mind, whatever you do and\nwhatever you think is a tangle of ghost. Now what are the barriers? This one\nword \"Mu\" is the sole barrier. This is why it is called the Gateless Gate of\nZen. The one who passes through this barrier shall meet with Joshu face to\nface and also see with the same eyes, hear with the same ears and walk\ntogether in the long train of the patriarchs. Wouldn't that be pleasant? Would\nyou like to pass through this barrier? Then concentrate your whole body, with\nits 360 bones and joints, and 84,000 hair follicles, into this question of\nwhat \"Mu\" is; day and night, without ceasing, hold it before you. It is\nneither nothingness, nor its relative \"not\" of \"is\" and \"is not.\" It must be\nlike gulping a hot iron ball that you can neither swallow nor spit out. T hen,\nall the useless knowledge you have diligently learned till now is thrown away.\nAs a fruit ripening in season, your internality and externality spontaneously\nbecome one. As with a mute man who had had a dream, you know it for sure and\nyet cannot say it. Indeed your ego-shell suddenly is crushed, you can shake\nheaven and earth. Just as with getting ahold of a great sword of a general,\nwhen you meet Buddha you will kill Buddha. A master of Zen? You will kill him,\ntoo. As you stand on the brink of life and death, you are absolutely free. You\ncan enter any world as if it were your own playground. How do you concentrate\non this Mu? Pour every ounce of your entire energy into it and do not give up,\nthen a torch of truth will illuminate the entire universe.\n\nHas a dog the Buddha nature? This is a matter of life and death. If you wonder\nwhether a dog has it or not, You certainly lose your body and life!\n\nCASE 2. HYAKUJO'S FOX\n\nWhenever Hyakujo delivered a Zen lecture, an old man was always there with the\nmonks listening to it; and when they left the Hall, so did he. One day,\nhowever, he remained behind, and Hyakujo asked,\"Who are you?\"\n\nThe old man replied,\"Yes, I am not a human being, but in the far distant past,\nwhen the Kashapa Buddha (the Sixth Buddha of the Seven Ancient Buddhas)\npreached in this world, I was the head monk in this mountain area. On one\noccasion a monk asked me whether an enlightened man could fall again under the\nlaw of karma (cause and effect), and I answered that he could not. Thus I\nbecame a fox for 500 rebirths and am still a fox. I beg you to release me from\nthis condition through your Zen words.\"\n\nThen he asked Hyakujo,\"Is an enlightened man subject to the law of karma?\"\nHyakujo answered, \"No one is free from the law of Karma.\"\n\nAt the words of Hyakujo the old man was enlightened, and said with a bow, \"I\nam now released from rebirth as a fox and my body will be found on the other\nside of the mountain. May I request that you bury me as a dead monk?\"\n\nThe next day Hyakujo had the Karmadana, or deacon, beat the clapper and he\ninformed the monks that after the midday meal there would be a funeral service\nfor a dead monk. \"No one was sick or died,\" wondered the monks. \"What does our\nRoshi mean?\" After they had eaten, Hyakujo led them to the foot of a rock on\nthe furthest side of the mountain, and with his staff poked the dead body of a\nfox and had it ritually cremated.\n\nIn the evening Hyakujo gave a talk to the monks and told them this story of\nthe law of Karma. Upon hearing the story, Obaku asked Hyakujo, \"You said that\nbecause a long time ago an old Zen master gave a wrong answer he became a fox\nfor 500 rebirths. But suppose every time he answered he had not made a\nmistake, what would have happened then?\" Hyakujo replied, \"Just come here to\nme, and I will tell you the answer!\" Obaku then went up to Hyakujo--and\nslapped the teacher's face. Hyakujo, clapping his hands and laughing,\nexclaimed, \"I thought the Persian had a red beard, but here is another one\nwith a red beard!\"\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\n\"The enlightened man is not subject to Karma.\" How can this answer make the\nmonk a fox? \"The enlightened man is not free from the law of karma.\" How can\nthis answer release him from his fox's life? If you have one eye in regard to\nthis, then you understand Hyakujo's (the old man's) dramatic 500 rebirths.\n\nFree from karma or subject to it, They are two sides of the same die. Subject\nto karma or free from it, Both are irredeemable errors.\n\nCASE 3. GUTEI'S FINGER\n\nGutei raised his finger whenever he was asked a question about Zen. A boy\nattendant began to imitate him in this way. When a visitor asked the boy what\nhis master had preached about, the boy raised his finger.\n\nGutei heard about the boy's mischief, seized him and cut off his finger with a\nknife. As the boy screamed and ran out of the room, Gutei called to him. When\nthe boy turned his head to Gutei, Gutei raised up his own finger. In that\ninstant the boy was enlightened.\n\nWhen Gutei was about to die, he said to the assembled monks,\"I received this\none-finger Zen from Tenryu. I used it all my life and yet could not exhaust\nit\" and then he passed away.\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nWhere Gutei and the boy attained enlightenment is not at the tip of the finger\nitself. If this simple truth is not comprehended, Tenryu, Gutei, the boy and\nyou also will be bound together once and for all.\n\nGutei made a fool of old Tenryu, With the sharp blade he did simply harm the\nboy. That's nothing compared to the Mountain Spirit when he raised his hand\nAnd split Kasan (the great mountain) in two.\n\nCASE 4. WAKU'AN'S \"WHY NO BEARD?\"\n\nWaku'an (looking at Bodhidharma's picture) complained, \"Why has that Barbarian\nno beard?\"\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nIf you study Zen, you must study it with all your heart. When you attain\nenlightenment, it must be true enlightenment. When you really meet Bodhidharma\nface to face, then you finally have gotten it right. However when you start\nexplaining it with words, you have fallen into duality.\n\nDo not explain your dream Before a fool. The barbarian has no beard, How could\nyou add obscurity to clarity?\n\nCASE 5. KYOGEN'S MAN HANGING IN THE TREE\n\nKyogen said, \"It (Zen) is like a man (monk) hanging by his teeth in a tree\nover a precipice. His hands grasp no branch, his feet rest on no limb, and\nunder the tree another man asks him, 'Why did Bodhidharma come to China from\nthe West (India)?' If the man in the tree does not answer, he misses the\nquestion, and if he answers, he falls and loses his life. Now what shall he\ndo?\"\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\n(In such a predicament) though your eloquence flows like a river, it is all to\nno avail. Even if you can explain all of the Buddhist sutras, that also is\nuseless. If you can rightly answer the question, you walk the road of killing\nthe living and reviving the dead. But if you cannot answer, you should wait\nfor ages and ask Maitreya, the future Buddha.\n\nKyogen had really bad taste, And spreads the poison everywhere, He stuffs with\nit the monks' mouths, And lets their tears stream from their dead eyes.\n\nCASE 6. THE BUDDHA'S FLOWER\n\nOnce upon a time when Buddha was in Grdhrakuta mountain, he twirled a flower\nin his finger and held it before his congregation. Everyone was silent. Only\nMaha Kashapa wholeheartedly smiled. Buddha said, \"I have the eye of the true\nteaching, the heart of Nirvana, the formless form, the mysterious gate of\nDharma. Beyond the words and beyond all teachings to be transmitted, I now\npass this on to Maha Kashapa.\"\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nGolden-faced Gautama impudently forced the good people into depravity. He sold\ndog meat under the name of mutton. And he thought he made it! What if all the\naudience had laughed together? How could he have handed the eye of the true\nteaching or if Kashapa had not smiled, how could he have transmitted the\nteaching? If you say it could be transmitted, he is like a golden-faced old\nhuckster swindling at the city gate, and if you say it cannot be transmitted,\nhow does he hand it on to Maha Kashapa?\n\nAt the turning of a flower, The snake (his disguise) shows his tail. Maha\nKashapa smiles, Every monk does not know what to do.\n\nCASE 7. JOSHU'S WASHING THE BOWL\n\nA monk told Joshu, \"I have just entered this monastery. I beg you to teach\nme.\" Joshu asked, \"Have you eaten your rice porridge?\" The monk replied, \"I\nhave.\" \"Then,\" said Joshu, \"Go and wash your bowl.\" At that moment the monk\nwas enlightened.\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nJoshu opened his mouth, showed his gall-bladder (true mind) and the depth of\nhis heart. If this monk did not really listen to and grasp the truth, he\nindeed mistook the bell for a pitcher.\n\nHe made it so simple and clear, It might take a long time to catch the point,\nIf one realizes that it's stupid to search for fire with a lantern light, The\nrice would not take so long to be done.\n\nCASE 8. KEICHU'S WHEEL\n\nGettan asked a monk, \"If Keichu (the ancient mythological wheel maker) made\none hundred carts, and if we took off the wheels and removed the hub uniting\nthe spokes, what would then become apparent?\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nIf anyone can answer this question instantly, his eyes will be like a meteor\nand his mind like a flash of lightning.\n\nWhen the hubless wheel turns, Even the master would be at a loss what to do,\nIt turns above heaven and beneath earth, South, north, east, and west.\n\nCASE 9. DAITSU CHISHO BUDDHA\n\nA monk asked Seijo, \"Daitsu Chisho Buddha did zazen (meditated) for ten kalpas\nin a Meditation Hall, could not realize the highest truth, and so could not\nbecome fully emancipated. Why was this?\" Seijo said, \"Your question is a very\nappropriate one!\" The monk asked again, \"Why did he not attain Buddhahood by\ndoing zazen in the Meditation Hall?\" Seijo replied, \"Because he did not.\"\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nYou may know the Old Indian, but you are not allowed to have an understanding\nof Him. If an ordinary man attains enlightenment, he is a sage. When the sage\nis concerned about an understanding, he is only an ordinary man.\n\nRather than putting the body to rest, let the heart rest. When the mind is\nrealized, then one need not worry about the body. If the mind and the body\nhave completely become one, This is the perfect life of sage, and praise is\nutterly meaningless.\n\nCASE 10. SOZAN AND POOR SEIZAI\n\nA monk named Seizai said to Sozan, \"I am alone and poor. I beg my teacher to\nbestow upon me the alms of salvation.\" Sozan said, \"Acarya Seizai!\" \"Yes,\nSir?\" replied Seizai. Sozan said, \"Someone has drunk three bowls of the wine\nof Haku of Seigen, but says that he has not yet even moistened his lips.\"\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nSeizai overplayed his hand. Then what is his real state of mind? Sozan with\nhis one eye sees through the recesses of his mind and comprehends what he\nreally meant. However this may be so, where did Acarya Seizai drink the wine?\n\nThe poorest like Hanzen, His spirit like that of Kou. He could barely make his\nliving, And yet wishes to rival the wealthiest.\n\nCASE 11. JOSHU'S HERMIT\n\nJoshu went to a hermit's and asked, \"What's up? What's up?\"(=\"Have you any\nZen?\") The hermit lifted up his fist. Joshu said, \"The water is too shallow to\nanchor here,\" and went away. Joshu visited the hermit once again a few days\nlater and said, \"What's up? What's up?\" The hermit raised his fist again. Then\nJoshu said, \"Well given, well taken, well killed, well saved.\" And he bowed to\nthe hermit.\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nThe raised fist was the same both times. Why was one accepted, the other\nrejected? Just say, where is the confusion between the two? If you can answer\nthis by a word of true comprehension, then you realize that Joshu's tongue has\nno bone and that he can absolutely freely use it. Even though this is so, the\nhermit might have seen through Joshu both times. If you wonder whether the\nfirst hermit be superior (or inferior) to the second, then you have no one\neye.\n\nHis eye is a meteor, Zen's movement is like lightning. The sword that kills\nthe man, is the sword that saves the man.\n\nCASE 12. ZUIGAN CALLS HIMSELF \"MASTER\"\n\nEvery day Zuigan used to call out to himself, \"Master!\" and then he answered\nhimself, \"Yes, Sir!\" And he added, \"Awake, Awake!\" and then answered, \"Yes,\nSir! Yes, Sir!\" \"From now onwards, do not be deceived by others!\" \"No, Sir! I\nwill not, Sir!\"\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nThe master, Zuigan, sells out and buys himself. He has a lot of puppets of\ngods and devils that he plays with. Why is this so? With one mask he asked,\nand with another he answered. With another mask he said, \"Awake!\" and another,\n\"Don't be cheated by others!\" If you adhere to any one of these, you are\ntotally mistaken. If, however, you imitate Zuigan, then all these are no other\nthan the fox's disguises.\n\nSome who search the Way of Zen do not realize true self, For they recognize\nonly the ego-soul. This ego-soul is the seed of birth and death, Foolish\npeople take it for the true original self.\n\nCASE 13. TOKUSAN'S BOWL\n\nOne day Tokusan came to the dining room from the Meditation Hall, holding his\nbowl. Seppo saw him coming and asked, \"The dinner drum is not yet beaten.\nWhere are you going with your bowl?\n\nTokusan went back at once to his room. Seppo told about this incident to\nGanto, who said, \"Tokusan as he is, has not penetrated into the ultimate truth\nof Zen.\"\n\nTokusan heard of this and sent an acolyte to ask Ganto to come to him. \"I have\nheard,\" told Tokusan, \"you are not approving my Zen.\" Ganto whispered to\nTokusan what he meant. Tokusan said nothing, leaving Ganto there.\n\nNext day, ascending the rostrum, Tokusan delivered an entirely different\nsermon to the monks. Ganto went forward in the Hall, clapped his hands,\nlaughed and said, \"What a happy thing! The old man has got hold of the\nultimate truth of Zen. From now on, no one in heaven and on earth can surpass\nhim.\"\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nAs for the ultimate truth of Zen, neither Tokusan nor Ganto even dreamt of\nsuch a thing. When you look into the matter, they are only a set of dummies\nhow about puppets- dummies sounds like stupid..\n\nWhoever understands the first truth Understands the ultimate truth. The last\nand the first Are they not one and the same?\n\nCASE 14. NANSEN CUTS THE CAT IN TWO\n\nNansen saw the monks of the eastern and western halls fighting over a baby\ncat. He seized the cat and said, \"If (any of) you can say (a word of Zen), you\ncan spare the cat. Otherwise I will kill it.\" No one could answer. So Nansen\ncut the cat in two .\n\nThat evening Joshu returned and Nansen told him what had happened. Joshu\nthereupon took off his sandals and, placing them on his head, walked away.\nNansen said, \"If only you had been there, you could have saved the cat.\"\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nWhy did Joshu put his sandals on his head? If you can answer this question\nwith one word, you understand Nansen's efforts. If not, you are utterly in\ndanger.\n\nHad Joshu been there, The opposite would have been done. Joshu would have\nsnatched the knife, And Nansen would have begged for his life.\n\nCASE 15. TOZAN'S SIXTY BLOWS\n\nTozan went to Un-mon and Un-mon asked him where he had come from. Tozan\nanswered, \"From Sato!\" Then Un-mon asked, \"Where were you then during the\nSummer?\" Tozan answered, \"At Hoji Temple in Konan Province.\" Un-mon further\nasked Tozan, \"When did you leave there?\" Tozan replied, \"I left on August 25.\"\nUn-mon told Tozan, \"You deserve 60 blows, but I will forgive you today!\"\n\nThe next day Tozan knelt and deeply bowed to Un-mon and said, \"Yesterday you\nforgave me the 60 blows, but I still do not understand in what respect I was\nwrong.\" Then Un mon told Tozan, \"You are really a good-for-nothing rice eater!\nNo wonder you wandered around Konan and Kosei for nothing!\" At this very\nmoment, Tozan was awakened.\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nUn-mon had Tozan feed on the genuine fodder of Zen, showed him the one way of\nliving activity, and helped him from becoming extinct. All night long Tozan\nswam in the waves of Yes and No until he got nowhere. When the dawn broke,\nagain Tozan went to Un mon to be awakened. After all Tozan was not so\nseasoned. Now I will ask you: Did Tozan deserve 60 blows? If you say Yes, then\nnot only Tozan, but everyone also deserves 60 blows! If you say No, Un-mon is\na swindler. If therefore you understand this clearly, Tozan and you breathe\nthe same air!\n\nThe lion roughly teaches her cubs, She kicks them away and the cubs jump. Un-\nmon's thrown words hit right on Tozan's heart, While Un-mon's first arrow is\nlight, the second arrow hits deep.\n\nCASE 16. UN-MON'S SEVEN-FOLD ROBE\n\nUn-mon said, \"The world is vast and wide; for what is it you put on your\nseven-piece robe at the sound of the bell?\"\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nWhen one meditates and studies Zen, one extinguishes the attachment to sound\nand color. Even though some have attained enlightenment by hearing a sound, or\nan awakening by seeing a color, these are ordinary matters. Those who intend\nto master Zen freely master sounds or colors, see clearly the nature of things\nand every activity of mind. Even though this is so, now tell me: Does the\nsound come to the ear, or does the ear go to the sound? But when both sound\nand silence are forgotten, what would you call this state? If you listen with\nyour ear, it is hard to hear truly, but if you listen with your eye, then you\nbegin to hear properly.\n\nIf you are awakened, all things are one and the same, If you are not awakened,\nall things are varied and distinguished. If you are not awakened, all things\nare one and the same, If you are awakened, all things are varied and\ndistinguished.\n\nCASE 17. ECHU'S THREE CALLS\n\nEchu, called Kokushi, the teacher of the emperor, called his attendant, Oshin,\nthree times and three times Oshin answered, \"Yes!\" Kokushi said, \"I thought\nthat I had offended you, but in reality you offended me!\"\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nKokushi called Oshin three times. His tongue fell to the ground (from talking\ntoo much). Oshin answered three times and revealed his harmony with the Tao.\nEchu, getting old and lonely, attempted even to hold the cow's head down to\nfeed on the grass. Oshin did not trouble to show his Zen, for his satisfied\nstomach had no desire to eat. When the nation is prosperous, everyone is too\nproud (to eat plain food), now just say who offended which one?\n\nWhen prison canga is iron and has no hole, (Echu's) followers have neither\npeace nor rest. When you intend to uphold the teaching of Zen, You must climb\na mountain of swords with bare feet.\n\nCASE 18. TOZAN'S THREE POUNDS OF FLAX\n\nA monk asked Tozan, \"What is the Buddha?\" Tozan answered, \"Three pounds of\nflax!\"\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nTozan's Zen is like a clam. When the two halves of the shell open, you can see\nthe whole inside. However, now tell me, \"What is Tozan's real insides?\"\n\nJust \"Three pounds of flax!\" pops up, His words are close, and yet his heart\nis closer. Anyone who explains this or that, yes and no, is himself the man of\nyes and no.\n\nCASE 19. NANSEN'S ORDINARY MIND\n\nJoshu asked Nansen, \"What is the Way?\" Nansen answered, \"Your ordinary mind--\nthat is the Way.\" Joshu said, \"Can it be grasped (for study)?\" Nansen replied,\n\"The more you pursue, the more does it slip away.\" Joshu asked once more, \"How\ncan you know it is the Way?\" Nansen responded, \"The Way does not belong to\nknowledge, nor does it belong to non knowledge. Knowledge is illusion. Non\nknowledge is beyond discrimination. When you get to this Way without doubt,\nyou are free like the vastness of space, an unfathomable void, so how can you\nexplain it by yes or no?\" Upon hearing this, Joshu was awakened.\n\nMumon's Comment:\n\nThe question Joshu asked Nansen was dissolved by a stroke. After being\nenlightened, Joshu must further his pursuit 30 more years to exhaust that\nmeaning.\n\nHundred flowers in Spring, the moon in Autumn, The cool wind in Summer and\nWinter's snow. If your mind is not clouded with things, You are happy at any\ntime.\n\nCASE 20. SHOGEN'S STRONG MAN\n\nShogen said,\"Why is it that a man of strength cannot lift up his own legs and\nstand up (for Zen)?\" And again, \"It is not with our tongue that we speak.\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nShogen said it by turning his heart inside out, and no one was there to\nreceive it. If anyone should comprehend Shogen, then come to me and receive my\nblows. To know the genuine gold, you must see it through fire.\n\nRaising my foot I turn upside down the Scented Ocean, Bowing my head I look\ndown on the Four Dhyana Heavens. Such a body of full strength has no place to\nrest, Please finish this verse yourself!\n\nCASE 21. UN-MON'S DRIED DUNG\n\nA monk asked Un-mon,\"What is Buddha?\" Un-mon answered him, \"Dried dung.\"\n\nMumon's Comments\n\nWe must say that being so poor, Un-mon cannot appreciate plain food, or he is\nso busy that he cannot even scribble properly. He is disposed to support his\nschool with dry dung. Look at how devastated the Buddhist teaching has been!\n\nLightning flashes, Sparks of striking flint. In a blink of your eyes, You have\npassed by (and missed it).\n\nCASE 22. KASHAPA'S FLAG POLE\n\nAnanda asked Maha Kashapa, \"Buddha gave you the golden woven robe of\nsuccessorship. What else did he give you?\" Kashapa said, \"Ananda!\" \"Yes!\"\nanswered Ananda. \"Knock down the flagpole at the gate!\" said Kashapa.\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nIf you can give a \"turning word\" (a momentous word for awakening), you will\nsee the meeting at Mount Grdhrahuta? still in session. If not, no matter how\nmuch you make struggles to study from the age of Vipasyin, you cannot attain\nenlightenment.\n\nHow is Ananda's question, compared to Kashapa's answer of heart. How many\npeople have since then opened their eyes. Elder brother calls and younger\nbrother answers--the family disgrace. This spring does not belong to Yin and\nYang.\n\nCASE 23. ENO'S GOOD AND EVIL\n\nEno, the sixth patriarch, was pursued by Monk Emyo up to Daiyurei. The\npatriarch, seeing Emyo coming, laid the robe and the bowl on a rock, and said\nto him, \"This robe represents the faith. Is it to be fought for by force? You\nmay take them now.\" Emyo went to move the bowl and the robe and yet they were\nas heavy as mountains. He could not move them. Hesitating and trembling, Emyo\nasked the patriarch, \"I come for the teaching, not for the robe. Please\nenlighten me!\" The patriarch said, \"What is primordially Emyo (i.e., your true\nself), if you do not think this is good nor do you think this is evil?\" At\nthat moment Emyo was greatly awakened. His whole body was covered with sweat.\nEmyo cried, bowed, and said, \"Is there or is there not any other (deep)\nsignificance (in Zen) than your secret words and teachings a minute ago?\" The\npatriarch answered, \"What I have told you is no secret at all. Once you have\nrealized your own true self, the depth (in Zen) rather belongs to you!\" Emyo\nsaid, \"When I was at Obai with the other monks, I never realized what my true\nself was. Now you have dispersed the clouds of my ignorance to realize it,\njust like a man capable of discerning warm and cold by tasting water. From now\non you are my teacher!\" The patriarch said, \"We both have Obai for our\nteacher. Guard your own self!\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nWe should say that the sixth patriarch was in an emergency. This revelation of\nhis, however, resembles the deed of an overly protective grandmother, who\npeeled a fresh lichi (a dessert fruit), removed its stone and put it to her\ngrandchild's mouth ready for him to swallow.\n\nYou describe it in vain, you picture it to no avail, Praising it is useless,\ncease to worry about it at all. It is your true self, it has nowhere to hide,\nEven if the universe is annihilated, it is not destroyed.\n\nCASE. 24 FUKETSU'S SILENCE AND WORDS\n\nA monk asked Fuketsu, \"Without words or without silence transgressing, how can\none be unmistakably one with the universe?\" Fuketsu said, \"I often think of\nMarch in Konan (Southern China). The birds sing among hundreds of flagrant\nflowers.\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nFuketsu's mind was quick as lightning, snatching the road and walking on it.\nRegrettably Fuketsu was not able to sit on the words of the \"ancestors.\" If\nanyone should penetrate into this, he would be absolutely free. Without words,\nwithout phrases, now say what Zen is.\n\nFuketsu did not say such a fine phrase, Without uttering words, he already let\nit be known. If Fuketsu had become talkative, You do not know what to do.\n\nCASE 25. KYOZAN'S SERMON FROM THE THIRD SEAT\n\nIn a dream Kyozan went to Maitreya's Pure Land and sat in the third seat. A\nmonk there beat the gavel and said, \"Today the one in the third seat will give\na sermon.\" Kyozan arose, hit the gavel and said,\"The truth of Mahayana is\nbeyond any verbal expression! Listen, listen!\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nYou tell me, did Kyozan preach, or did he not? If he opens his mouth, he is\nlost. If he seals his mouth, he is lost, too. Whether he opens or seals his\nmouth, Kyozan is 108 thousand miles away from truth.\n\nIn the bright daylight, And yet in a dream he talks a dream. Indeed a\npossessed word, a possessed word, He is deceiving the entire crowd.\n\nCASE 26. TWO MONKS ROLL UP THE BLINDS\n\nHogen of Seiryo came to the hall to speak to the monks before the midday meal.\nHe pointed with his finger to the bamboo blinds. At this moment two monks rose\nand rolled the blinds up. Hogen observed, \"One has it, the other hasn't it.\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nNow tell me, which one has it and which one has not? If any one of you has one\neye, he will see through the failure on Hogen of Seiryo. However, never be\nconcerned about the gain or the loss.\n\nWhen the blinds are rolled up, the great sky is bright and clear, The great\nsky is not yet in accord with Zen. It's better to throw everything away from\nthe sky, And make sure to have not even a draft blow through.\n\nCASE 27. NANSEN'S NO MIND, NO BUDDHA\n\nA monk asked Nansen, \"Is there any teaching no master has ever preached\nbefore?\" Nansen replied, \"Yes, there is.\" \"What is it?\" asked the monk. Nansen\nanswered, \"It is not mind, it is not Buddha, it is not things.\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nBeing asked a question, Nansen gave away his entire treasure (words) and\nsuffered a run of bad luck.\n\nNansen was too kind and lost his treasure, Verily words have no power. Even if\na mountain may become a blue ocean, Nansen will never make it comprehensible\nto you.\n\nCASE 28. RYUTAN'S CANDLE\n\nOne night Tokusan went to Ryutan to ask for his teaching. After Tokusan's many\nquestions, Ryutan said to Tokusan at last, \"It is late. Why don't you retire?\"\nSo Tokusan bowed, lifted the screen and was ready to go out, observing, \"It is\nvery dark outside.\" Ryutan lit a candle and offered it to Tokusan. Just as\nTokusan received it, Ryutan blew it out. At that moment the mind of Tokusan\nwas opened. \"What have you realized?\" asked Ryutan to Tokusan, who replied,\n\"From now on I will not doubt what you have said.\"\n\nThe next day Ryutan ascended the rostrum and declared to the monks, \"Among you\nthere is one monk whose teeth are like the sword tree, his mouth is like the\nblood bowl. Strike him with a stick, he won't turn his head to look at you.\nSome day he will climb the highest peaks and carry out my teaching there.\"\n\nOn that day, in front of the lecture hall, Tokusan burned to ashes his\ncommentaries on the sutras and declared, \"In comparison to this awareness, all\nthe most profound teachings are like a single hair in vast space. However deep\nthe complicated knowledge of the world, compared to this enlightenment it is\nlike one drop of water in the ocean.\" Then he left the monastery.\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nBefore Tokusan passed through the barrier, his mind was eager, his mouth was\nanxious, with a purpose in his mind, he went south, to refute the doctrine of\n\"A special transmission outside the sutras.\" When he got on the road to Reishu\n(near Ryutan's monastery) he asked an old woman to let him have something to\n\"point his mind\" (literally a snack, then something to put the mind at ease at\nthe same time).The old woman asked Tokusan, \"What is all that writing you are\ncarrying?\" Tokusan replied, \"That's the manuscript of my notes and commentary\non the Diamond Sutra.\" Then the old woman said, \"That Sutra says, the past\nmind cannot be held, the present mind cannot be held, the future mind cannot\nbe held. All of them are but unreal and illusory. You wish to have some\nrefreshments. Well then, with which of your minds do you want to have the\nrefreshments?\" Tokusan found himself quite dumb. Finally he asked the woman,\n\"Do you know of any Zen master around here?\" \"About five li away lives\nRyutan,\" said she. Tokusan arrived at Ryutan's monastery with all humility,\nquite different from when he had started his journey. Ryutan in turn was so\nkind he forgot his own dignity. It was like pouring muddy water over a drunken\nman to sober him. After all, it was an unnecessary comedy.\n\nRather than hearing the name, seeing the face is better, Rather than seeing\nthe face, hearing the name is better. But how much you help the nostrils, Look\nwhat you have done to the eyes!\n\nCASE 29. ENO'S FLAG\n\nThe wind was flapping a temple flag, and two monks were arguing about the\nflag. One said, \"The flag is moving.\" The other said, \"the wind is moving.\"\nThey could not agree, no matter how hard they debated. The sixth patriarch,\nEno, happened to come by and said, \"Not the wind, not the flag. It is the mind\nthat is moving!\" The two monks were struck with awe.\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nIt is not the wind that moves, it is not the flag that moves, it is not the\nmind that moves. How shall we understand the sixth patriarch? If you gain an\nintimate grasp of its meaning, you will see how the two monks, intending to\nbuy iron, got gold. The patriarch could not repress his compassion for the two\nmonks, and so we have this disgraceful scene.\n\nWind, flag, and mind moves, All confirmed as guilty of error. Only we know our\nmouth is opened, we do not know our speech went wrong.\n\nCASE 30. BASO'S VERY MIND\n\nDaibai asked Baso, What is the Buddha?\" Baso answered, \"The mind is the\nBuddha.\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nIf you fully understand Baso's meaning, you are wearing Buddha's clothes,\neating Buddha's food, speaking Buddha's words, doing Buddha's deeds, that is\nto say, you are Buddha himself. But Baso misled not a few people into erroring\nthe principles of Zen. He does not realize that if we explain the word\n\"Buddha\" we must rinse our mouths for three days afterwards. If he is a man of\nunderstanding, he would cover his ears and run away hearing Baso say, \"The\nmind is the Buddha!\"\n\nUnder blue sky, in bright sunlight, One need not search around, Asking around\nwhat Buddha is, is liking the stolen goods in one's pocket and declaring\noneself innocent.\n\nCASE 31. JOSHU INVESTIGATES AN OLD WOMAN\n\nA (travelling) monk asked an old woman the way to Taizan. The old woman said,\n\"Go straight ahead.\" When the monk proceeded a few steps, she said to herself,\n\"This monk with such spirit also goes off like that!\" Afterwards, another monk\ntold Joshu about this, and Joshu said, \"Wait until I go and investigate the\nold woman.\" The next day off Joshu went and asked the same question and the\nold woman gave the same answer. Upon his return, Joshu told the congregation\nof monks, \"I have investigated the old woman of Taizan.\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nThe old woman sat in the tent and planned the campaign, but she did not know\nthat there was the famous bandit who knew how to take the enemy commander\nprisoner. Old Joshu sneaked into her tent and menaced her fortress, but he\nwasn't a real general. Indeed both had their faults. Now I would like to ask\nyou: \"What was the point of Joshu's investigating the old woman?\"\n\nThe question was the same, The answer was the same. Sand in the rice, Thorns\nin the mud.\n\nCASE 32. A \"PAGAN\" ASKS BUDDHA\n\nA \"pagan\" asked Buddha, \"With words, with silence, will you tell me (the\nWay)?\" Buddha silently kept meditating. The \"pagan\" bowed and thanked the\nBuddha, saying, \"With the compassion you have cleared away the clouds of my\nmind and have made me enter into the awakening.\" After he left, Ananda asked\nthe Buddha what he had attained. The Buddha said, \"A good horse runs even a\nshadow of the whip.\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nAnanda was Buddha's disciple but his understanding was not like that pagan.\nNow tell me, \"How afar are the disciple and the non-disciple?\"\n\nTreading on the sharp edge of a sword, Running over jagged ice. Not climbing\non the ladder, Letting your hands off the cliff.\n\nCASE 33. NEITHER MIND NOR BUDDHA\n\nA monk asked Baso, \"What is the Buddha?\" Baso replied, \"Not mind, not Buddha.\"\n\nMumon's Comments\n\nIf anyone understands what Baso said, he has mastered Zen.\n\nIf you meet a sword master on the road, give him the sword. Unless you meet a\npoet on the road, do not offer a poem. If you meet a man, tell him the three\nquarters of the Way, and never tell him the rest.\n\nCASE 34. NANSEN'S NO WAY\n\nNansen said, \"Mind is not Buddha. Knowledge is not the Way.\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nGrowing old, Nansen forgot to be ashamed. With his stinking mouth open he\nspread the scandal of his own house (such as knowledge is not the Way) to\nothers. However, few appreciate their indebtedness to him.\n\nWhen the sky is clear the sun appears, when rain falls, the earth becomes\nmoistened. How wholeheartedly he explains, how few have faith in him and his\nwords.\n\nCASE 35. TWO SOULS\n\nGoso asked a monk, \"Sei, the Chinese girl, who was separated from her soul.\nWhich was the real Sei?\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nIf you obtain genuine awareness of reality, you will know that the soul passes\nfrom one husk to another as travellers lodged in an inn. But if you have not\nobtained the awareness, you should not run around in confusion when the four\nelements are suddenly ready to become separated (i.e., to die), like a crab\nwith its seven arms and eight legs thrown into the boiling water. Never say\nthat I did not warn you.\n\nThe moon in the clouds is one and the same, Valleys and mountains are various.\nFortunes above fortunes, Is it one, or is it two?\n\nCASE 36. GOSO'S NO WORDS, NO SILENCE\n\nGoso said, \"When you meet a Man of the Way on the road, greet him not with\nwords, nor with silence. Tell me, how will you greet him?\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nIf you can answer Goso exactly, it will be extremely heartening. If you cannot\nanswer properly yet, then you must do your best to watch out everything.\n\nMeeting the man of the Way on the road, Greeting him not with words, nor with\nsilence. Give him an uppercut, Then he will understand you at once.\n\nCASE 37. JOSHU'S OAK TREE IN THE GARDEN\n\nA monk asked Joshu, \"With what intention did Bodhidharma come to China?\" Joshu\nanswered, \"The oak tree in the front garden.\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nIf you grasp Joshu's answer precisely, there is no Shakyamuni Buddha before\nyou and no Maitreya Buddha after you.\n\nWords do not express fact, Phrases do not reveal the delicate motion of mind.\nHe who accepts words is lost, He who adheres to phrases is deluded.\n\nCASE 38. GOSO'S BUFFALO\n\nGoso asked, \"A water buffalo goes out of his \"enclosure.\" The head, the horns,\nand the four legs go through, but why doesn't the tail, too?\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nIf you can open your one eye (to the question) and say an awakening word, you\nwill be able to repay the Four Obligations and help the Three Bhava being\nsaved. If you still have not gotten it, take a close look on the tail and\nawake yourself.\n\nIf the buffalo goes through, he will fall into the abyss, If he retreats into\nthe enclosure, he will be butchered. This little bit of a tail, that is a\nstrange thing indeed!\n\nCASE 39. UN-MON AND TRAP INTO WORDS\n\nAs soon as a monk stated Un-mon, \"The radiance of the Buddha quietly and\nrestlessly illuminates the whole universe\", Un-mon asked him, \"Are these you\nare reciting not the words of Chosetzu Shusai?\" The monk replied, \"Yes, they\nare.\" Un-mon said, \"You are trapped in words!\" Afterwards Shishin brought up\nthe matter once more and said, \"Tell me, how was the monk trapped in words?\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nIf you are able to grasp Un-mon's unapproachable accomplishments and follow\nthrough the monk's corruption (of being trapped into words), you will be the\nleader of humans and Devas. If not, you cannot even save yourself.\n\nA fish meets the fishhook in a rapid stream, Being too greedy for the bait,\nthe fish wants to bite. Once his mouth widely opens, His life is already lost.\n\nCASE 40. KICKING THE DRINKING WATER JAR\n\nDuring his stay under Master Hyakujo, Isan was a cooking monk. As Master\nHyakujo wished to send a monk to found the new monastery called the Great\nMount I, Maser Hyakujo told the chief monk and all other monks that he would\nchoose the one who would demonstrate himself as the best among them. Then\nMaster Hyakujo brought out a drinking water jar, put it down and said, \"You\ncannot call it a water jar. Then, what will you call it?\" The chief monk said,\n\"One cannot call it a wooden stick.\" Then, when Master Hyakujo turned to Isan,\nIsan kicked the jar and walked away. Master Hyakujo laughed and said, \"The\nchief monk lost it to Isan.\" He made Isan the founder of the Great I-san\nMonastery.\n\nMumon's comments:\n\nMaster Isan had indeed rare courage, but he could not jump out of Master\nHyakujo's trap. After examination of the outcome, Isan took over the heavier\nburden for the easier job. Why? Look, Isan took off the cook's headband and\nput himself in steel cuffs (of the founder of the monastery).\n\nThrowing away strainers and cooking spoon,\n\nIsan kicks the jar and settles the disputes.\n\nUnhindered by the multiple hurdles,\n\nHe gives a kick on the toe,\n\nEven Buddha becomes pieces.\n\nCASE 41. BODHIDHARMA'S PEACE OF MIND\n\nBoddhidharma sit facing the stone wall. The Second Patriarch, Suika, stood\nlong in the thick snow. Finally, he severed his own arm and presented it to\nBodhidharma. He said, \"Your student cannot pacify his mind. You, the First\nPatriarch, please, give me peace of mind!\" The First Patriarch replied, \"Bring\nthat mind, I will calm it down!\" The Second Patriarch said, \"I search for it\neverywhere, but I cannot find it!\" Boddhidharma replied, \"I have already\npacified it for you!\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nThat toothless old chap from India proudly travelled ten thousand li over the\nocean (to China). This was indeed as if he deliberately raised waves where\nthere was no wave. At last, he got only one disciple, who was maimed by\ncutting off his own arm. Alas, he was a fool indeed.\n\nThe First Patriarch from India taught straight forward,\n\nA series of all the troubles has initiated from him.\n\nThe one who disturbed the calm world,\n\nIs Boddhidharma, you indeed!\n\nCASE 42. A WOMAN COMES OUT OF MEDITATION\n\nWhen the wisest Boddhisattva Manjusuri, who is supposed to be next in order to\nShakyamuni Buddha, found that the Buddha' gathering was adjourned and each was\ngoing back to his/her land. Observing one woman still deep in meditation near\nShakyamuni, Manjusuri properly bowed and asked Shakyamuni Buddha, \"That woman\nhas been able to reach that state of enlightenment and why have I not?\"\nShakyamuni replied, \"Bring her from the samadhi and ask her yourself!\"\nManjusuri went round the woman three times and snapped his fingers and yet she\nwas undisturbed in meditation. So Manjusuri held her high up in his hand and\nbrought her to the first of three meditative heavens (totally detached from\nany lust) and exhausted all his mystical powers in vain (to awaken her).\nObserving this, Shakyamuni said, \"Even a hundred thousand Manjusris could not\nawaken her from samadi. There resides Mo-myo (Avidya) Boddhisattva, the lowest\nof all, below this place past twelve hundred million lands. He alone can raise\nher from her deep meditation.\" No sooner had the Shakyamuni spoken than that\nBoddhisattva sprang up out of the earth, bowed and paid his homage to\nShakyamuni. By Shakyamuni order, Mo-myo Boddhisattva snapped his fingers.\nInstantly the woman came out of meditation and stood up.\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nThe old chap, Shakyamuni, is extraordinary indeed, able to produce such a\nvillage theatre stage. Now then, tell me: \"Why was Manjusri, the highest and\nwisest of the seven Boddhisattva, unable to bring her out of meditation? Why\nwas Mo-myo Boddhisattva, the lowest of all, able to do so? Should you obtain\nand live this complete understanding of it, you will attain the great samadi\nwithin this mundane world of delusion and attachment.\"\n\nWhether the one who could bring her out of meditation, or the other who could\nnot,\n\nBoth of them obtained freedom.\n\nThe one wore the mask of god, the other, a devil's mask in that theatre,\n\nEven the failure is artistic indeed.\n\nCASE 43. SHUZAN'S BAMBOO SPATULA\n\nMaster Shuzan held out his bamboo spatula and asked, \"If you call this a\nbamboo spatula, you give umbrage (to the principle of Zen). If you call this\nno bamboo spatula, you violate the law (of common-sense). What will all of you\ncall this?\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nShould you call this a bamboo spatula, you would give umbrage. Should you call\nthis no bamboo spatula, you would betray the law. Both to speak out will not\ndo, and no word will be of any use either. Quickly say, quickly say!\"\n\nBringing out the bamboo spatula,\n\nShuzan demanded a life or death order.\n\nBeing put to either the umbrage, or the betrayal,\n\nEven Buddha and Patriarchs would beg for their lives.\n\nCASE 44. BASHO'S STAFF\n\nMaster Basho said to his disciples, \"If you have the staff, I will give it to\nyou. If you have no staff, I will take it away from you!\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nThis staff helps you to cross the river with the shattered bridge. The staff\nleads you back to your village in the moonless dark night. If you call it the\nstaff, then you will go right into hell like an arrow.\n\nWhether one is deep or shallow, It lies in the palm of the hand which holds\nthe staff. The staff supports the heaven and maintains the earth, Wherever the\nstaff freely goes, It will propagate the true teaching.\n\nCASE 45. WHO IS HE?\n\nTo Tozan, Master Hoen the Fifth Patriarch said, \"Shakyamuni and Maitreya\nBoddhisattva, both are His slaves. Well, tell me: Who is He?\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nShould you be able to clearly realize who he is, it would be as if you met\nyour own father at the crossroads, as you do not have to ask your own father\nwho he is.\n\nDo not use another's bow and arrow.\n\nDo not ride somebody else's horse.\n\nDo not discuss someone else's faults.\n\nDo not try to know some other person's business.\n\nCASE 46. PROCEED BEYOND THE TOP OF THE 100 FOOT HIGH POLE\n\nMaster Sekiso said, \"You are at the top of the 100 foot high pole. How will\nyou make a step further?\" Another Zen Master of Ancient Times said, \"One who\nsits on top of the 100 foot pole has not quite attained true enlightenment.\nMake another step forward from the top of the pole and throw one's own body\ninto the 100,000 universes.\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nShould there be any who is able to step forward from the top of the 100 foot\npole and hurl one's whole body into the entire universe, this person may call\noneself a Buddha. Nevertheless, how can one step forward from the top of the\n100 foot pole? Know thyself!\n\nShould one be content and settle on top of the 100,000 foot pole,\n\nOne will harm the third eye,\n\nAnd will even misread the marks on the scale.\n\nShould one throw oneself and be able to renounce one's life,\n\nLike one blind person leading all other blind persons,\n\nOne will be in absolute freedom (unattached from the eyes).\n\nCASE 47. TOSOTSU'S THREE BARRIERS\n\nMaster Tosotsu, setting up the three barriers, always tried the pursuer of the\nWay: \"To search for the Way, the Zen student tries to grasp one's own nature\nand be enlightened.\" \"Now where is your true nature?\" Secondly, \"Once having\ngrasped one's own nature, one is free from birth and death. If then, one's\neyeballs have dropped dead, how can one be free from life?\" Thirdly, \"Being\nfree from birth and death, one instantly knows where to go after death.\"\n\"Being dead and the body dispersed into the four elements, where then does one\ngo?\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nWhoever can pass these three barriers will be a master anywhere. Whatever\nhappens, this person should be able to become the founder of Zen. Should one\nbe not yet capable of answering these three questions, this person must\ndiligently chew them well to finally comprehend them. Humble meals fill one's\nstomach, and chewing them well, one will never starve.\n\nTo instantly realize is to see endless time.\n\nEndless time is this very moment.\n\nIf one sees through the thought of this very moment,\n\nAt this very moment, one can see through the one who sees through.\n\nCASE 48. THE ONE ROAD OF KEMPO\n\nA student monk asked Master Kempo, \"I understand that all Buddha of the whole\nuniverse enter the one road into Nirvana. Where is this one road? Kempo raised\nhis walking stick, drew the figure \"one\" and said, \"Here it is.\" Later, this\nmonk went to Umon to ask the question. Umon, turning around his fan, said,\n\"This fan will reach the thirty-third heaven and hit the nose of Sakra\nDevendra, the highest deity in these heavens. It is like the giant carp of the\nEastern Sea tipping over with its tail a rain cloud to have the rain pour\ndown.\"\n\nMumon's Comments:\n\nThe one master walks on the deep ocean and raises dust. The other, standing on\nthe tip of the high mountain, fills the heaven with white waves. The one holds\nthe point, while the other liberates everything, together each supports the\nprofound teaching with one hand. Kempo and Umon are dangerous, like two\nequally powerful camels colliding. No one in the world equals them. Seen from\nthe truth, however, even Kempo and Mumon did not know where this one road\nreally is.\n\nThey reach the goal before taking the first step.\n\nThey complete the speech before their tongue moves.\n\nEven if they have had foresight long before, The origin of the road lies way\nahead of their foresight.\n\nTHE EPILOGUE BY MUMON\n\nThe words and the actions left by Buddha and the patriarchs in these forty-\neight Ko-ans are as precise as laws and judgements, and therein nothing\nsuperfluous is contained. They turn the student monk's brain upside down and\nhollow out his eyeballs. They are here in order that each one of you will\nimmediately grasp truth and must not try to obtain it vicariously from others.\nShould there be anyone who thoroughly appropriates everything, the person\nwould seize the true meaning of all forty-eight Ko-ans, as listening to a\nsmall portion of them. To such a person, there is no gate to enlightenment,\nnor steps to the search. He may go through the gate with no concern of the\ngatekeepers, as Gensha said, \"It is the gateless that is every entrance to\nrealization, and to be aimless is the genuine aim of the master.\" Haku-un also\nsaid, \"Why can one not go through this very gate, although it is so obvious?\"\nSuch stories are indeed as meaningless as mixing milk with red clay. If you\ncan pass these forty-eight Ko-ans through the Gateless Gate, you will step on\nme Mumon under your foot. If you cannot pass through the Gateless Gate, you\nwill betray yourself. As often said, it is easy to illuminate the realization\nthat everything is empty, but it is difficult indeed to elucidate the\nknowledge of distinctions. If you are able to edify the wisdom of differences,\nthe universe will be well at peace.\n\nACUPUNCTURE (ADMONITIONS) FOR ZEN\n\nAnyone rigorously following the laws and regulations is tieing oneself without\nropes. Whoever licenses oneself to do anything, following one's desire, is a\nheretic and a member of the devil's army. Anyone who tries to maintain the\nmind serene alone is the wrong Zen through remaining merely silent (without\nthe use of Ko-an). Whoever does anything that is desired and forgets the world\nis to fall into a deep hole. Anyone who tries to be clear about everything and\nwill not allow to deceive oneself deliberately chains oneself with the\npillory. Whoever incessantly worries about good and evil has fallen into hell\n(the world of duality). Anyone who adheres to Buddhahood and Dharma is\npoisoned in the two Tetsusan, wondering around the peripheries of the\nuniverse. Any clever meditator, who, when attacked by delusion, insists that\nit is primarily empty, is one who plays with ghosts. Whoever, out of the blue,\nexclusively studies Zen meditation lives the monster's life (against Soto\nZen). Anyone who advances loses sight of Zen's principles, while anyone who\nretreats betrays Zen's teaching. Whoever neither advances nor retreats is a\ndead person merely breathing. Say how one ought to proceed and practice the\nway of Zen. While one's lifetime, one must solve this cardinal problem. Do not\nsuffer the eternal returns of the chain of causality.\n\nOO-RYO-ENAN'S THREE BARRIERS\n\nWhich is the hand, my hand or Buddha's hand? Searching for it behind my back,\nI laugh wholeheartedly. My entire body was indeed that hand.\n\nWhich is the leg, my leg or the donkey's? It has already made a step even\nbefore lifting its leg. To walk all over the world, One must walk around,\nriding on Master Yogi's three legs (his Zen).\n\nEveryone has parents, and yet sees through to the tip of their previous life\nby themself. Prince Nada removed one of his bones and returned it to his\nfather (preaching for his father from his independent stand). According to an\nanecdote of Master Gunin, the Fifth Patriarch, he needed no karmic relation to\nhis father. (For in his previous life, he was the old Taoist Saisho. Gunin\nwent into a woman's womb to be born in this life in order to study under the\nFourth Patriarch Doshin.)\n\nAs mentioned before, Buddha's hand, the donkey's leg and karmic relations are\nthemselves neither Buddha, nor the way, nor Zen. Do not be afraid of the steep\nand dangerous Gateless Gate. Do not blame me for having planted a deep grudge\nin the student monks' minds.\n\nRecently, Master Mumon specially came to the Zuigan Monastery of Mount Shimei.\nAppraised the old and new Ko-ans, seated on a straw cushion, And cut off both\nmediocre men and enlightened persons' roads. Well then, how many dragons will\nrise with a roar?\n\nI would like to express my gratitude by writing a few lines in memory of\nMaster Mumon's special lectures to the general audience. (Master Soju)\n\nMOKO'S POSTSCRIPT\n\nBoddhidharma came from the West (India) and taught awakening to one's own\nnature to become a Buddha, not using the word, but directly pointing it out.\nIt is already cumbersome to directly point out one's nature and to become a\nBuddha is due to senility. Why are there barriers, being it is gateless? Mumon\nbecame notorious for being too kind, like an old woman's mind. As I, Muan,\nwrote my postscript, there ended up being forty nine cases. Even the slightest\ndeceit or lie should not be overlooked.\n\nAMBAN'S EPILOGUE\n\nMaster Mumon, the old Zen master, told forty-eight cases and criticized the\nold and the new Ko-ans. He is just like a famous old donut seller who told the\nbuyer to open his mouth and stacked the donuts in his mouth, so the customer\nneither could spit them out nor swallow them. Mumon thus annoyed everyone\nenough, so I, Amban, will fry for Master Mumon another donut in the hot\nsizzling oil by making the Gateless Gate the forty-nine cases and will show it\nto the world by following in Master Mumon's footsteps. I wonder how Master\nMumon will eat it? Should he be able to swallow it at once, a miracle will\noccur, like when the Shakyamuni gave a sermon, there will be full of light and\nthe earth moves. Should he fail to chew and swallow it, all these forty-eight\nKo-ans will turn into the fiery sands. Now, quickly answer it, quickly answer\nit.\n\nCASE 49.\n\nAccording to a sutra, Buddha said, \"Stop, stop. Do not speak. The ultimate\ntruth is to not even think.\n\nAmban's Comments:\n\nWhere did the so-called teaching come from? What is it that is unthinkable?\nHow is it that one cannot even think of it? Not only was Bukan talkative. So\nhad Buddha himself been a chatterbox. This old chap created dubious things,\nmade the descendants of one thousand one hundred generations completely caught\nin the entangled ropes and unable to raise their heads. So later appeared\nMumon and made those wonderful forty eight Ko ans, which cannot be scooped up\nby a spoon, nor can they ever be steamed for eating. How many people have\nmistook them for tasty meals? A bystander asked me, \"What is the ultimate\nconclusion?\" Putting his hands flat together, Amban said, \"Stop, stop. Do not\nspeak. The ultimate truth is to not even think!\" And hurriedly Amban added on\nthe top of \" to not even think\" one circle. Then, he showed it to the others,\nthat everything including all the sutras and Yuima's only gate is within this\ncircle.\n\nWhen anyone tells you fire is light, pay no attention.\n\nWhen a thief meets another on the street, they understand each other,\n\nand respond to a single word.\n\nEND.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
