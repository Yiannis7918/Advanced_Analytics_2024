Local bank branches have big AI\nambitions\n\nPublished Sat, Apr 13 20249:56 AM EDT\n\nKevin Williams\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Financial technology has already helped level the playing field for smaller banks competing against giants like Wells Fargo and Chase, and AI is being viewed as the next tech arms race for Main Street in keeping up with Wall Street.\n  * \u201cThe teller line, as we see it today, will eventually die,\u201d says one community bank CEO, who tells CNBC that the future branch will look more like \u201ca wall of screens.\u201d\n  * JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wrote in his annual letter to shareholders this week that AI will have vast implications for bank worker roles across its more than 300,000 employees.\n\nSdi Productions | E+ | Getty Images\n\nThe pandemic accelerated changes at big banks, where Chase and Wells Fargo\nalready have branches that look more like lounges than banks. But it\u2019s not\njust Wall Street-sized banks where AI is disrupting the way things works.\n\nSmall, independent branches are also following, and experts and executives say\nthey\u2019ll use their small size and agility to their advantage. The local bank\nbranch, with its traditional teller windows and long lines, will transform\ninto an AI-infused, customer-centric financial services center, aiming to beat\nthe big banks on the service that AI will allow them to provide customers.\n\n\u201cAs a small bank, your only value proposition is service. Nothing is\nproprietary anymore,\u201d said Christopher Naghibi, executive vice president and\nCEO of Irvine, California-based First Foundation Bank, which has 43 branches\nin five states. With just over $10 billion in assets, Naghibi helped shepherd\nFirst Foundation from a single branch in 2007 to its size today.\n\nNaghibi envisions community bank branches with fewer employees and more AI.\nThe employees would be freed to help customers reach their financial goals and\nnot be stuck answering basic questions about recent transactions and account\ninformation.\n\n\u201cThe teller line, as we see it today, will eventually die,\u201d he said.\n\nNaghibi isn\u2019t alone among bank CEOs contemplating the AI future for financial\nworkers and customer interactions.\n\nJamie Dimon, the veteran chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has written about\nartificial intelligence in his annual shareholder letters dating back to 2017.\nBut his latest letter, released on Monday, was notable not only for his AI\npredictions \u2014 he wrote it could be as transformational as the printing press,\nthe steam engine, electricity, computing and the internet \u2014 but also how he\nthinks the technology could impact the jobs of the bank\u2019s more than 310,000\nemployees.\n\n\u201cOver time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the potential to augment\nvirtually every job, as well as impact our workforce composition,\u201d Dimon\nwrote. \u201cIt may reduce certain job categories or roles, but it may create\nothers as well.\u201d\n\nMany of JPMorgan\u2019s AI ambitions are taking place behind the scenes rather than\nat the teller window \u2014 it now has more than 2,000 AI and machine learning\nemployees and data scientists working on 400 applications including fraud\ndetection, marketing and risk controls, Dimon said. The bank is also exploring\nthe use of generative AI in software engineering, customer service and ways to\nboost employee productivity.\n\nFor smaller banks, the customer interaction may be the critical application,\nwith AI freeing a bank\u2019s resources from answering routine questions..\n\n\u201cThis will be at the forefront of how we engage in service,\u201d Naghibi said.\n\u201cYou can ask AI, \u2018Hey, did this happen? Did this check clear? How many\npayments have I made to this person?\u2019 You\u2019ll get answers directly from AI.\u201d\n\nCustomers will be able to go in 24/7 with a special access technology and pay\nbills by touchscreens, send a wire at midnight, and see transactions updated\nin real-time. \u201cEffectively, a small bank\u2019s branch will be a wall of screens,\u201d\nhe said.\n\nSecurity will improve at transformed branches as paper money becomes less\nplentiful and more locked into machines. The AI will bring a lot more security\nto branches also, with plenty of cameras, biometrics used for access, and PIN\ncodes a thing of the past. It will also help in more extreme scenarios. \u201cIf\nsomeone has a weapon, AI can automatically see that it is a weapon, sense it,\nand prevent a problem,\u201d Naghibi said.\n\nJackie Verkuyl, chief administrative officer of the eight-branch BAC Community\nBank in Stockton, California, a commercial and consumer bank with over $800\nmillion deposits, says implementation of generative AI is already well\nunderway and transforming the small bank. \u201cThe AI is getting smarter every\nday,\u201d she said.\n\nBut while the corner bank will become an AI-infused financial services center,\nVerkuyl says generative AI will bring the same services to phones, far beyond\nthe capability of current apps. BAC uses an app called Smart Alac (an acronym\nfor All Access Connection), developed by San Francisco-based Agent IQ, which\nanswers customer questions and matches them with a BAC banker who becomes\ntheir assigned point of contact. \u201cThis allows community and regional banks to\nprovide self-service AI and have a relationship-based banking experience;\nevery customer has a primary point of contact,\u201d said Slaven Bilac, CEO of\nAgent IQ, a AI-powered customer support platform.\n\nAI distills all the questions that customers are asking Smart Alac and\nprovides a report to Verkuyl, allowing her to tailor the experience more. \u201cWe\nget lots and lots of questions about debit cards, so we created a whole menu\nthat customers can help themselves to,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cChase and Wells Fargo\u2019s advantage over BAC is the amount of data they have.\nWe can provide AI benefits without large amounts of know-how from BAC\u2019s team,\u201d\nBilac said.\n\nNot everyone in the industry is convinced.\n\nThe way a bank controls and shares large amounts of data with AI will be\ncritical to effective transformation, according to Ken Tumin, a senior analyst\nat LendingTree. Banks have to give AI access to enough data to be effective,\nfrom account disclosures to frequently asked questions. \u201cUnless a bank is\ncommitted to generating and maintaining high quality and comprehensive data,\nthe use of AI in customer service will likely result in more customers being\naggravated than pleased,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Independent Community Banking Association, a trade group for small banks,\ndoesn\u2019t think AI can outshine the human element in a relationship. While AI\nwill be a significant factor, \u201cit will never match the local knowledge and\npersonal relationships that are crucial to helping a first-time homebuyer get\na mortgage or helping a small business or farm finance its operations,\u201d said\nICBA assistant vice president and regulatory counsel Mickey Marshall.\n\nBut bankers like Naghibi believe AI will allow small banks to become more\ninvolved in their communities, and in effect, more human.\n\n\u201cRight now, getting branch managers to go out into the community and get\nbusiness is tough. We are not a large, important bank; people are not going to\ncome to us. You have to go out and build relationships,\u201d Naghibi said. \u201cIf\ngenerative AI is in place, you as a branch manager should be going to get\nbusiness.\u201d\n\nMultiple human and tech-centered connections serve as \u201ctouchpoints\u201d to the\nconsumer, Naghibi said, and \u201cthe more touchpoints the bank has in their\nfinancial lives, the more we can be involved in their lives. As a community\nbank, that is where the edge is.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommunity banking needs to change; every single one of my clients has my\nmobile number,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want untouchable and unreachable.\nMaking local bankers more accessible is the promise of AI.\u201d\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO4:3504:35\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy: AI is going to transform every customer experience that\nwe know\n\nSquawk Box\n\n## More In Technology Executive Council\n\nHow to identify an AI imposter in video, audio and text as deepfake technology\ngoes mainstream\n\nKevin Williams\n\nA super-intelligent AI doomsday is not where futurists see the world going\n\nKevin Williams\n\nWhy fear of AI making a job obsolete is the wrong way to think about a career\nfuture\n\nBob Violino\n\nRead More\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
