It fits 32 cans in less\nthan 4\" on the wall. The clear acrylic glass (in an off the shelf size) keeps\ncans visible so you know when you are running low, and automatically rotates\nolder cans to the front.\n\n### My Videos\n\nMore Videos\n\n0 seconds of 11 minutes, 50 secondsVolume 0%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nNext Up\n\n4 Square Feet Folding Workbench\n\n12:57\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n11:50\n\n07:05\n\nIt's made of inexpensive 1x3s and is screwed together with a drill. It's super\neasy to hang too! Our free plans and video walk you through the process, so\neven a novice DIYer can tackle this project!\n\nWe have a good sized pantry with deep shelves, but the can food situation\nnever was quite right. We have ample shelving space - it was more keeping the\ncans organized AND visible, but not having to go rearrange cans every couple\nof days. Who wants to do that?\n\nOn my last trip home from Costco, when I realized I had THREE cases of diced\ntomatoes already in the pantry, I had my moment. The canned food situation had\nto change.\n\nAt first, I thought of ways to create canned food systems on the shelf. We had\nbeen gifted a wire rack for the shelf, but the problem was keeping only one\nkind of can in each row - if one person went rouge on you, it's was all over.\n\nAnd then it hit me. The canned food needed to be in a dispenser on the big\nblank wall at the end of my pantry.\n\nHow did I not see that sooner.\n\nAnyway, after a couple of days of thinking about it, I built this!\n\nIt's pretty simple - all 1x3 boards, just screwed together with acrylic glass\non top. The trick was cutting the bottom at an angle, so the cans stay inside\nthe divider. And the acrylic glass on the front so I can see exactly how many\ncans of diced tomatoes I have all the time. I was lazy, so I designed the\nentire organizer to fit so I wouldn't have to cut the acrylic glass.\n\n## Features\n\n  * Low profile design takes up minimal space on the wall\n  * Automatically rotates older cans to the front\n  * Cans dispense easily, but won't fall out on their own\n  * Simple build using all off the shelf materials and basic tools\n  * Clear glass front keeps cans in plain sight so you know when you are running low\n  * Easy to hang with built in hanging supports on the back\n  * Can be easily modified to fit different height cans\n\n## No Acrylic Glass? No Problem!\n\nYou can use 1x2s and 1x3s instead of the acrylic glass, if that's your\npreference. It'll be cheaper and easier to build this way too. Just screw the\n1x2s and 1x3s to the front of the dividers.\n\n## Plans Sized Down from Photos\n\nI do need to tell you that the canned food organizer that I built was a full\n12 cans high - which is super awesome - but dropping the first can in 12 cans\nhigh is a little sketchy - will the can blow up? Will it shatter out the front\nacrylic glass? It hasn't yet on me, maybe it never will, but just to be safe,\nfor these plans, I adjusted so its only 8 cans high.\n\nIf you need more can storage, my recommendation is simply to build two (or\nmore) organizers, and stack them up.\n\n## Video Tutorial\n\nWe filmed the build process for this project, so please watch before you build\nfor lots of tips and tricks.\n\n## Can Organizer Plans\n\nThe free plans for this can organizer follow. We hope your project turns out\namazing and can't wait to see photos.

I painted everything white\nwith Behr Marquee satin in off the shelf white.\n\nProject Type\n\nKitchen Cabinet Plan, Accessories and Serving\n\nKitchen Organization and Accessories\n\nPantry Organization\n\nRoom\n\nPantry\n\nStorage Solutions\n\nComments\n\n## Comments\n\nsduerk\n\nTue, 10/29/2019 - 11:22\n\n### project dimensions\n\nGreat idea. Thanks Ana.\n\nI got stuck on a project yesterday that I don't understand. Your plan above\naddresses it. I built a bench with 3 cubbies under it for kids \"stuff\". I\ncould not figure out mathematically how to determine how wide every cubby\nshould be with my 3/4\" dividers. I thought I should take the width of the\nbench, subtract out the width of the dividers (2x3/4 = 1.5\") and divide by\nthree. However, I always ended up with one cubby being much larger than the\nother two. What was I doing wrong? Thanks in advance for your help and thank\nyou for your awesome website.\n\nScott\n\n  * Log in or register to post comments\n\nIn reply to project dimensions by sduerk\n\nAna White\n\nFri, 11/01/2019 - 14:48\n\n### Sometimes wood can be...\n\nSometimes wood can be thicker (or thinner) or other small issues that add up.\n\nWhat I often will do is place all the dividers in the shelf, all to one side.\nThen measure the opening that is left, and divide by the number of desired\nopenings.\n\n  * Log in or register to post comments\n\nDiNeums70\n\nSat, 07/11/2020 - 10:43\n\n### Perfect Ana!
