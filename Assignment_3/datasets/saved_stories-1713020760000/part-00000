Oceans\n\nadetokunbo.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nAccording to one recent estimate of how much plastics lie on the ocean floor,\neleven million tonnes of them make this sensitive part of the earth a resting\npoint, one hundred times more than plastics on ocean surfaces, with many more\nto come by 2050, when plastic production reaches around 590 million metric\ntonnes.\n\nBut the issue goes beyond plastics, because each year, the world witnesses an\naverage loss of about 1,382 containers to the ocean, with an astonishing 2,675\ncontainers vanishing beneath the waves from November 2020 to January 2021\nalone, 2021 seeing the sharpest rise in these incidents since 2013.\n\nAlso, thousands and thousands of cars stay on the ocean floor, with Felicity\nAce, a cargo ship carrying luxury cars accounting for nearly 4,000 of them\nwhen it sank in February 16, 2023, and a cargo ship called Blue Belt\nresponsible for some of the vehicles also, when it sank with at least 170\nToyotas on board in December 1977.\n\nOther materials than plastics, containers, and cars make up the wastes on the\nocean floor, with at least three million shipwrecks lying across the ocean\nfloor, more than 25 million pots and traps getting there yearly, while nearly\ntwo percent of all fishing gear experience the same thing.\n\nHumans produced more than 400 million metric tonnes of plastic per year by\n2021, but almost all went to waste generation, 354.3 million metric tonnes\ndisposed of by people, with plastic waste for recycling worldwide amounting to\njust 15 percent.\n\nShip groundings and structural failures affect container ships, and experts\nbelieve they cause more than 50 percent of container ship accidents on the\nsea, leading to approximately 12,000 shipping containers on the ocean floor.\n\nThe total number of ships lost in 2022 reached 38, a decline from 59 in the\nyear before for vessels over 100 gross tonnes, most of the losses happening in\nSouth China, Indonesia, the West African coast, and other areas.\n\nMaterials other than plastics reach the ocean floor the way containers, cars,\nand plastics do, leading to 25 million pots and traps on the seafloor each\nyear, 740,000 kilometers of fish line and 14 billion hooks on the sea, a\nnumber nearly two percent of fish gear used.\n\nBy 2050, plastics may outweigh all fish in the ocean, and since eight to 20\nmillion metric tonnes end up in the ocean each year, 81 percent of all marine\npollution arises from this, with plastics interfering with the sea\u2019s capacity\nto absorb and sequester carbon dioxide, thus accelerating climate change.\n\nHundreds of containers go missing at sea each year due to so many factors, and\nthough containers provide fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions per unit\nof cargo, they pose environmental harm at the bottom of the ocean through\ncontamination, since containers carry acid, alcohol, manufactured products,\nand other dangerous goods.\n\nDuring the second world wars, at least 20,000 ships sank into the ocean, but\nthe contents of the ships caused pollution, as about 20 million tonnes of oil\nwere involved, exposing commercial fish to higher levels of toxic compounds,\naffecting the microbial community in profound ways.\n\nIn essence, plastics accelerate climate change by interfering with the ocean's\ncapacity to absorb and sequester carbon dioxide, while missing containers and\nvehicles impact negatively on the wildlife at sea, along with pots and traps,\nfishing gear, and other materials littering the ocean floor.\n\nThe improvement of the waste system should prevent plastic wastes from\nentering oceans, this combined with a reduction in plastic usage on a daily\nbasis, plus a commitment towards recycling plastic, especially as single-use\nplastics account for 80 percent of all marine pollution.\n\nSince 8,500 shipwrecks leak around six billion gallons of oil on the ocean\nfloor, actions to prevent leaking will suffice to safeguard humans and\nenvironmental health to prevent pollution, which intensifies climate change.\n\nImprovements to the waste system and actions to prevent leaks by ships will\nmitigate some of the pollution on the ocean floor, a place littered with\nplastics, cars, second-war ships, containers, shipwrecks of past eras, fishing\ngear, pots, and all manner of wastes.\n\nWhat are the other things you know that pollute oceans?\n\n##\n\nWhat to Eat\n\nVegan food from Indonesia, Credit, Livekindly\n\nLeave a comment\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Beyond Plastics, Beyond Fishing Gear, Beyond Dead
