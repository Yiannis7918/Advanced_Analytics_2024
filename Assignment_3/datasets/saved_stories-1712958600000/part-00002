For those who have never heard the term, \"product management\" is\ndeciding what features to add to the product and in what order.\n\nIn those first few weeks I was faced with a huge blank page and it was very\noverwhelming to decide which features to build first. So, I spilt a lot of ink\ndescribing various heuristics to use for making product decisions in the early\nstages of a software product.\n\nIt's three months into eno's development and I have stronger convictions about\nhow to prioritize feature development. As I started to actually build the\nproduct, it became clear that certain features I envisioned were foundational\nto the technical architecture of eno and others were not. I use the word\n\"foundational\" as in a building's \"foundation\" because eno's code will all be\nbuilt on top of these foundational features. This isn't the result of my own\ndecisions but inherent to how these features work. They may or may not end up\nbeing the most loved features in eno but I kind of have to build them first.\n\nTo be concrete (pun intended), there are four features that form this\nfoundation:\n\n  1. Multi-document editing environment\n  2. Live templating\n  3. Integrated version control\n  4. Collaborative editing\n\nAs I have worked on these, I have learnt that they are inextricably linked\nwith one another. They must be built as a single cohesive unit rather than in\nsequence. Specifically, each of these features is tightly coupled to the\nunderlying data model of eno.\n\nAt this stage, I've laid out the scaffodling for a data model that can power\nall of these and I see a fairly clear path to building each feature out to a\nfeature complete state.\n\n### Finding a first user\n\nNow that I know what I am building, it's probably a good time to figure out\nwho would want to use it. That sounds like backwards logic and it probably is.\nI think it's defensible though. I have a long term vision for an eno that is\nso great that anyone working with documents will want to use it. That's at\nleast a few years off so I need to find some checkpoints along the way. I need\nto find a first user who might be interested in using eno long before it is\nfeature complete.\n\nThere are some clear requirements for this first user. First, they must have\nthe potential to get an extremely high amount of value out of eno. Anything\nless than that and they would be insane to risk working with a brand new,\nunproven product. From this I can extrapolate a two requirements:\n\n  1. They spend a lot of time every day working on documents. A tool to to help them do this would have a huge impact on their day-to-day.\n\n  2. A lot of their work has a highly formulaic pattern that eno could do much faster and better with its live templating and mutli-document editing features.\n\nIf convincing a person to use new risky software was hard, convincing that\nperson's coworkers to use it as well is even harder. For that reason I have a\nthird requirement:\n\n  3. Most of their work is done alone.\n\nFinally, there is a business reality. If a single person with a highly\nesoteric profession came out of the woodwork and satisfied this list to a T,\nit might be a bad decision to build an entire business around them. We need to\nensure that we can build a modest revenue stream from this initial group.\nThus, our last requirement:\n\n  4. There are either (1) a lot of this type of user willing to pay a small amount of money or (2) a few of this type of user willing to pay a lot of money.\n\n## Throwing in the towel on terminal UI\n\nIn my announcement for eno I stated the following:\n\n    \n    \n    To begin, [eno] will be a terminal UI application. For non-nerds, this means it will look like something out of the Matrix. I don't think anyone will want to use that version but it's a lot faster to prototype in. I can make it pretty later.\n\nI've decided the time to make it pretty is now. As I start to think more\nrealistically about getting actual non-technical professional's to use the\nproduct, I realize the terminal UI will hamstring me every step of the way.\neno needs to look awesome. If nothing else, it inspires confidence. Ideally,\nit brings joy to the people who use it.\n\nThough I expected to do this eventually, I thought it would be later than now.\nI was hoping to build out a fairly feature complete prototype in the terminal\nbefore investing in a full graphical user interface (GUI). As it turns out\nthough, building a terminal UI isn't exactly trivial and I am starting to feel\nthe burn of investing development cycles in something that I will ultimately\nthrow away.\n\nThe downside is there will be an immediate slow down as I spend time figuring\nout how to build a native GUI application. This means learning how graphics\nrendering works for the first time and figuring out font rendering - a\nnotoriously frustrating area of computer programming.\n\nThe other side effect I fear is that a non-terminal UI removes many\nconstraints on my design. With my work so far, there where many times where my\nmind ran away with ideas of how eno could look and feel. These tangents were\nquickly cut short because they were simply not possible to create in a\nterminal environment. A terminal is a giant grid of squares and each square\ncan only be one colour and have one letter in it. By moving to GUI I might be\nopening Pandora's box by allowing myself to consider basically any look and\nfeel I can dream up.\n\nSubscribe below to get notifications for new posts.\n\nWe also have and RSS feed\n\nPowered by Bear \u0295\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294\n\n", "frontpage": false}
