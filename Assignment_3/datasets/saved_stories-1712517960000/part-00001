You can try it online here! A simple example proof in\npropositional logic is shown below.\n\n## Documentation\n\nWarning\n\nWe are just beginning to write documentation, but you can find a tutorial\nonline here. New bug fixes, new features, and new documentation arrive almost\nevery day. Expect a more stable release in late spring of 2024.\n\nPotential new contributors can check out the new app's GitHub repository here.\n\n## Other tools\n\n  * The Lurch Deductive Engine (LDE) is the set of data structures and algorithms used under the hood to validate proofs\n  * We may later incorporate this JavaScript implementation of the Earley parsing algorithm to allow users to customize the notation used in the app, but that remains uncertain.\n  * Old versions of our work are archived here.\n\nDocumentation built with MkDocs.\n\n#### Search\n\nFrom here you can search these documents.
