High and\nrising college sticker prices are the subject of considerable attention.\n\nBut what matters to students and their families is not the sticker price but\nrather the amount they actually have to pay. Because of the availability of\nfinancial aid, most pay less than the sticker price. The average amount\nstudents actually pay (the \u201cnet price\u201d) has evolved quite differently over\ntime from the sticker price: it has recently stabilized and even fallen in the\nlast few years. But the average net price is only relevant for families with\naverage finances. What about everyone else?\n\nThis report shows how the actual price of college for families in different\neconomic circumstances has changed since the mid-1990s. I focus on dependent\nstudents attending four-year institutions living away from their parents\nbecause those are the students who face the highest sticker prices that\ntypically receive the most attention. They represent around 40% of the roughly\n9 million dependent college students and two-thirds of those enrolled full\ntime. These institutions often provide financial aid, using their own\nresources in addition to aid available from the federal and state governments.\nI separately examine public (for state residents) and private, nonprofit\ninstitutions because of the substantial differences in prices between them.\n\nSeveral conclusions emerge from this analysis:\n\n  * The sticker price is an increasingly poor indicator of college prices for all students, regardless of family income.\n  * The net price paid by students attending public institutions has risen for families at all income levels, but the increases have been larger for higher-income students.\n  * At private institutions, the net price is consistently higher than at public institutions, but for more than a decade it has only increased for higher-income students.\n  * Adjusted for inflation, net prices paid by students today at public institutions across the income distribution are similar to the prices they would have paid at private institutions in the mid-1990s.\n\n## How are actual college prices determined?\n\nThe full \u201ccost of attendance\u201d is defined by law to include tuition and fees,\nfood and housing, and all other educational and living expenses (books,\ntravel, and other personal expenses). Colleges and universities are required\nto publicly report that amount. It is often colloquially labeled the sticker\nprice. But financial aid drives a wedge between the COA and what students\nreally pay. The amount students actually pay is labeled the \u201cnet price,\u201d and\nit equals COA less any form of \u201cgrant-based\u201d financial aid (i.e., not a loan\nor subsidized work).\n\nThat aid can come in two forms: need-based and merit-based. Eligibility for\nneed-based aid is determined based on the financial information students\nprovide when they complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid\n(FAFSA).^1 That information is used to calculate the \u201cExpected Family\nContribution\u201d (EFC).^2 A student\u2019s \u201cfinancial need\u201d is the difference between\nthe COA and the EFC (need = COA \u2013 EFC). Students receiving federal financial\naid cannot receive aid in excess of financial need. Institutions are not\nrequired to provide the full amount of aid that students are eligible for, and\nmost do not. Those that do are said to \u201cmeet full need.\u201d\n\nMany institutions also award financial aid that lowers the net price for other\nreasons. It is typically labeled as merit aid because students with stronger\nacademic records receive larger awards. For students with no financial need,\nmerit aid directly reduces what students pay.\n\nFor students with financial need, though, merit-based aid often substitutes,\nat least partially, for need-based aid. That is, the need-based award is\nreduced when a student receives merit aid. This means that merit aid mostly\nbenefits higher-income students who otherwise would pay the full sticker\nprice.\n\nAt many institutions, this form of aid is awarded to a large fraction, and in\nsome cases even all, of its students. Such universal merit aid has the same\nimpact as reducing the sticker price. Colleges choose to offer it for\nmarketing purposes, setting a high sticker price to signal institutional\nquality while awarding \u201cmerit aid\u201d to signal support for admitted students.^3\n\n## The sticker price is the wrong way to track college costs\n\nMost students do not pay the full sticker price. In 2019-2020, 26% of in-state\npublic college students and 16% of students enrolled in private, nonprofit\ninstitutions paid the sticker price.^4 Those percentages have dropped from 53%\nand 29%, respectively, since 1995-1996. More students receive financial aid\nnow, highlighting the importance of relying on net price rather than the\nsticker price when tracking college costs over time.\n\nThe sticker price is even becoming an increasingly poor indicator of college\ncosts for higher-income students who are not eligible for need-based financial\naid. The growing use of merit-based aid at both public and private\ninstitutions accounts for this. At public institutions, the vast majority\n(79%) of those higher-income students paid the full sticker price in\n1995-1996. That share dropped to 47% in 2019-2020. At private institutions,\nthe decline was even greater, falling from 64% to 28% over that period.\n\nThe bottom line is that few students now pay the full sticker price,\nincluding, perhaps unexpectedly, those from higher-income families. Sticker\nprice is therefore becoming increasingly disconnected from the amount that\nstudents actually pay. The practice of tracking it should be exercised with\nextreme caution.\n\n## A better way to track college costs\n\nIf students do not pay the sticker price, how much do they pay? And,\ncritically, how does that amount change as family finances change? To answer\nthis question, I examine the relationship between a family\u2019s financial\nsituation, captured by their EFC, and how much they pay to attend college.\nThis relationship between EFC and net price is a fundamental element of the\nprocess colleges use to determine financial aid awards. Other factors matter,\nbut the EFC is critical in determining the amount that students pay. All else\nequal, the net price rises with EFC. At some point, though, the net price hits\na ceiling. That maximum net price is often lower than the sticker price\nbecause of the extensive use of merit awards, as I described earlier.\n\nTo better understand how net prices have changed over time for families with\ndifferent financial circumstances, I use available data to mimic the\nunderlying system that institutions use to determine students\u2019 net price.^5\nSeparately for each year of data, I estimate the linear relationship between\nnet prices and EFC among students who are eligible for need-based financial\naid. I also impose a \u201cmaximum net price,\u201d defined as the average amount paid\nby students who are not eligible for need-based aid. It is not precisely a\nmaximum because some students will pay more, but it represents the typical\namount paid by higher-income students whose net price is unrelated to\nfinancial need.\n\nThroughout this analysis, I distinguish state residents attending 4-year\npublic institutions from those attending 4-year private, nonprofit\ninstitutions (referred to simply as 4-year public and private institutions\ngoing forward). Data for this exercise are available every four years from\n1995-1996 through 2019-2020 from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study\n(NPSAS).^6 All dollar values are inflation adjusted and represent the price\nlevel in 2023.\n\nTo facilitate interpretation, all reported results are distinguished by family\nincome. I converted levels of the EFC to approximate levels of family income,\nassuming that families\u2019 asset holdings are typical of that income level.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, a literal interpretation of the results of this\nexercise is inappropriate. The exact amount that any particular student pays\nwill depend on their specific characteristics and those of the institutions\nthey attend. Among students with similar family incomes, other details of\ntheir financial situation will affect their net price. Even among students\nwith similar financial circumstances, the net price they pay can vary\nconsiderably across institutions and within institutions. But the results\npresented still provide a useful characterization of the system of college\npricing facing students over time.\n\nFigures 1A and 1B show the key findings. Figure 1A provides the results for\nstudents at public institutions. In the 1995-1996 academic year (all years on\nthe graph are labeled by the end of the academic year), students with family\nincomes under $50,000 typically faced a net price of about $12,500. The\ntypical net price increases with income. Every additional dollar of income\ntranslates to around a 16-cent increase in net price. Families with family\nincomes of roughly $75,000 typically faced a net price of around $16,000. Once\nincome reaches the vicinity of $100,000, the net price hits the maximum of\naround $19,000.\n\nIn each subsequent year, that relationship has shifted up.^7 By 2019-2020,\nstudents from families with incomes below $50,000 faced a typical net price of\n$18,000. A family with an income of around $125,000 paid the maximum net price\nof $29,000. The maximum net price increased between 1995-1996 and 2019-2020,\nso higher-income families became eligible for need-based financial aid.\n\nThis upward drift in net prices at public 4-year institutions indicates that\nthey are becoming increasingly more expensive over time for students at all\nlevels of the income distribution. The increase for higher-income families was\nlarger in dollar terms but roughly similar in percentage terms.\n\nFigure 1B shows the same relationships for 4-year private institutions. Prices\nat private institutions were higher than at public institutions for students\nat all income levels each year. Net prices also increased with incomes at a\nslightly higher rate (18 cents per dollar of income).\n\nPricing patterns over time, though, observed at these institutions are not\nquite the same as those at public institutions. The fundamental difference is\nthat net prices for lower- and middle-income students stopped rising in\n2007-2008. The prices those students pay have remained roughly constant in\nreal terms since then.\n\nOne should not interpret this finding as indicating private colleges are\nbecoming more affordable for low- and middle-income students. Students with\nincomes under $50,000 are still being asked to pay around $25,000 to attend a\ntypical private institution. But that amount is no longer rising faster than\nthe rate of inflation.\n\nNet prices charged to higher-income students at these institutions have risen\nconsistently over time. In 1995-1996, the maximum net price at private\ninstitutions was $37,000. Students hit that threshold at a family income of\naround $150,000. By 2019-2020, the maximum net price jumped to $53,000 and it\ncorresponded to income of around $200,000.\n\nNet prices paid by students enrolled in the small set of private, highly-\nendowed private colleges and universities that meet full need are unlikely to\nfollow these patterns. Students pay their EFC at these institutions, perhaps\nalong with loan and work expectations. As I have shown elsewhere, their net\nprices are lower than at other private institutions for all but higher-income\nstudents. They are even lower than at public institutions for lower-income\nstudents. For students with the same EFC at different points in time, there is\nno reason their net price would have changed much. But only a small number of\ninstitutions fall in this category, making it difficult to analyze them\nseparately.^8\n\nNote that the scales on the graphs for public and private institutions are\ndifferent to best illustrate the pricing patterns at each type of institution.\nFigure 2 is designed to overcome that problem, including data for both sets of\ninstitutions for a subset of years on the same scale. It shows that private\ninstitutions are clearly more expensive than public institutions, as one might\nexpect. We also see that public institutions in 2019-2020 charge prices that\nare not unlike those charged at private institutions almost 25 years earlier,\nparticularly for lower- and middle-income families and after factoring in\nfinancial aid.\n\nAn important contribution of this analysis is tracking the net price that\nlower-income students pay over time. I am not aware of any other source that\nprovides this information. Figure 3 focuses specifically on that group,\npresenting typical net prices paid by students from families with incomes\nbelow $50,000 over time in the two different types of institutions.\n\nThese statistics identify an obvious affordability problem for this group. At\npublic institutions the net price that these students pay has risen from\n$12,500 to $18,000 between 1995-1996 and 2019-2020. The lower amount would\nhave been difficult for these families to pay then, but these institutions\nhave become even less affordable over time. The cost of a private institution\nfor these students may have stopped rising, but it started and ended the\nperiod at a higher level (roughly $20,000 to $25,000, respectively).\n\nAlthough net prices have risen for students across the income distribution at\nboth public and private institutions, these increases are considerably smaller\nthan increases in sticker prices.^9 Sticker prices have risen roughly 70% at\nboth types of institutions between 1995-1996 and 2019-2020 ($20,500 to $35,000\nat public institutions and $42,000 to $72,000 at private institutions). For\nlower-income students (defined here as those with incomes below $50,000), net\nprices have increased by 44% and 24% at public and private institutions,\nrespectively. Those increases are still substantial, but they are considerably\nsmaller than the increase in the sticker price.\n\n## Where do we go from here?\n\nThis analysis yields several implications for policy discussions regarding\ncollege pricing. First, the nearly universal focus on the sticker price in\npublic discourse is detrimental to our understanding of college costs. It is\nthe easiest measure to track, but it is a misleading statistic that a small\nand declining number of students pay. Even many higher-income families do not\npay the full sticker price.\n\nSecond, we need much better information about how much students in different\nfinancial circumstances would have to pay for college and how those prices\nhave changed over time. Understanding how much lower- and middle-income\nstudents pay is particularly important if we are seeking to improve college\naccess. That information is limited now. One recent survey found that only 19%\nof Americans know that lower-income students pay less for college than higher-\nincome students.\n\nThird, college costs are still too high, and increasingly so over time.\nCollege is indeed expensive for higher-income students, but the affordability\nproblem is much greater\u2014and more consequential\u2014for lower- and middle-income\nstudents. If they can\u2019t afford it, they can\u2019t go.\n\nOur current system of setting and communicating college prices simply does not\nwork. We cannot expect students to make sound decisions regarding educational\ninvestments if they do not understand how much college will actually cost\nthem. Public officials make strategic decisions affecting the higher education\nsystem facing similar blind spots. The media routinely reports on college\npricing based on inadequate information. And, ultimately, college costs are\ntoo high, particularly for lower- and middle-income students. We cannot expect\nimprovements in the market for higher education if we do not know the facts.\nThis report is a step in that direction.\n\n## Technical Appendix: Data and Methodology\n\nAll the analyses reported in this report are based on data from the 1995-1996\nthrough 2019-2020 waves (available every fourth year) of the National\nPostsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). In each wave, I have restricted the\ndata to dependent students enrolled full-time at a single institution living\naway from their parents (on or off campus).^10 These seven waves of the NPSAS\nwere conducted during a period when the formula for determining a student\u2019s\nEFC was largely unchanged. All NPSAS data used in this report is restricted\nand accessed under a licensing agreement with the Institute for Education\nScience/National Center for Education Statistics (IES/NCES).\n\nThere are 86,000 students included in these seven waves of NPSAS data that\nsatisfy the sample restrictions. In 2019-2020, over 3 million students satisfy\nthese conditions. I have replicated all the analyses included in this report\nfurther restricting the sample to those living on campus (around 2 million\nstudents in 2019-2020) and obtained similar results.\n\nStudents are divided into two categories, based on whether they have\n\u201cfinancial need\u201d depending on whether their expected family contribution (EFC)\nis greater than the cost of attendance (COA) at the institution they attend\n(COA \u2013 EFC > 0). For those who have no financial need, I calculate the average\nnet price separately for students attending 4-year public institutions and\nthose attending 4-year private institutions. These statistics are generated\nseparately using data from each NPSAS wave. The results set the upper bound of\nnet prices in each wave in each type of institution in this analysis.\n\nFor students with financial need (EFC < COA), I estimate linear quantile\nregression models at the 50th percentile (i.e., the median) relating the net\nprice paid to their EFC. I extended this approach in a preliminary analysis,\nallowing the year/institution type slope to be non-linear (quadratic). The\nresults indicated some non-nonlinearity exists (increasing at a decreasing\nrate), but it is minor and I chose to maintain the simplicity of restricting\nthe slope to be linear.\n\nIn the analysis reported in Figures 1A and 1B, a single regression is\nestimated for each type of institution across all NPSAS waves, restricting the\nslope coefficient relating net price to EFC to be constant, but the intercept\nis allowed to change by wave. I tested the sensitivity of this restriction\nrelative to models that estimate this relationship separately by type of\ninstitution and academic year. This approach allows for the linear slope to\ndiffer in different years. Although there is some variability in slopes of the\nnet price/EFC profile by academic year, they are not dramatic. I therefore\nimpose the constant slope restriction for ease of interpretation, without much\nloss of detail.\n\nThe results from the regression analysis that imposes a constant slope over\ntime generate the sloped portions of the relationship between approximate\nfamily income (EFC) and the net price, as displayed in Figures 1A and 1B. The\nsloped portion is allowed to increase until it intersects with the average net\nprice paid by students with no financial need in each sector and NPSAS\nwave.^11\n\nSeparately, I also estimate a linear regression relating family income,\nmeasured as the adjusted gross income (AGI) that parents report on their\nchild\u2019s FAFSA form, and the resulting FAFSA EFC. This analysis is also\nrestricted to those students who have financial need. I use the results from\nthis analysis to predict family income for alternative values of EFC. It is\nthose predictions of family income based on EFC that are provided in Figures\n1A, 1B, and 2.\n\nAuthors\n\nPhillip Levine Nonresident Senior Fellow - Economic Studies, Center for\nEconomic Security and Opportunity @phil_wellesley\n\nRelated Content\n\nExperts discuss whether college is still worth it\n\nHigher Education Experts discuss whether college is still worth it\n\nGabriela Goodman\n\nDecember 13, 2023\n\nHow much should college cost students?\n\nHigher Education How much should college cost students?\n\nPhillip Levine\n\nSeptember 6, 2023\n\nImproving college access through financial aid transparency and FAFSA\nsimplification\n\nEducation Improving college access through financial aid transparency and\nFAFSA simplification\n\nElizabeth Gellman, Katharine Meyer\n\nMay 4, 2023\n\n  * Acknowledgements and disclosures\n\nThe Brookings Institution is financed through the support of a diverse array\nof foundations, corporations, governments, individuals, as well as an\nendowment.

They do not do so because they face a \u201cprisoners\u2019 dilemma.\u201d If any one school changed their policy on its own, it would lose students. If all agreed to so simultaneously, that would overcome the problem, but it also likely would be seen as a violation of anti-trust laws.\n    4. I use data from the 1995-1996 through 2019-2020 waves (available every fourth year) of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) to calculate these statistics and in all other analysis in this report. The technical appendix provides greater details regarding the data and methods used.\n    5. A more traditional approach for providing this information would be to establish categories of EFC or income and compute mean or median net prices within those categories. I conducted such an analysis, but opted for the regression-based approach instead. That approach has the advantage of providing results that are less dependent on having sufficient data within relatively narrow EFC bands. It also provides a better method of determining a typical EFC level at which point net prices stop rising. All the analysis is conducted with the same NPSAS data referenced earlier.\n    6. Note that the 2019-2020 NPSAS was just released in the fall of 2023. A new wave will not be available for a few more years.\n    7. The slopes in these lines are forced to be the same over time, but a more flexible specification allowing them to change indicates that those changes are minimal. More detail is provided in the appendix.\n    8. At these institutions, a student\u2019s financial need is likely to be determined by information provided on the CSS Profile, not FAFSA, which includes more financial detail and places a heavier emphasis on assets. This information is not available in the NPSAS, further hindering an analysis of their pricing systems.\n    9. This finding is consistent with the analysis conducted by Cooke and Turner (2022).\n    10. The results of this analysis are similar, albeit noisier, when I repeat the exercise separately for those who live on or off campus. A similar pattern is observed for students who live with their parents, albeit at lower levels. Lower-income students who live with their parents are generally able to cover the stated tuition (ignoring other cost factors incorporated into the full cost of attendance) throughout this time period at public institutions.\n    11.
