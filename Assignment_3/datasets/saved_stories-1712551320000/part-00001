Following a number of viral social\nmedia posts showcasing the latency of its rack-scale AI inference systems, the\ncompany currently has 70,000 developers registered for its real-time large\nlanguage model (LLM) inference cloud service, GroqCloud, with 19,000 new\napplications running.\n\n\u201cYou get the sort of developer traction we\u2019ve gotten, and people want to buy\nhardware, but we are no longer selling hardware, because why would we at this\npoint?\u201d Ross said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a pivot\u2014we always intended to have a cloud\nservice, we just expected we would do both.\u201d\n\nPartner Content\n\nView All\n\nNuvoton drives the EV market with its cutting-edge battery monitoring chipset\nsolution\n\nBy Nuvoton Technology Corporation Japan 04.03.2024\n\nImproved Power Efficiency and AI Inference in Autonomous Systems\n\nBy Shingo Kojima, Sr Principal Engineer of Embedded Processing, Renesas\nElectronics 03.26.2024\n\nLeveraging Advanced Microcontroller Features to Improve Industrial Fan\nPerformance\n\nBy Dylan Liu, Geehy Semiconductor 03.21.2024\n\nIf customers come with requests for high volumes of chips for very large\ninstallations, Groq will instead propose partnering on data center deployment.\nRoss said that Groq has \u201csigned a deal\u201d with Saudi state-owned oil company\nAramco, though he declined to give further details, saying only that the deal\ninvolved \u201ca very large deployment of [Groq] LPUs.\u201d This strategy from a\nstartup is not entirely unprecedented. AI chip startup Cerebras already\npartners with G42 to sell excess capacity on G42\u2019s Cerebras-based AI\nsupercomputers\u2014though it is unusual.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government and its allies are the only ones we\u2019d be willing to sell\nhardware to,\u201d Ross said. (Groq\u2019s chips are fabricated and packaged in North\nAmerica.) \u201cFor anyone else, we\u2019re setting up commercial clouds [together], but\nthat\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nRoss is optimistic about Groq\u2019s ability to scale out to meet demand, in part\nbecause Groq\u2019s chip does not use high-bandwidth memory (HBM). Two of the three\nHBM makers, SK Hynix and Micron, have said they have sold out their entire\n2024 capacity, with Micron even saying recently that 2025\u2019s capacity is almost\ngone. Competing solutions, including Nvidia GPUs, rely on HBM.\n\n\u201cGroq is in a very unusual position because we\u2019re the only ones who not only\ndon\u2019t use HBM, but also have a practical solution where the software works,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThat means we can achieve a level of scale that no-one else can.\u201d\n\nA cluster of Groq Racks. (Source: Groq)\n\nIn terms of scale, Ross said Groq plans to deploy 42,000 language processing\nunit (LPU) chips itself this year as part of GroqCloud, with Aramco and other\npartners \u201cin the process of finalizing\u201d their deals for approaching the same\nnumber of chips.\n\n\u201cWe have the capacity to [make] 220,000 LPUs this year, and we are looking for\npartners to work with us on that,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWe have the ability to do 1.5\nmillion by next year [including the 220,000 this year], but only about a\nmillion is unallocated at this point, and that is getting rapidly eaten up now\nthat people know we\u2019re doing big deals.\u201d\n\nGroq acquired Palo Alto startup Definitive Intelligence last month; the\ncompany is an AI-powered business insights firm. Definitive Intelligence CEO\nSunny Madra now leads GroqCloud, and the team will focus on expanding\ncapacity, improving efficiency, forming partnerships, and building out the\ndeveloper platform.\n\nBy becoming a cloud services provider who also makes its own chips, is Groq\neffectively trying to mimic the hyperscaler model?\n\n\u201cThere might need to be a new term, because by the end of next year we\u2019re\ngoing to deploy enough LPUs that compute-wise, it\u2019s going to be the equivalent\nof all the hyperscalers combined,\u201d he said. \u201cWe already have a non-trivial\nportion of that.\u201d\n\nIn terms of performance, GroqCloud is benchmarked by artificialanalysis.ai at\n467 tokens per second for Mixtral 8x7B, while other GPU-based services did not\nget above 200. Demos for 7B models seen by EE Times went as high as 750 tokens\nper second. Groq is working on further speedups by implementing features like\nspeculative decoding, where smaller models are used combined with a bigger\nmodel to check their output and temperature\u2014a parameter which controls whether\nthe most likely tokens are picked and influences the so-called \u2018creativity\u2019 of\nthe model.\n\nGroq\u2019s first-gen chip, the LPU. (Source: Groq)\n\nGroq, whose first-gen silicon is almost five years old at this point, is also\nworking on its next-gen LPU.\n\n\u201cWe are taping out this year,\u201d Ross said, noting that Groq gen two will skip\nseveral process nodes from 14 nm to 4 nm, so customers should expect a big\nboost in performance.\n\nWhile the new silicon will be optimized for generative AI via Groq\u2019s in-house\ndesign-space exploration tool, it will not have specific features for LLMs,\nRoss said. Groq has run other types of AI on its LPUs from the start,\nincluding CNNs and LSTMs, plus generative AI in multiple modalities.\n\nIn the mean time, Groq seems to be confident enough with its five-year\u2013old\nsilicon. Following Nvidia\u2019s announcement of the next-gen Blackwell GPU\narchitecture, which promises 30\u00d7 training performance for generative AI, Groq\nput out a press release with a simple two-word response: \u201cStill faster.\u201d\n\nRELATED TOPICS: AI AND BIG DATA\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n\nSally Ward-Foxton\n\nSally Ward-Foxton covers AI for EETimes.com and EETimes Europe magazine.
