This allows the model\nto automatically access documents or perform more complex calculations.\nAccording to Anthropic, Claude 3 can reliably select the right tool for a task\nfrom hundreds of options.\n\nCustomers can give Claude access to internal knowledge databases, real-time\ndata, and complex calculations via structured APIs. In addition, Claude can\norchestrate sub-agents to handle granular requests. This allows the AI model\nto be augmented with custom functionality to handle a wider range of tasks.\n\nTools must be provided by API users, as Claude itself does not have any built-\nin tool functionality. Each tool consists of a name, a detailed description,\nand an input schema in JSON format.\n\nAnthropic recommends providing as much detail and context about the tools in\nthe descriptions as possible, so that Claude can learn how to use them\ncorrectly. The description is even more important than the usage examples.\nEach tool should be described with at least three to four sentences that\nanswer questions like\n\nAd\n\nTHE DECODER Newsletter\n\nThe most important AI news straight to your inbox.\n\n\u2713 Weekly\n\n\u2713 Free\n\n\u2713 Cancel at any time\n\n  * What the tool does\n  * When to use it (and when not to)\n  * What each parameter means and how it affects the behavior of the tool\n  * Important caveats or limitations, such as what information the tool will not return if the tool name is unclear\n\nIf Claude recognizes a suitable tool, the API returns a response with the\nreason \"tool_use\".

This allows Claude to access documents, perform complex calculations and orchestrate sub-agents to handle a wider range of tasks.\n  * To select the right tools, Claude needs detailed descriptions of the tools in JSON format. These should explain what the tool does, when it should be used and what the individual parameters mean. According to Anthropic, Claude 3 can reliably select the right tool for a task from hundreds of tools.\n  * Using \"chain of thought\" prompting, Claude shows step by step how it combines tools for a task. The top model, Opus, is best at using multiple complex tools and dealing with missing parameters.\n\nSources\n\nAnthropic\n\nMatthias Bastian\n\nOnline journalist Matthias is the co-founder and publisher of THE DECODER.
