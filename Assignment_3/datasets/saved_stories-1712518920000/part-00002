That\u2019s how many jobs have been cut this year, according to the\nChallenger report. Despite March having more single-month job loss than any\nother month since January of 2023, cuts are actually down overall from last\nyear. By this time in 2023, 270,416 jobs had been lost.\n\n## Surprising Fact\n\nMore jobs have been cut in the eastern region of the country (which\nencompasses 12 states including New York, Massachusetts and Washington D.C.)\nthan any other. More than 94,000 cuts have been made in the region so far this\nyear, followed by 92,178 in the West, 37,639 in the Midwest and 33,031 in the\nSouth, according to the Challenger report.\n\n## Crucial Quote\n\n\u201cMany companies appear to be reverting to a \u2018do more with less\u2019 approach,\u201d\nAndy Challenger, the firm\u2019s senior vice president, said in a statement. \u201cWhile\ntechnology continues to lead all industries so far this year, several\nindustries, including energy and industrial manufacturing, are cutting more\njobs this year than last.\u201d\n\n## Contra\n\nDespite the layoffs and slow hiring, American unemployment has been below 4%\nfor 25 consecutive months, the longest such streak since the 1960s, according\nto the Associated Press. Unemployment was 3.7% in December and January, but\nrose to 3.9%, a two-year high, in February. When the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics releases its monthly jobs report on Friday, economists expect the\nrate to dip slightly.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nMORE FROM FORBESGold Hits Another High-Despite A Strong Stock Market And\nEconomy.
