It is also like REST - everyone is saying that they are doing\nit, but no one has implemented it by-the-book (the REST police might send me\nto jail for saying this). All of that is fine, but if you are doing it, don\u2019t\nend up by just using the bad parts of it - embrace the goodies too!\n\nSo what are the bad parts of Scrum?\n\nThanks for reading Nikola\u2019s Substack!

The cure for\nthese might be obvious - you don\u2019t need to do them every time!\n\nConsider demo only once per month?\n\nNo dailies on Fridays - a meeting-free Friday is a great practice!\n\nRetrospective - after each sprint, do a small poll and see if people want it\nor not.\n\nThe grooming/refinement - use half of the booked time to vote on and discuss\ntickets opened by the team members, outside of business - these can be\ntechnical improvements or investigations.\n\nThe story-points and estimations are often debated and misused. What is a\npoint and how much time does one story point take?! Teams often struggle with\nthis, but it can be solved with simple, straightforward rules. For example,\nsay that 5 points is how much an average contributor can do in one sprint, and\nmake sure that people are reminded about it. Or, skip the points, and just use\nhours. Whatever you choose, make sure to respect it in velocity planning. No\nneed to obsess about it, just use it as a rough estimate on how much the team\nshould take in one sprint. Another approach is to try planning points/hours\nper person, and not per team - this is quite controversial per scrum rules,\nbut I think it works better in practice.\n\nMVP at the end of each sprint - I think this only works for early-stage, small\nproducts, and that it cannot work in more mature/bigger environments - so just\nignore it!\n\n####\n\nOK, enough of the annoying stuff, so what are the good things about Scrum?\n\nThe sprint - yeah it is stressful having to deliver every 2/3 weeks, but at\nleast - you shouldn\u2019t be interrupted by the new stuff before the next\nplanning. It is important to have a culture where sprint is uninterruptible,\nunless in urgent/special cases - like dropping a database in production.\n\nThe Scrum master role - it can become quite a bureaucratic job, but it can\nalso be very helpful for the team, if done well. The main role of this person\nis to push back on business when the team feels it is necessary. If the team\nis burnt-out or if there are a lot of stability issues, it is often a good\nidea to stop with new business requirements and focus one or more sprints on\nimprovements and fixes. This can be quite healing for both the team and the\nproduct. Another important point is to limit the meeting durations/agendas and\nproductively navigate through them.\n\nWhen no one wants to take this role - you can try a rotating scrum master,\nwhere every sprint another team member takes the role.\n\nThat\u2019s all folks, hope that it helps someone!\n\nThanks for reading Nikola\u2019s Substack!
