It opens the door\nto massive productivity gains, up to the point where human skills are\ncompletely replaced. One area of interest is stock photos, where users\ntypically pay a license fee to use copyright-protected photos or music. A new\nstartup aims to disrupt this field by putting high-quality AI photos and music\nin the public domain, for free.\n\nOver the past year-and-a-half, artificial intelligence has been enjoying its\nmainstream breakthrough.\n\nThe instant success of ChatGPT and other AI-based tools and services kick-\nstarted what many believe is a new revolution.\n\nBy now it is clear that AI offers endless possibilities. While there\u2019s no\nshortage of new avenues to pursue, most applications rely on input or work\nfrom users. That\u2019s fine for the tech-savvy, but some prefer instant results.\n\nFor example, we have experimented with various AI-powered image-generation\ntools to create stock images to complement our news articles. While these all\nwork to some degree, it can be quite a challenge to get a good output; not to\nmention that it costs time and money too.\n\n## StockCake\n\nBut what if someone created a stock photo website pre-populated with over a\nmillion high-quality royalty-free images? And what if we could freely use the\nphotos from that site because they\u2019re all in the public domain? That would be\ngreat.\n\nEnter: StockCake...\n\nStockCake is a new platform by AI startup Imaginary Machines. The site\ncurrently hosts more than a million pre-generated images. These images can be\ndownloaded, used, and shared for free. There are no strings attached as all\nphotos are in the public domain.\n\nAI-generated public domain photos\n\nA service like this isn\u2019t of much use to people who aim to generate completely\ncustom images or photos. All content is pre-made and there is no option to\nalter the prompts. Instead, the site is aimed at people who want instant stock\nimages for their websites, social media, or any other type of presentation.\n\n## Using AI to Democratize Media\n\nTorrentFreak spoke with StockCake founder Nen Fard to find out what motivated\nhim to start this project and how he plans to develop it going forward. He\ntold us that it\u2019s long been a dream to share media freely online with anyone\nwho needs it.\n\n\u201cMy journey towards leveraging AI for media content began with a keen interest\nin the field\u2019s rapid advancements. The defining moment came when I observed a\nsignificant leap in the quality of AI-generated content, reaching a standard\nthat was not just acceptable but impressive.\n\n\u201cThis realization was pivotal, sparking the transition from ideation to\naction. It underscored the feasibility of using AI to fulfill a long-held\ndream of democratizing media content, leading to the birth of StockCake,\u201d Fard\nadds.\n\nThe careful reader will pick up that Fard\u2019s responses were partly edited using\nAI technology. However, the message is clear, Fard saw the potential to create\na vast library of stock photos and added these to the public domain, free to\nthe public at large. And it didn\u2019t stop there.\n\n## StockTune\n\nShortly after releasing StockCake, Fard went live with another public domain\nproject; StockTune. This platform is pretty much identical but focuses on\naudio instead. The tracks that are listed can be used free of charge and\nwithout attribution.\n\nStockTune\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see how these two sites can replace the basic use of\ncommercial stock footage platforms. While they are still in their infancy, the\nsites already offer quite a decent quality selection. At the same time, there\nare also various AI filters in place to ensure that inappropriate content is\nminimized.\n\nThe AI technology, which is in part based on OpenAI and Stability AI, also\naims to ensure that the underlying models are legitimate. While there are\nalways legal issues that can pop up, both services strive to play fair, so\nthey can continue to grow, perhaps indefinitely.\n\n## Ever-Expanding Libraries\n\nAt the time of writing, StockCake has a little over a million photos hosted on\nthe site, while there are nearly 100,000 tracks on StockTune. This is just the\nbeginning, though, as AI generates new versions every minute, then adds them\nto the site if the quality is on par.\n\nTheoretically, there\u2019s no limit to the number of variations that can be\ncreated. While quality is leading, the founder\u2019s vision has always been to\ncreate unrestricted access to media. This means that the libraries are ever-\nexpanding.\n\n\u201cThe inception of StockCake and StockTune was driven by a vision to\nrevolutionize the accessibility of media content. Unlike traditional\nplatforms, we leverage the limitless potential of AI to create an ever-\nexpanding, diverse set of photos and songs,\u201d Fard says.\n\nBoth stock media sites have something suitable for most general topics.\nHowever, you won\u2019t find very specific combinations, such as a \u201csquirrel\nplaying football.\u201d AI-rendered versions of some people, Donald Trump, for\nexample, appear to be off limits too.\n\n## Monetizing the Public Domain?\n\nWhile the above all sounds very promising, the sites are likely to face plenty\nof challenges. The platforms are currently not monetized but the AI technology\nand hosting obviously cost money, so this will have to change.\n\nFard tells us that he plans to keep access to the photos and audio completely\nfree. However, he\u2019s considering options to generate revenue. Advertising would\nbe one option, but more advanced subscription-based services are too. Or to\nput it in his AI-amplified words;\n\n\u201cAs our platforms continue to grow and evolve, they will naturally give rise\nto opportunities that support our sustainability without compromising our\nvalues. We aim to foster a community where creativity is unrestrained by\nfinancial barriers, and every advancement brings us closer to this goal,\u201d Fard\nsays.\n\nAI-generated \u2018wealthy cat\u2019 (bonus audio)\n\nFor example, the developer plans to launch a suite of AI-powered tools for\nexpert users, to personalize and upscale images when needed. That could be\npart of a paid service. However, existing footage will remain in the public\ndomain, without charge, he promises.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, we plan to introduce a suite of AI-powered tools that promise\nto enhance the creative possibilities for our users significantly. These\ninclude upscaling tools for generating higher-resolution photos, style\ntransfer tools that can adapt content to specific artistic aesthetics, and\ncharacter/object replacement tools for personalized customization.\u201d\n\n## The C Word\n\nIt\u2019s remarkable that a small startup can create this vast amount of stock\nfootage and share it freely. This may also spook some of the incumbents, who\nmake millions of dollars from their stock photo platforms. While these can\u2019t\nstop AI technology, they can complain. And they do.\n\nFor example, last year, Getty Images sued Stability AI, alleging that it used\nits stock photos to train its models. This lawsuit remains ongoing. While Fard\ndoesn\u2019t anticipate any legal trouble, he has some thoughts on the copyright\nimplications.\n\n\u201cAt Imagination Machines, the driving force behind StockCake and StockTune, we\nbelieve that the essence of creativity and innovation should be accessible to\nall. This belief guides our approach to AI-generated media, which, by its\nnature, challenges traditional notions of copyright,\u201d Fard says.\n\nThe site\u2019s developer trusts that the company\u2019s AI partners respect existing\ncopyright law. And by putting all creations in the public domain, the company\nitself claims no copyrights.\n\n\u201cCurrently, AI-generated content resides in a unique position within copyright\nlaws. These laws were crafted in a different era, focusing on human authorship\nas the cornerstone of copyright eligibility. However, the remarkable\ncapabilities of AI to generate original, high-quality photos and music without\ndirect human authorship put us at the edge of a new frontier.\n\n\u201cWe operate under the current legal framework, which does not extend copyright\nprotection to works created without human ingenuity, allowing us to offer this\ncontent in the public domain.\u201d\n\nBoth StockCake and StockTune have the potential to be disruptors, but Fard\nwants to play fair and remain within the boundaries of the law. He also\nunderstands that the law may change in the future, and plans to have his voice\nheard in that debate.\n\n\u201cOur goal is not just to navigate the current legal issues but also to\nactively advocate for laws that recognize the potential of AI to democratize\naccess to creative content while respecting the rights and contributions of\nhuman creators,\u201d Fard concludes.\n\nWith AI legal battles and copyright policy revving up globally, there\u2019s\ncertainly plenty of opportunity to advocate.\n\n  * Previous Post\n\n### Tagged In:\n\n  * ai\n  * artificial intelligence\n\n### You Might Also Like:\n\n### Block Innovation By Supporting the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act\n\n  * yesterday, 17:33 by Andy Maxwell\n\n### \u2018The New York Times Needs More than \u2018Imagined Fears\u2019 to Block AI\nInnovation\u2019\n\n  * March 29, 2024, 23:52 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\n### Music Industry Threatens \u2018Deepfake AI Music\u2019 Service With Legal Action\n\n  * March 20, 2024, 17:10 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nSubmit a correction or tip.\n\n##### Sponsors\n\n##### Popular Posts\n\n  * #### Which VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously?\n\n  * #### Iconic Torrent Site RARBG Shuts Down, All Content Releases Stop\n\n  * #### \u2018U.S. Authorities Seize Z-Library Domain Names\u2019\n\n  * #### House of The Dragon Season Finale Leaks Early on Pirate Sites\n\n  * #### US Court Orders Every ISP in the United States to Block Illegal Streaming Sites\n\n##### From 2 Years ago...\n\nTorguard Settles Piracy Lawsuit and Agrees to Block Torrent Traffic on U.S.\nServers\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nTorguard Settles Piracy Lawsuit and Agrees to Block Torrent Traffic on U.S.\nServers\n\nDisney+ Launched and Pirates Love It, Especially Mandalorian\n\nWhy People Pirate Game of Thrones, a Global Cost Breakdown\n\n#### TorrentFreak Stats\n\n  * ### 14947\n\nBreaking news stories\n\n  * ### 179k\n\nSocial media followers\n\n  * ### 19.9k\n\nRSS subscribers\n\nCopyright \u00b7 Privacy Policy \u00b7 VPN Providers \u00b7 About TorrentFreak\n\n", "frontpage": true}
