America don\u2019t want to\nfight your deadly thieving playground battles while your leader and you treat\nus with incredible disrespect. You ain\u2019t distracting us anymore with stunts\nlike this. Time\u2019s up for your settler hyenas and criminal occupiers. You will\nhave enough to do preparing your war crimes trial defenses, fellahs.\n\n13\n\n### Aine Ahmed\n\n16:11\n\nThey sent their lowest grade payload...$20,000 drones.. America is not going\nto fight your fight even though there is a bonehead in the White House. You\ninstigate and then play victim. People are onto you now. Call Hollywood and\ntell it to cue the Holocaust movies.\n\nReply to comment\n\n#### PB\n\n16:16Aine Ahmed\n\n\u201cYou instigate and then play victim. People are onto you now.\u201d Exactly.\n\n12\n\n### Slow Drones, warnings in advance\n\n16:00\n\nNo intention on doing any civilian or commercial damage... However, all 7\nhyper-sonic missiles landed doing damage to an airbase. Israel is defenseless\nagainst them..\n\n11\n\n### JAFeldman\n\n15:57\n\nEnough is enough! To proceed further would be extremely unwise... At this\npoint in time both Israel and Iran have saved face... unless there are further\nIranian strikes this is a satisfactory end.\n\n10\n\n### John Cronin\n\n15:40\n\n' Analysis: Fending Off Iran Attack Is a Major Israeli Achievement.\nRetaliation Would Risk an All-out Regional War '\n\nFending off ALL attacks from now on might well be considered a major\nachievement for the whole world, a very distinctive feather in its cap, one\nthat has displayed so very few in times gone by and throughout virtually all\nof ages past.\n\nLaxiankey - Endgame, 2024.\n\n9\n\n### Smadar\n\n15:39\n\nLet's be honest we should not be surprised by this attack from Iran upon\nIsrael given all that's happened over the years. There's no military\ndeterrence and the escalation of this conflict could escalate to a point of\nmany regrets. Luckily there was little damage and no deaths from this attack\nfrom Iran thanks to U.S. and other nations support. But this conflict needs to\nbe resolved with a comprehensive diplomatic approach. There's no reason to\ncontinue a revengeful response because it will not achieve anything which a\ndiplomatic initiative can for the whole Middle East region. Palestinian\nPresident Abbas can start to proclaim that Iran needs to exclude itself from\nthe Israeli-Palestinian territorial conflict which should be resolved through\na negotiated agreement. Everything stems from this unresolved territorial\nconflict and the Israeli occupation of the Palestinians. Unless one recognizes\nthis issue we can expect more of the same and stupidity on Israel's part if\nnot restrained.\n\n8\n\n### Pa\n\n15:34\n\nYou underestimate the neocon influence on Biden. Those who advocate an attack\non Iran's nuclear installations have never had such a golden opportunity. Even\nif Iran retaliates with a 1000 missiles only Israel suffers. If you think\nBiden will stop this when he never took that option in Ukraine or Gaza then\ncite some action on his part to prove it. And as for Bibi, we'll you should\nknow what he did with the October war crimes of Hamas and now he has the\nopportunity to take out Iran. Do you think he will not take this opportunity\nand go quietly to prison?\n\n7\n\n### Dutch Pete\n\n15:33\n\nWith this Israel-provoked attack by Iran, Netanyahu wants the world to still\nperceive Israel as a victim rather than a perpetrator (of the genocide in\nGaza). It's scandalous, however, that the leaders of the Western countries\nthat have allowed themselves to be manipulated by Israel have turned a blind\neye for six months, allowing the IDF to carry out a genocide, letting people\nstarve, all under the guise of Israel needing to defend itself. Now, with this\nretaliatory action by Iran, even before the rockets have left Iranian\nairspace, Iran is being singled out by these leaders as the main culprit in\nthe conflict, conveniently forgetting that it was one of Israel's many\nprovocations that prompted Iran's counteraction.\n\n6\n\n### Jimmy NYC\n\n15:07\n\nThis was clearly an act of political grandstanding by Iran to save face and\nnot a serious attempt at harming Israel. They telegraphed it days in advance,\nand the number of projectiles was calculated to remain safely within Israel\u2019s\ninterception capabilities. Also the choice of projectiles - extremely high\npercentage of extremely slow drones (literally take hours to arrive) was\ndesigned to give Israel the best possible chances of successfully intercepting\nthem. It\u2019s the kind of political boost that both Israel and Iran needed and it\nwouldn\u2019t surprise me if they were in cahoots at some level. Finally,\nHezbollah\u2019s role was laughably symbolic (a couple of old tech rockets, fired\nat the Golan nevertheless!)\n\nReply to comment\n\n#### To JimmyNYC\n\n15:30Jimmy NYC\n\nYeah. They pardoned Israel.\n\nJimmy, you\u2019re a fan of Tom Cruise I see. \ud83e\udd29\n\n5\n\n### Here facts\n\n15:01\n\nIran struck Nevatim air base with at least seven of its new hypersonic\nmissiles. Nevatim is home to the F-35 fighters that attacked the Iranian\nconsulate in Damascus. Not a single Iranian missile was intercepted. Let that\nsink in. Israel is defenseless.\n\nIF IREAN WANTED TO CUASE LETHAL DAMAGE ANYWHERE IN ISREAL- u cannot stop them\n\nReply to comment\n\n#### To Here facts\n\n15:32Here facts\n\nThey can win Israel with the little finger, buddy. Fan of Connor Mcgregor?\n\n#### Pa\n\n15:36Here facts\n\nCite your source\n\n#### this was not a surprise attack with\n\n15:40Here facts\n\nslow droned bro.. get over it.. however the missiles landed on the the base\ndoing damage\n\n### In the News\n\n##### In the News\n\n  * Israel-Hamas War Live Updates\n  * Iran Attack\n  * Israel - Iran\n  * Iran - Netanyahu\n  * Israel - Hamas\n  * Hezbollah\n  * Israeli Hostages\n\n#### School-day Canceled, Work as Usual: Parents Scramble for Childcare Amid\nIranian Attack\n\n#### Seven-year-old Bedouin Girl Critically Injured by Missile Shrapnel From\nIranian Attack\n\n#### Her Son Came From America to Serve in Israel's Army.
