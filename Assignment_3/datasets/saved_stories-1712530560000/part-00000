It is not your average PalmOS emulator (it does NOT require a\nPalmOS ROM), but it can run m68K PalmOS applications. For a series of articles\ndescribing various aspects of PumpkinOS, look here:\nhttps://pmig96.wordpress.com/category/palmos/.\n\nLauncher is the first application that runs when PumpkinOS starts. It shows a\npanel from which you can start other applications. Preferences will eventually\ncontain all preference options for configuring PumpkinOS. Command is a command\nshell, still experimental.\n\nThis release contains the four PIM applications found on PalmOS: AddressBook,\nMemoPad, ToDoList and DateBook. The source code for these applications were\ndistributed in one or more PalmOS SDks and were adapted for correct\ncompilation on PumpkinOS. Records created by AddressBook and MemoPad should be\ncompatible with their PalmOS counterparts. Because of differences in word size\nen endianness, however, records created by ToDoList and DateBook are not\ncompatible. These applications were tested just to the point where I could\ncreate and edit a few records. There are still some quirks, and some functions\nwere not tested at all. The goal here is just to offer a view of what to\nexpect from PumpkinOS in the future.\n\nI am planing to setup a bug tracker to document enhancements and bugs.\n\n## Licensing\n\nPumpkinOS is licensed under the GPL v3. The license directory contains\ninformation on specific licenses of the various components used in PumpkinOS.\nIf you think something is missing and/or incorrect, please let me know.\n\n## Building\n\nYou have to build PumpkinOS from source. No IDE is required, you can build\nfrom the command line. If you use 64-bits Windows, you can use MSYS2\n(https://www.msys2.org/). Download the installer and follow the instructions\nthere. Open a MINGW64 terminal (the one with the blue 'M' icon) and install\nthese additional packages:\n\n    \n    \n    pacman -S gcc binutils make git\n\nNext clone the PumpkinOS repository:\n\n    \n    \n    git clone https://github.com/migueletto/PumpkinOS.git\n\nFinally go to the source directory of the PumpkinOS repository you have just\ncloned and run the make script:\n\n    \n    \n    cd PumpkinOS/src ./mk.sh Msys 64\n\nIf everything goes well, you will have a pumpkin.exe in the root directory,\nsome DLLs in the bin directory, and some PRC files in the vfs/app_install\ndirectory.\n\nThere is also experimental support for 32-bits Windows (Vista or later. It\nwill not work on Windows XP). Open a MINGW32 terminal (the one with the gray\n'M' icon) and install this additional package:\n\n    \n    \n    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc\n\nFrom there, compile using (note that now argument is 32, for 32-bits):\n\n    \n    \n    cd PumpkinOS/src ./mk.sh Msys 32\n\nIf you are using a 64-bits Linux-based OS (like Debian, Ubuntu, etc), you also\nneed gcc, binutils, make and git. If you are a developer, there is a chance\nyou already have those. If they are not installed, follow the instructions to\ndownload additional packages on your specific Linux distribution. You must\nalso install the SDL2 development package (the package that contains the\nlibraries and the headers). On a Debian distribution, it is probably something\nlike:\n\n    \n    \n    sudo apt install gcc binutils make git libsdl2-dev\n\nAgain, you must clone the repository and compile it using:\n\n    \n    \n    cd PumpkinOS/src ./mk.sh GNU/Linux 64\n\nOn Windows 11 and recent releases of Windows 10, it is also possible to build\nPumpkinOS on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux, version 2). Open a WSL terminal\nand follow the same instructions for a Linux build.\n\n## Running\n\nOn 64-bits Windows, run pumpkin.bat. On 32-bits Windows, run pumpkin32.bat. On\nLinux or WSL, run pumpkin.sh. PumpkinOS will open on a new window. On WSL you\nmay need to run a X-Window Manager, otherwise the PumpkinOS window will not\nhave a border.\n\nWhen you run PumpkinOS, all PRCs inside vfs/app_install will be removed and\nexpanded into folders inside vfs/app_storage. Please keep in mind that\neverything is pretty much experimental at this stage, so expect a few issues\nhere and there. After either a successful or an unsuccessful run, you will\nfind a pumpkin.log file on the root directory. If something goes wrong, look\nfor lines marked with an \"E\" on the third column of this file. You can reach\nme for questions (and send me your log file if you wish).\n\nThe Windows version implements Drag & Drop functionality. You can drag a\nPalmOS PRC over the PumpkinOS window and hopefully it will be installed and\nshow up in the Launcher. The Linux version lacks this functionality. For now,\nyou have to manually copy PRCs to the vfs/app_install directory and restart\nPumpkinOS.\n\nIf you really want to, you can debug PumpkinOS with gdb on Windows, Linux and\nWSL. On Windows, edit pumpkin.bat and change the last line to (you should also\nadd the Windows equivalent of the /usr/bin directory of your MSYS2\ninstallation the the PATH):\n\n    \n    \n    gdb.exe --args .\\pumpkin.exe -d 1 -f pumpkin.log -s libscriptlua.dll script\\pumpkin_windows.lua\n\nOn Linux and WSL edit pumpkin.sh and change the last line to:\n\n    \n    \n    gdb --args ./pumpkin -d 1 -f pumpkin.log -s libscriptlua.so ./script/pumpkin_linux.lua\n\nI am writing a full Wiki article on source level debuging PumpkinOS.\n\n## About\n\nPumpkinOS is a re-implementation of PalmOS.\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nGPL-3.0 license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n144 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n7 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n5 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 2\n\n  * migueletto\n  * classilla Cameron Kaiser\n\n## Languages\n\n  * C 88.9%\n  * POV-Ray SDL 8.5%\n  * C++ 0.7%\n  * Assembly 0.7%\n  * HTML 0.5%\n  * Yacc 0.4%\n  * Other 0.3%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
