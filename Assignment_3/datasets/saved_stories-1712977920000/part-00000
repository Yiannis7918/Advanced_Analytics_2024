Michels had some sharp\ninsights into the nature of bureaucracy, but his \u201ciron law of oligarchy\u201d was\nseriously flawed.\n\nRobert Michels in 1898.

In his most influential work, Michels\nfamously demonstrated the \u201ciron law of oligarchy\u201d that affects even avowedly\ndemocratic political parties, taking as his case study the world\u2019s first\nmillion-strong socialist party, the German Social Democrats (SPD). The\ncritique Michels put forward benefited from his close knowledge of the party\nand its literature \u2014 he had been an active member of the SPD from 1902 to\n1907.\n\nMuch of what Michels argued in 1910\u201311 rings true today. There is at least a\ntendency for large political parties to become dominated by the cadres of\nprofessional functionaries that grow up within their structures. Ordinary\nworkers who make the transition to full-time political professionals typically\ncease to be working class and become something else. The party furnishes\nsocial mobility and relative affluence for a stratum of political\nrepresentatives and paid officials, even as it fails to transform the\nhierarchies of the wider society. Rank-and-file members are unable or\nunwilling to challenge their leaders, even if they sometimes disagree with\nthem.\n\nCritics of contemporary progressive parties still cite Michels \u2014 and if they\ndon\u2019t, they certainly could. Consider the criticisms that have been leveled at\nmachine politics from the creation of \u201cTammany Hall\u201d in the nineteenth century\nto the role of the Democratic National Committee in the era of the Clintons\nand beyond. Or consider the overtly manipulative rule of the UK\u2019s New Labour\nelite under Tony Blair and certain of his successors, with their phalanx of\nadvisers and spin doctors.\n\nLabor and social democratic parties that once had mass memberships have\natrophied as their leaders embraced neoliberalism and the hollowed-out party\nmachinery has become prey to faction bosses and numbers men (and, less\nfrequently, women). We could also mention the way that communist parties in\nSoviet-led Eastern Europe became transformed from workers\u2019 parties in\nopposition to parties of apparatchiks in power as they entered their second or\nthird generation.\n\n# Democracy and Oligarchy\n\nThe work of Michels itself has helped shape our understanding of these\nprocesses. The English edition was republished in 1962 with an introduction by\nthe influential political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset. It soon became a\nsemicanonical text in Cold War\u2013era political science, dovetailing with\ncontemporary analyses of system convergence and the exhaustion of ideology.\n\n\"Political Parties became a semicanonical text in Cold War\u2013era political\nscience and served to help refute socialist projects of transforming society.\"\n\nPolitical Parties served to help refute socialist projects of transforming\nsociety. According to this perspective, the parties that were originally\nformed for such a purpose would sooner or later depart from their democratic\nideals due to the functional necessities of organizations and their innate\ntendencies to succumb to oligarchy.\n\nMichels has also cast a long shadow over the historiography of the German\nlabor movement. His book was a key influence on the landmark study of the\nparty by Guenther Roth, a scholar of Max Weber, which was first published in\n1960.\n\nThe life trajectory of Michels himself also helped dramatize his work\u2019s core\nmessage of the impossibility of democracy and the inevitability of oligarchy.\nAttracted to socialism in the early 1900s as a bourgeois intellectual, fresh\nfrom his doctorate in history, Michels later became an adherent of Benito\nMussolini. He died in 1936 as a professor at the University of Perugia, which\nwas being transformed into an elite academy for future leaders of Italian\nfascism.\n\nFor Cold War\u2013era political science, the path followed by Michels also served\nto confirm the adage of the proximity of the extreme left and the extreme\nright, a tenet of 1950s totalitarianism theory. Even today, one still\nencounters those who espouse the so-called horseshoe theory, which suggests\nthat the extremes of left and right are closer to each other than to the\ncenter.\n\n# Crowd Psychology\n\nSome of the core arguments made by Michels, as hypotheses of political\nsociology, are persuasive. However, when his work is examined more closely in\nits historical context, its limitations become apparent.\n\n\"Even during his years as a socialist activist, Robert Michels seems to have\nhad a limited grasp of Marxist theory.\"\n\nEven during his years as a socialist activist, Michels seems to have had a\nlimited grasp of Marxist theory. He was a product of the widespread bourgeois\ngenerational revolt around 1900, drawn to the challenge of a political\nstruggle against the prevailing conditions in the German Empire, with a\nByzantine, authoritarian monarchy and a militarist culture that his own period\nof army service clearly led him to detest.\n\nIn Marx, Michels saw a kindred spirit \u2014 a bourgeois intellectual who had\nsacrificed his prospects of a comfortable academic career to take up the\nworkers\u2019 struggle. For Michels, socialism was above all an ethical endeavor,\nand middle-class men who took it up proved their ethical superiority. However,\nthe same could not be said for the workers themselves, as they were only\npursuing their own material interests in subscribing to socialist ideology.\n\nThe work of Michels is marked by some of the prevalent thought currents of the\nfin de si\u00e8cle. His theory of oligarchy is clearly influenced by the \u201ccrowd\npsychology\u201d of the anti-socialist and racist writer Gustave le Bon. Michels\nwrites of the innate need of \u201cthe masses\u201d to hero-worship their leaders and\nsubordinate themselves to them.\n\nEthnocentric and racial stereotypes also permeate his writings, although he\ndiffered from German racial theorists in finding Italian national\ncharacteristics more appealing than German. Fluent in Italian, Michels ended\nup embracing Italy as his homeland of choice. While allergic to German\nnationalism and imperialism, he endorsed Italian national aspirations and\neventually supported Italy\u2019s attempts to join the ranks of the imperial\npowers.\n\nHis theory of oligarchy owed an intellectual debt to the Italian elite\ntheorists Gaetano Mosca \u2014 a senior colleague of Michels at the University of\nTurin when he gained a lecturing position there in 1907 \u2014 and Vilfredo Pareto.\nHe also benefited from his friendship with the German social scientists Werner\nSombart and Max Weber. Weber was grappling with the processes of bureaucracy\nand rationalization inherent in developed capitalist societies around this\ntime. Sombart had been an advocate of social reform but became increasingly\nnationalist and anti-socialist in his later years.\n\n# Comrade Herr Doctor\n\nThe question arises as to how reliable the depiction of the German Social\nDemocrats by Michels actually is. He certainly captured one dimension of the\nparty\u2019s evolution. There was more than a mere generational difference between\nthe great nineteenth-century people\u2019s tribunes August Bebel and Wilhelm\nLiebknecht and the party functionaries such as Friedrich Ebert who succeeded\nthem. Michels polemicized against the German trade union leadership for its\ncaution and its refusal to use the unions\u2019 industrial muscle to push for\npolitical change in the German Empire.\n\n\"Michels polemicized against the German trade union leadership for its caution\nand its refusal to use the unions\u2019 industrial muscle to push for political\nchange in the German Empire.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Michels underrated the elements of democracy within the\nSPD, such as the annual party congresses \u2014 a few of which he took part in \u2014\nand the often robust internal debates. Paid party officials, strike funds, and\nmeeting halls also represented tangible gains in the labor movement\u2019s capacity\nto organize, whereas Michels sometimes seems to have believed that\nrevolutionary \u00e9lan and fiery speeches alone could stir up the masses even in\nsleepy rural parts of Germany. While Rosa Luxemburg was unfairly accused of\n\u201cspontaneism,\u201d the term could be better applied to Michels in his radical\nphase.\n\nDuring his active phase as a socialist (1902\u201307), Michels identified with the\nSPD\u2019s left wing, but he was often at odds with other members of the left\ntendency. For example, Michels sided with the Left in the major debate against\nthe revisionists at the Dresden party congress in 1903, but he disagreed with\nhis comrades on one of the core issues of the debate: namely, the Left\u2019s\ncondemnation of Social Democrats who wrote for the bourgeois press.\n\nAt the time, Michels was living as a freelance writer and was remarkably\npromiscuous in contributing to socialist and bourgeois journals alike in\nGermany, Italy, and France (sometimes elsewhere as well). Rosa Luxemburg\noffered to help find Michels a job as an editor of a Social Democratic\nnewspaper (of which there were literally dozens in the early 1900s). However,\nhe never took up this opportunity, whether because he found freelance writing\nmore lucrative, or because he never gave up on his ambition of becoming a\nprofessor at a German university. This was in spite of the fact that Social\nDemocrats were banned by law from teaching at any Prussian university, and\nthere was an unofficial ban on such employment in other states.\n\nPerhaps part of the reason for his belief in the deferential stance of the\nmasses toward their leaders was that his main experience of the party was in\nthe small university town of Marburg, where Michels had taken up residence in\npursuit of his dream of a German university chair. The local SPD group there\nwas tiny, reflecting Marburg\u2019s lack of industry and its rural hinterland, and\nthe intellectual authority of Comrade Herr Doctor Michels seems to have gone\nunquestioned there.\n\n# Luxemburg and Michels\n\nMichels quickly became disillusioned with the failure of the SPD to sideline\nthe revisionist and reformist elements in its ranks, although he remained on\ngood terms with the principal revisionist theoretician Eduard Bernstein and\nregularly contributed to Bernstein\u2019s journal on the history of socialism.\n\nMichels struck up cordial relations with the Italian revolutionary\nsyndicalists around Arturo Labriola and contributed numerous articles to the\nFrench revolutionary syndicalist journal Le Mouvement Socialiste. Other\ncontributors to Le Mouvement Socialiste included Georges Sorel, the author of\nReflections on Violence. For all its radicalism, the journal lacked any\nsignificant working-class support base.\n\n\"Michels carefully distanced himself from syndicalism, despite his\ntemperamental sympathy for the revolutionary zeal of its radical wing.\"\n\nDespite his sympathies for, and friendship with, French and Italian radical\nsyndicalists, Michels never really identified as a syndicalist, even when he\nrepresented the Italian syndicalists at the 1907 Stuttgart Socialist\nInternational Congress. A stern critic of the German trade unions, Michels did\nnot believe that trade union work could replace the political struggle, and he\nbelieved that the iron law of oligarchy applied just as much to trade unions\nas to political parties.\n\nMichels carefully distanced himself from syndicalism, despite his\ntemperamental sympathy for the revolutionary zeal of its radical wing. This is\na point that has been missed by interpretations of Michels that view him as\njumping straight from the revolutionary left to the far right in an\nillustration of the notorious horseshoe theory. In fact, after Michels became\ndisillusioned with socialism, he became closer to conservative liberal\npositions, taking up a professorship in economics in the Swiss town of Basel\non the eve of World War I, only to move further right later.\n\nInterpretations of Michels as a disillusioned democratic idealist \u2014 a man who\nessentially longed for direct democracy in the spirit of Jean-Jacques\nRousseau, and abhorred the dilution of the people\u2019s will that would inevitably\noccur in representative parliamentary democracy \u2014 underestimate his affinity\nwith elite theory. Michels was also less committed to democracy per se than to\nan ideal of a life of struggle, which would enable the ethically superior\nindividual to prove themselves.\n\n\"Michels ultimately found his own charismatic leader in the shape of Benito\nMussolini.\"\n\nSome recent writers on Michels have sought to emphasize the optimistic\npedagogical aspect of his works, and his suggestion that the people could\neventually be trained to govern themselves. But his own political trajectory\nsuggests that his pessimistic assessment of the democratic socialist project\nultimately got the better of him.\n\nThere are points of contact between his critique of the bureaucratization of\nGerman Social Democracy and the arguments of Rosa Luxemburg, who once viewed\nhim as an ally. Both Michels and Luxemburg were scathing of the caution of the\nGerman trade union functionaries, for example, and the attachment of the\nlatter to their organizations and strike funds as ends in themselves.\n\nYet while Luxemburg argued for a dynamic and reciprocal relationship between\nthe party and its mass following, which would raise the revolutionary class\nconsciousness of workers through activism, Michels seems to have retained his\nbelief that the workers had an innate need to venerate their leaders, and only\ncharismatic leadership could shake them out of their passivity. It is a matter\nof historical record that Michels ultimately found his own charismatic leader\nin the shape of Benito Mussolini.\n\n#### Share this article\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\n#### Contributors\n\nAndrew Bonnell is an associate professor of history at the University of\nQueensland.
