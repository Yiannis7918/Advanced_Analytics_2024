I saw a video from \"The King of Random\u201d (TKOR) and thought it was\nsuch a good idea I had to try it for myself. The solar death ray is made from\ntaking the Fresnel lens or \u201cmagnifying lens\u201d out of older big screen TV\u2019s (the\nlast production models don\u2019t have clear lenses and don\u2019t work as well). Once\nyou have this lens all you have to do is build a frame and get to frying!!!\nThe power of the lens is remarkable. It will light a piece of wood on fire\nwith in seconds and will even melt pennies! It\u2019s estimated that the death ray\ncan get up to 2000 degrees Fahrenheit (1093 Degrees Celsius). We did learn\nthat just like mirrors reflecting lasers the death ray has one weakness...\nanything that is the color white! golf balls, white sand, white eggs, and\nflour all reflected the intense light and did not melt, burn or explode as we\nthought would happen. We will certainly bust this gem back out and get to\nmelting more things in the near future!
