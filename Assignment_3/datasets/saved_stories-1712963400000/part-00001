It said to the turtle\nof the Eastern Sea, \"I am so happy! I jump about the railings of the well,\nrest at the crack on the bricks; when I dive into the water, they support my\narms and chin; when I scramble in the mud, they bury my feet and toes. I\ninteract with crabs and play with minnows; nobody can compare to me.\nFurthermore, I dominate the water in this well, and enjoy the joy of being in\nthe well. Isn't it wonderful? Why don't you come down and have a look?\" The\nturtle of the Eastern Sea tried to get in the well, but before his left leg\ncould even enter, his right knee was already stuck. So, it circled around and\nwent back, and told the frog, \"A thousand miles cannot describe its vastness;\na thousand fathoms cannot measure its depth. In the time of Yu, there were\nfloods nine out of ten years, yet the sea did not increase; in the time of\nTang, there were droughts seven out of eight years, yet the cliffs did not\ndecrease. The sea does not change with the passing of time or the amount of\nwater it contains, this is the great joy of the Eastern Sea.\" When the frog in\nthe well heard this, it was astonished and could not find words to reply.\"\n\nThe Chinese text is a parable known as \"The Frog in the Well\" attributed to\nZhuangzi, a Taoist philosopher. The story has been used to illustrate various\nthemes in Eastern philosophy and its central message is about narrow-\nmindedness and limited perspective. The frog, having lived its entire life in\na well, has a limited perspective of the world, which is challenged when it\nencounters the turtle from the Eastern Sea.\n\nThis parable is widely used in Chinese culture to refer to someone with a\nlimited perspective or a narrow understanding of things. The saying \"a frog in\na well\" (\u4e95\u5e95\u4e4b\u86d9, j\u01d0ng d\u01d0 zh\u012b w\u0101) is often used to describe a person with a\nlimited outlook who doesn't know the immensity of the world.\n\nThe characters \u6771\u6d77 (d\u014dng h\u01cei) refer to the Eastern Sea, often used in Chinese\nliterature to refer to the sea to the east of China. This vast body of water\nis used to contrast with the small well where the frog lives.\n\nThe Chinese language often resorts to indirect and metaphorical language, and\nthis parable is rich in such language. For example, the phrases \"\u652f\u814b\u6301\u9890\"\n(literally \"support the armpits and hold the chin\") and \"\u6ca1\u8db3\u706d\u8dd7\" (literally\n\"bury the feet and extinguish the toes\") describe the frog's movements in the\nwell, making the small well seem quite comfortable for the frog.\n\nHowever, when the turtle tries to enter the small well and finds it\nimpossible, it reveals to the frog the vastness of the Eastern Sea, which\nremains unchanged despite fluctuations in weather over the years. The story\nconcludes with the frog being stunned - a metaphor for someone realizing the\nlimit of their knowledge or perspective. - H.E.S\n\n## Title[edit | edit source]\n\nThe names the frog of the bottom of the well (\u4e95\u5e95\u4e4b\u86d9) and glancing at the sky\nfrom the bottom of the well (\u5750\u4e95\u89c0\u5929) were not original titles by Chuang-tzu. The\nphilosopher has given the fable no title. Such titles have been made up by\nothers. In fact, the common interpretation of a frog in a well is incorrect.\nBack then, the word \u4e95 meant 'trap' (now written as '\u9631').\n\nNowadays, both titles have been used as an idiom. The former means a person\nwhose knowledge is so limited that he or she has no idea about anything aside\nfrom the world of their own; the latter means the action of being the kind of\nperson mentioned above. Here is an example sentence using both idioms:\n\n> \u4ed6\u7d93\u5e38\u5728\u4eba\u5bb6\u9762\u524d\u8ce3\u5f04\u5730\u7406\u77e5\u8b58,\u5176\u5be6,\u4ed6\u53ea\u4e0d\u904e\u662f\u500b\u4e95\u5e95\u4e4b\u86d9\u800c\u5df2\u3002\u6211\u9084\u662f\u52f8\u4ed6\u5225\u5750\u4e95\u89c0\u5929\u597d\u4e86\u3002\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n> He always shows off his geographical knowledge in front of others, yet he is\n> simply an ignorant frog of the bottom of the well. I guess I'll advise him\n> to stop glancing at the sky from the bottom of the well.\n\n## Footnotes[edit | edit source]\n\n  1. \u2191 The original text: \u5b50\u7368\u4e0d\u805e\u592b\u57f3\u4e95\u4e4b\u9f03\u4e4e?\u8b02\u6771\u6d77\u4e4b\u9c49\u66f0:\u300e\u543e\u6a02\u8207!\u51fa\u8df3\u6881\u4e4e\u4e95\u5e79\u4e4b\u4e0a,\u5165\u4f11\u4e4e\u7f3a\u7503\u4e4b\u5d16;\u8d74\u6c34\u5247\u63a5\u814b\u6301\u9824,\u8e76\u6ce5\u5247\u6c92\u8db3\u6ec5\u8dd7;\u9084\u8677\u87f9\u8207\u79d1\u6597,\u83ab\u543e\u80fd\u82e5\u4e5f\u3002\u4e14\u592b\u64c5\u4e00\u58d1\u4e4b\u6c34,\u800c\u8de8\u8df1\u57f3\u4e95\u4e4b\u6a02,\u6b64\u4ea6\u81f3\u77e3,\u592b\u5b50\u595a\u4e0d\u6642\u4f86\u5165\u89c0\u4e4e!\u300f\u6771\u6d77\u4e4b\u9c49\u5de6\u8db3\u672a\u5165,\u800c\u53f3\u819d\u5df2\u7e36\u77e3\u3002\u65bc\u662f\u9021\u5de1\u800c\u537b,\u544a\u4e4b\u6d77\u66f0:\u300e\u592b\u5343\u91cc\u4e4b\u9060,\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8209\u5176\u5927;\u5343\u4ede\u4e4b\u9ad8,\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6975\u5176\u6df1\u3002\u79b9\u4e4b\u6642\u5341\u5e74\u4e5d\u6f66,\u800c\u6c34\u5f17\u70ba\u52a0\u76ca;\u6e6f\u4e4b\u6642\u516b\u5e74\u4e03\u65f1,\u800c\u5d16\u4e0d\u70ba\u52a0\u640d\u3002\u592b\u4e0d\u70ba\u9803\u4e45\u63a8\u79fb,\u4e0d\u4ee5\u591a\u5c11\u9032\u9000\u8005,\u6b64\u4ea6\u6771\u6d77\u4e4b\u5927\u6a02\u4e5f\u3002\u300f\u65bc\u662f\u57f3\u4e95\u4e4b\u9f03\u805e\u4e4b,\u9069\u9069\u7136\u9a5a,\u898f\u898f\u7136\u81ea\u5931\u4e5f\u3002\n\nRetrieved from\n\"https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_Stories/The_frog_of_the_well&oldid=4388041\"\n\nCategory:\n\n  * Book:Chinese Stories\n\n## Navigation menu\n\n### Search\n\n  * This page was last edited on 10 April 2024, at 12:30.\n  * Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License; additional terms may apply.
