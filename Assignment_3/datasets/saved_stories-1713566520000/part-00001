The millions of punched cards created\nfor the population counted in the national census could then be sorted on the\nbasis of specific bits of information they contained\u2014thereby providing a\nquantified portrait of the nation and its citizens.^[2]^: 25 A circuit-closing\ndevice was used to electromagnetically record the data represented by the\nperforations. The technology enabled searching for individuals using the\ntraits as search terms.^[3]\n\nIn 1910, the German licensee Willy Heidinger established the Deutsche\nHollerith Maschinen Gesellschaft (German Hollerith Machine Corporation), known\nby the abbreviation \"Dehomag\".^[2]^: 30 The next year, Hollerith sold his\nAmerican business to industrialist Charles Flint (1850\u20131934) for US$1.41\nmillion (equivalent to $46.1 million in 2023).^[2]^: 31 The counting machine\noperation was made part of a new conglomerate called the Computing-Tabulating-\nRecording Company (CTR).^[2]^: 31 Flint chose Thomas J. Watson (1874\u20131956),\nthe star salesman of the National Cash Register Corporation, to head the new\noperation.^[2]^: 38\u201339 In 1923,^[4] the German licensee Dehomag became a\ndirect subsidiary of the American corporation CTR.^[2]^: 44 In 1924, Watson\nassumed the role of Chief Executive Officer of CTR and renamed the company\nInternational Business Machines (IBM).\n\nBlack details an ongoing business relationship between Watson's IBM and the\nemerging German regime headed by Adolf Hitler and his National Socialist\nGerman Workers Party (NSDAP). Hitler came to power in January 1933; on March\n20 of that same year he established a concentration camp for political\nprisoners in the Bavarian town of Dachau, just outside the city of Munich.\nRepression against political opponents and the country's ethnic Jewish\npopulation began immediately. By April 1933, some 60,000 had been\nimprisoned.^[2]^: 44\u201345 Business relations between IBM and the Hitler regime\ncontinued uninterrupted in the face of broad international calls for an\neconomic boycott.^[2]^: 45 Willy Heidinger, who remained the chief executive\nof Dehomag, the German subsidiary of which IBM owned 90%, was an enthusiastic\nsupporter of the Hitler regime.^[2]^: 50\n\nOn April 12, 1933, the German government announced plans to conduct a long-\ndelayed national census.^[2]^: 54 The project was particularly important to\nthe Nazis as a mechanism for the identification of Jews, Roma, and other\nethnic groups deemed undesirable by the regime. Dehomag offered to assist the\nGerman government in its task of ethnic identification, focusing upon the 41\nmillion residents of Prussia.^[2]^: 55 This activity was not only countenanced\nby Thomas Watson and IBM in America, Black argues, but was actively encouraged\nand financially supported, with Watson himself traveling to Germany in October\n1933 and the company ramping up its investment in its German subsidiary from\n400,000 to 7,000,000 Reichsmark\u2014about $1 million (equivalent to $23.5 million\nin 2023).^[2]^: 60 This injection of American capital allowed Dehomag to\npurchase land in Berlin and to construct IBM's first factory in Germany, Black\ncharges, thereby \"tooling up for what it correctly saw as a massive financial\nrelationship with the Hitler regime\".^[2]^: 60\n\nBlack also cites documents regarding a \"secret deal\" that was made between\nHeidinger and Watson during the latter's visit to Germany which allowed\nDehomag commercial powers outside of Germany, enabling the \"now Nazified\"\ncompany to \"circumvent and supplant\" various national subsidiaries and\nlicensees by \"soliciting and delivering punch card solution technology\ndirectly to IBM customers in those territories\".^[2]^: 61 As a result, Nazi\nGermany soon became the second most important customer of IBM after the\nlucrative U.S. market.^[2]^: 110 The 1933 census, with design help and\ntabulation services provided by IBM through its German subsidiary, proved to\nbe pivotal to the Nazis in their efforts to identify, isolate, and ultimately\ndestroy the country's Jewish minority. Machine-tabulated census data greatly\nexpanded the estimated number of Jews in Germany by identifying individuals\nwith only one or a few Jewish ancestors. Previous estimates of 400,000 to\n600,000 were abandoned for a new estimate of 2 million Jews in the nation of\n65 million.^[2]^: 110\n\nAs the Nazi war machine occupied successive nations of Europe, capitulation\nwas followed by a census of the population of each subjugated nation, with an\neye to the identification and isolation of Jews and Romani. These census\noperations were intimately intertwined with technology and cards supplied by\nIBM's German and new Polish subsidiaries, which were awarded specific sales\nterritories in Poland by decision of the New York office following Germany's\nsuccessful Blitzkrieg invasion.^[2]^: 193 Data generated by means of counting\nand alphabetization equipment supplied by IBM through its German and other\nnational subsidiaries was instrumental in the efforts of the German government\nto concentrate and ultimately destroy ethnic Jewish populations across\nEurope.^[2]^: 198 Black reports that every Nazi concentration camp maintained\nits own Hollerith-Abteilung (Hollerith Department), assigned with keeping tabs\non inmates through use of IBM's punchcard technology.^[2]^: 351 In his book,\nBlack charges that \"without IBM's machinery, continuing upkeep and service, as\nwell as the supply of punch cards, whether located on-site or off-site,\nHitler's camps could have never managed the numbers they did.\"^[2]^: 352\n\nMajor changes were made for the 2002 paperback editions on Three Rivers\nPress/Time Warner Paperbacks^[5]^[6]^[7] and the 2012 expanded edition on\nDialog Press.^[8] In the updated 2002 paperback edition, the author included\nnew evidence of the connection between IBM's United States headquarters and\nits Polish subsidiary during Nazi occupation.^[5]^[6]^[7] In 2012 Black\npublished a second expanded revision with more documents. The 2012 expanded\nedition provides 32 pages of new photographic and documentary evidence.^[8]\n\n### IBM's post-invasion Polish subsidiary[edit]\n\nA revised 2002 paperback edition provides additional evidence that IBM New\nYork established a special subsidiary in Poland called Watson Business\nMachines to deal with railway traffic in the General Government. Edwin Black\nasserts that IBM did so after the September 1, 1939 Invasion of Poland by\nGermany, and continued this business relationship during the Holocaust in\nPoland. Watson Business Machines operated a punch card printing shop near the\nWarsaw Ghetto.^[5]\n\nIn a 2002 editorial in the SFGate, Black documented that this Polish\nsubsidiary reported to IBM Geneva which in turn reported to IBM New York.\nBlack further states that IBM's European general manager reported directly to\nThomas Watson Sr., that some machines in Poland were sent to Romania to assist\nin the Jewish census there, and that these Polish machines were later\nreplaced.^[6]\n\nIn his book, Black quotes Leon Krzemieniecki, the last surviving person\ninvolved in the administration of the rail transportation to Auschwitz and\nTreblinka, as stating he knew the punched card machines were not German\nmachines, because the labels were in English. Black details how income from\nthe machines leased in Poland was sent through Geneva to IBM in New\nYork.^[5]^[6]\n\n### Ongoing sales[edit]\n\nEdwin Black details how IBM not only leased Nazi Germany the machines, but\nthen provided continuous maintenance service, and sold the spare parts and the\nspecial paper needed for the customized punch cards.^[9]\n\n> No machines were sold \u2013 only leased. IBM was the sole source of all punch\n> cards and spare parts. It serviced the machines on site either directly or\n> through its authorized dealer network or field trainees. There were no\n> universal punch cards. Each series of cards was custom-designed by IBM\n> engineers to capture information going in and to tabulate information the\n> Nazis wanted to extract.\n>\n> \u2014 Edwin Black, on updates in 2002^[6]\n\nAfter the publication of the 2012 expanded edition, he wrote for the\nHuffington Post, \"The punch cards, machinery, training, servicing, and special\nproject work, such as population census and identification, was managed\ndirectly by IBM headquarters in New York, and later through its subsidiaries\nin Germany, known as Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen Gesellschaft (DEHOMAG),\nPoland, The Netherlands, France, Switzerland, and other European countries.\"\nHe added that the punch cards bore the indicia of the German subsidiary\nDehomag.^[10]\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n### IBM's response[edit]\n\nThough IBM has never directly denied any of the evidence posed by the book, it\nhas criticized Black's research methods and accusatory conclusions.^[11] IBM\nclaimed it does not have any other information about the company during its\nWorld War II period or the operations of Dehomag, as it argued most documents\nwere destroyed or lost during the war.^[12]\n\nIBM also claimed that an earlier dismissed lawsuit, initiated by lawyers\nrepresenting concentration camp survivors, was filed in 2001 to coincide with\nBlack's book launch.^[12] Lawyers for the Holocaust victims acknowledged the\ntiming of the lawsuit to coincide with Black's book release, explaining their\npublic relations strategies played an important role in their record of\nachieving Nazi-era settlements totaling more than $7 billion without winning a\njudgment.^[13]\n\nAfter the publication of Black's updated 2002 paperback edition, IBM responded\nby stating it wasn't convinced there were any new findings and there was no\nproof IBM had enabled the Holocaust.^[5]^[7] IBM rejected Black's assertion\nthat IBM was hiding information and records regarding its World War II\nera.^[14] Several years previously, IBM had given its corporate records of the\nperiod to academic archives in New York and Stuttgart, Germany, for review by\nundefined \"independent scholars\".^[7]\n\nIn early 2021, Black published the 20th anniversary edition with special\npublic events and a syndicated article stating that in twenty years, \"not a\ncomma has been changed\", adding that \"IBM has never requested a correction or\ndenied any facts in the book.\"^[15]^[16]^[17]\n\n#### Wikipedia editing controversy[edit]\n\nIn 2010, Black reported on unidentified Wikipedia editors marginalizing his\nresearch on IBM's role in the Holocaust.^[18] It is not clear whether the\neditors involved were IBM employees, but Black states that, \"[they were]\nopenly fortified by official IBM corporate archivist Paul Lasewicz using his\nreal name, and others\"; Black nevertheless calls Lasewicz a \"man of integrity\"\nand points out that he deferred taking the lead because of potential conflict\nof interest and then recused himself entirely.^[19]^[20]\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\nThe book was published on February 11, 2001, simultaneously in 40 countries in\n14 languages, with numerous subsequent expanded editions, and hundreds of\npublished reviews in many languages have appeared.^[10]\n\nAt the first edition release in 2001, Newsweek called the book \"explosive\",\nadding, \"backed by exhaustive research, Black's case is simple and stunning.\n... Black clearly demonstrates that Nazi Germany employed IBM Hollerith punch-\ncard machines to perform critical tasks in carrying out the Holocaust and the\nGerman war effort ... Black establishes beyond dispute that IBM Hollerith\nmachines significantly advanced Nazi efforts to exterminate Jewry.\"^[21]\n\nIn 2003, the American Society of Journalists and Authors acknowledged IBM and\nthe Holocaust with its award for Best Non-Fiction Book of the Year.^[22]\n\nRichard Bernstein, writing for The New York Times Book Review about the\noriginal 2001 first edition, said \"Edwin Black makes a copiously documented\ncase for the utter amorality of the profit motive and its indifference to\nconsequences\" but that Black's case \"is long and heavily documented, and yet\nhe does not demonstrate that IBM bears some unique or decisive responsibility\nfor the evil that was done\".^[23]\n\nIn a 2001 review in the Los Angeles Times, historian and UCLA professor Saul\nFriedlander wrote, \"The author convincingly shows the relentless efforts made\nby IBM to maximize profit by selling its machines and its punch cards to a\ncountry whose criminal record would soon be widely recognized. Indeed, Black\ndemonstrates with great precision that the godlike owner of the corporation,\nThomas Watson, was impervious to the moral dimension of his dealings with\nHitler's Germany and for years even had a soft spot for the Nazi regime.\"^[24]\n\nIn another review of the first edition, David Cesarani of Southampton\nUniversity stated that Black provided \"shocking evidence\" that IBM in America\ncontinued to provide punch cards and other services to the Nazis \"in defiance\nof Allied regulations against trading with the enemy.\"^[25]\n\nIn a 2001 review of the first edition in The Atlantic, Jack Beatty wrote,\n\"This is a shocking book ... Edwin Black has documented a sordid relationship\nbetween this great American company and the Third Reich, one that extended\ninto the war years.\"\n\nProf. Robert Urekew's review in the Harvard International Review stated:\n\"Black's meticulous documentation reveals an undeniable fact: after the\noutbreak of the World War II, the IBM corporation knew the whereabouts of each\nof its European-leased machines, and what revenues it could expect from\nthem.\"^[26]\n\nAfter the updated paperback edition in 2002, Oliver Burkeman wrote for The\nGuardian, \"The paperback provides the first evidence that the company's\ndealings with the Nazis were controlled from its New York headquarters\nthroughout the second world war.\"^[5] Sam Jaffe in Businessweek wrote: \"With\nexhaustive research, Black makes the case that IBM and Watson conspired with\nNazi Germany to help automate the genocide of Europe's Jews.\"^[citation\nneeded]\n\nReuters reported in 2002 that historians on Black's research team stated the\npaperback edition had used newly discovered Nazi documents and Polish\neyewitness testimony to link IBM's U.S. operations directly to the Third Reich\noperations in Poland.^[citation needed]\n\nSeveral reviewers publicly retracted their negative reviews, with signed\nwritten apologies and donations to Holocaust museums, including reviewers in\nThe Jerusalem Report, Nature Magazine, AudioFile magazine, Annals of the\nHistory of Computing, and the World Association of International\nScholars.^[27]\n\n## Related legal actions[edit]\n\nIn February 2001, an Alien Tort Claims Act claim was filed in U.S. federal\ncourt against IBM for allegedly providing the punched card technology that\nfacilitated the Holocaust, and for covering up German IBM subsidiary Dehomag's\nactivities.^[13]^[28] There was no evidence in the suit that IBM officials in\nNew York explicitly ordered that technology be supplied to the Nazis with the\nunderstanding it would be used in concentration camps; however, lawyers\nrepresenting victims of Nazi oppression claimed Dehomag's founder Heidinger\nexpressed pride in giving Hitler data that could be used in \"corrective\ninterventions\", and pledged to \"follow his orders blindly\".^[13] In April\n2001, the lawsuit was dropped after lawyers feared the suit would slow down\npayments from a German Holocaust fund for Holocaust survivors who had suffered\nunder Nazi persecution.^[28] IBM's German division had paid $3 million into\nthe fund, while clearly avoiding admission of liability.^[28]\n\nIn 2004, the Roma human rights organization Gypsy International Recognition\nand Compensation Action (GIRCA) filed suit against IBM in Switzerland.^[28]\nHowever, the case was dismissed in 2006 under the relevant statute of\nlimitations.^[29]\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said in a 2015 unrelated lawsuit\nfiled in U.S. federal court against IBM, \"We point out the disturbing\nparallels between IBM's actions vis-\u00e0-vis South Africa and Nazi Germany: IBM\nNew York purposefully 'facilitated gross human rights abuses by the Third\nReich.'\"^[30]^[31]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Alfred P.
