Needed. Timeless.\nAnd everyone\u2019s in favor.\n\nBut, alas, when you drill in, the conversation often goes something like this:\n\n> DK: So what are you focused on? CEO: Mid-market (MM). DK: Do you sell\n> anywhere else? CEO: Yes, for sure. A lot of today\u2019s SMB companies will be\n> mid-market tomorrow, so we want to catch them on the way up. CEO: Oh, and\n> today\u2019s MMs will be enterprises (ENT) one day, so we sell to them too \u2014 so\n> we can learn their product requirements \u2013and our customers can grow without\n> fear. I mean, we\u2019d never want a customer to outgrow our platform. DK: OK,\n> but what about our marketing, do we have any focus there? CEO: Well, you\n> know, you can\u2019t really control who clicks on a Google ad, so we can get\n> inbound from SMB, MM, and ENT. We can control geography though. We don\u2019t run\n> ads in Florin or Genovia. DK: But those are fictional countries from\n> princess movies. How about LinkedIn, you get a lot more control there? CEO:\n> We\u2019re not doing as much on LinkedIn. Leads are more expensive. DK: (Thinking\n> that maybe they\u2019re higher quality and more aligned to strategy.) How about\n> industries? CEO: No, we\u2019re a horizontal play. We have customers in banking,\n> healthcare, pharma, insurance, energy, and retail/CPG. And many others. DK:\n> Any focus on use-cases? CEO: Yes. But no. No, we\u2019re a platform play. That\u2019s\n> the beauty. We have an integrated platform that can support dozens of\n> strategic use-cases. So, really, yes and no. DK: So you\u2019re focused on\n> everything. All size segments, all geos, all industries, and all use-cases?\n> CEO: Yes. We love focus so much that we have a whole bunch of them. Go big\n> or go home.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m thinking three things:\n\n  * My Latin teacher, Mr. Maddaloni, taught me that focus was singular.\n  * The founder of Southwest Airlines always said that to get big you should think small.\n  * This is why Geoffrey Moore wrote Crossing the Chasm and Inside the Tornado.\n\nAs it turns out, a quick nod to the chasm gods is a lot easier than embracing\nthem. In the rest of this post, I\u2019ll share some tools I use to detect real vs.\nfaux focus and that you can use to sharpen focus in general.\n\n  * An ideal customer customer profile (ICP) with concentric circles. Sometimes it\u2019s too binary to have ICP and non-ICP customers, with the result that everything gets equal treatment. Instead, treat your ICP like a bulls eye. Ring zero is credit unions of size X with use-case 1. Ring one is banks of size X with use-case 1. Ring two is insurance companies of size X with use-case 1. Ring three is financial institutions of size X with use-case 2. Ring four is everyone else. I find this increases focus, especially when the inner rings are variations on a core.\n  * Define the idea of strategic vs. opportunistic revenue. Look, I\u2019ve run startups. Cash is king. You want to give me money, I\u2019ll take it. As long as there are no strings attached. Startups get in trouble when they draw-and-quarter themselves by selling roadmap (i.e., non-existing) features to a diverse set of customers. That\u2019s why you should define strategic revenue (e.g., in the first three ICP rings) vs. opportunistic revenue and then religiously enforce this rule: if it\u2019s oportunistic revenue you have to sell what\u2019s on the truck. Don\u2019t even bother asking for roadmap commitments. Maybe give those sellers lower quotas in return. But don\u2019t let them ruin your future by selling your scarcest resource, R&D capacity, for non-strategic purposes.\n  * Segmented metrics. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re strong in SMB and your growth strategy is a big up-market push into MM. All of your reported metrics quickly become a variably weighted blend of two different businesses. You\u2019ll find yourself in board meetings saying things like, \u201cwell the average sales price isn\u2019t that meaningful because it\u2019s a blend of SMB deals at $10K and MM deals at $40K.\u201d For that matter, neither are average sales cycle, close rate, win rate, loss-to, and other metrics. So, segment these metrics: present SMB, MM, and total (aka, \u201cblended\u201d) figures. The same goes for industries and use-cases. Sometimes you\u2019re doing great on the new strategy but the core business is collapsing faster than you thought. Sometimes, the core business is going gangbusters and you\u2019ve made no progress on the new strategy. Without segmented metrics, you can\u2019t easily tell.\n  * Not-on-list lists. Planning is an additive process at most startups. \u201cLet\u2019s do this and this and this. Forget anything? OK, let\u2019s add that, too!\u201d To sharpen your focus, add a subtractive element. When you discuss something and decide not to do it, capture that in a not-on-list list. Think: here\u2019s the list of things we decided to do, and here\u2019s a list of things we considered and decided not to do. It will both help your current focus and shorten subsequent debate (think of the asked and answered objection in court).\n  * Split business units. If you\u2019re constantly arguing it\u2019s actually two different businesses that happen to share a go-to-market (GTM) team, then consider splitting the GTM team. Back in the day at MarkLogic, we had two unlikely bedfellows as businesses: intelligence and media (aka spies and publishers). It helped that our staff literally couldn\u2019t attend meetings in the other segment (e.g., security clearances). So we split our business in two: media and federal. We didn\u2019t have SCs, we had media SCs. We didn\u2019t have consultants, we had federal consultants. We didn\u2019t have a CRO, we had a VP of media and a VP of federal. While this is a pretty extreme approach, in certain situations \u2014 particularly when the businesses are pretty far apart \u2014 it might make sense. We had two different distribution businesses atop a shared product foundation.\n\nI hope this post has given you a few ideas on how to test your own focus, how\nto sharpen it, and how to report on it.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n  * Print\n  * More\n\n  * Pinterest\n  * Facebook\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nThis entry was posted in Entrepreneurship, Metrics, SaaS, Sales, Startups,\nStrategy and tagged Focus.

Albeit it\u2019s harder\nto execute on it when a pile of cash presents itself.\n\nThis is where strong product leadership can help, to separate signal from\nnoise and have deep focus on the bullseye.\n\nLoading...\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
