You\u2019ll play a pivotal role in a cyber security team with a\ngreat starting salary and progression.\n\nBefore we get any further, there are several myths we want to dispel right\naway:\n\n  * I need a degree for a cyber security career Not true! We\u2019ve learned from so many people who have launched their cyber security career long after university, often studying something completely unrelated (or not attending university at all!) If this was ever a requirement, it\u2019s definitely a thing of the past with the huge amount of content available to you online\n  * I need eight different certifications to show employers I\u2019m ready You don\u2019t. Employers want to see your mastery of the technical side, yes, but there are better ways to do this. For example, a portfolio of practical projects. Some examinations do include a practical component which is great, but they can also be expensive!\n  * It\u2019s too difficult to do alone With TryHackMe, you\u2019ll never do this alone. We have 210 000 Discord members offering support, guidance, and inspiration every day. From careers advice to help with specific challenges, you\u2019ll get your questions answered fast right here on our platform.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Demand for this role is OUTRAGEOUS at the moment:\nthere are millions of cyber security analyst jobs available.\n\nRead on as we break down each step you\u2019ll need to take to kickstart your\ncareer.\n\n### What is a SOC Analyst?\n\nCybersecurity analysts work in a SOC. First: let\u2019s tackle the acronym. SOC\nstands for Security Operations Centre, the central security unit tasked with\nprotecting a company against security threats.\n\nThe cybersecurity analyst is a front-line role in identifying threats and\nvulnerabilities, as well as implementing tools to help the team tackle them\n\nGenerally, you\u2019ll move through tiers as you progress in the SOC Analyst role.\nAt Level 1, you\u2019ll be responsible for identifying and investigating threats\nbefore escalating them.\n\nYou\u2019ll escalate these threats to a Level 2 analyst, who with a little more\nexperience can investigate threats further, prioritise, and form a response.\n\nThe Level 3 analyst has a great amount of responsibility for the overall\nsecurity picture, and will support the team in threat detection and response.\nAnother key part of this role is upskilling, so you can expect to spend a lot\nof time researching emerging exploits and their solutions.\n\nWith enough experience as an Analyst, you\u2019ll progress to SOC Manager and\nthere's no limit to how far you can go. Someday you\u2019ll reach the holy grail of\nCISO (if you define holy grail as \u201cperson with ultimate responsibility for the\ndigital health of an organisation\u201d).\n\n### Why Be a Cybersecurity Analyst?\n\nAs an entry route into cyber security, the cybersecurity analyst role brings\nso many benefits to your hard and soft skills. You will:\n\n  * Develop your critical thinking\n  * Take up numerous opportunities to further your knowledge\n  * Learn how to operate in a team\n  * Sharpen your presentation and communication skills\n  * Handle huge responsibility\n\n### Is the Cybersecurity Analyst Role a Fit for You?\n\nDo you have a sharp eye for detail? Ever thought of yourself as a detective?\nCan you work under pressure? If you answered yes to these questions, the cyber\nsecurity analyst career path might be just right for you.\n\nFurther down, we explore the requirements you\u2019ll need to perform the role\nwell. Here, we\u2019re talking about mindset. How do you know if you\u2019re the right\nkind of person to operate in a SOC environment?\n\nDetermined\n\nYou\u2019ve got to dig deep to uncover threats. You might perform dozens of the\nsame routine check everyday and find no problems. But you have to stay\nswitched on for the moment something doesn\u2019t look right.\n\nSelf-motivated\n\nThings move quickly in the security operations centre. Before you\u2019ve had time\nto celebrate one win, a new threat creeps in.\n\nCurious\n\nThey say you learn something new every day. This is not a cliche phrase for\nSOC Analysts - in the course of your investigations, you\u2019ll encounter so much\ninformation. If you like the idea of expanding your knowledge, this is a good\nfit.\n\nMission-oriented\n\nYou\u2019re the guardian of a company\u2019s online security! That\u2019s a bold task, with\ngreat responsibility. If you get value from being the (sometimes unsung) hero,\nthis is an opportunity to play a decisive role.\n\nCalm\n\nYou are inheriting the responsibility of protecting a company\u2019s digital\nassets. There will be times of great pressure. SOC Analysts can set that to\none side and focus on the goal.\n\n### Learn from a Pro:\n\n### Hyden\n\nHayden used TryHackMe to start a career in cybersecurity. Now, he\u2019s a SOC\nAnalyst, and he loves it.\n\nThe SOC has always been attractive to me - while combing through logs may\nsound boring to some, to me it feels like a treasure hunt. It will be an\nexcellent opportunity for me to learn about various defensive tools while also\ngaining knowledge about different TTPs. I hope it can someday lead to a\nposition in threat hunting.\n\n## Skills for a Cybersecurity Analyst\n\n### What Technical Skills Do I Need to be a Cybersecurity Analyst?\n\nLet\u2019s work back from the job description. Here are a few we\u2019ve taken from the\ninternet.\n\nRead enough of these, and the usual suspects start to crop up. Let\u2019s break\ndown the core capabilities required.\n\n  * Monitor infrastructure and digital assets for any malicious activity\n  * Respond to alerts and investigate incidents depending on the severity of these alerts\n  * Plan for disaster recovery and create contingency plans in the event of any security breaches\n  * Work with different departments and stakeholders within an organisation to draft and review security policies and processes\n  * Identify potential weaknesses and implement measures, such as firewalls and encryption\n  * Ensure systems in the organisation are hardened according to best practices and that their security patches are kept up to date\n  * Analyse and measure the risk when using external third parties\n  * Maintain an information security risk register and assist with internal and external audits relating to information security\n  * Give advice and guidance to staff on issues such as spam and unwanted or malicious emails\n\n## What Do I Need to Learn to Become a Cyber Security Analyst?\n\nAt some point we\u2019ve got to ditch the theory and get our hands dirty, right?\n\nTryHackMe gives you the educational foundation to pursue a career as a SOC\nAnalyst.

Over to you, Hayden:\n\nIn my interview for the SOC Analyst position, I could answer all the technical\nquestions solely based on the knowledge I gained from TryHackMe. The\ninterviewers were impressed that although I had no industry experience, I had\nbeen exposed to a variety of tools and frameworks like the Cyber Kill Chain\nand ATT&CK. The learning path really helps understand the mindset and\nobjectives of the entire SOC, all while doing it in an entertaining way.\n\nHayden\n\nNice to see interviewers recognising the extensive knowledge to be gained on\nthe TryHackMe platform!\n\n## Things to Consider When Exploring Cyber Security Analyst Jobs\n\nNow you\u2019ve got the skills and you know the demands of the role, it\u2019s time to\nsee what\u2019s out there.\n\nWhile you can dive right into a job board and start looking for cyber security\nanalyst roles, there are a few things to consider first.\n\nFlexibility\n\nA typical Security Operations Centre runs on a 24/7 basis, so it is really\nimportant to consider the working hours offered by the company. Sometimes,\ncompanies hire people in different regions with different time zones to cover\nthe scheduling efficiently. However, some companies hire people and offer them\nto work on graveyard shifts - it\u2019s important to know what\u2019s expected of you\nbefore you get too invested in the role.\n\nRotations\n\nSimilarly, it\u2019s important to understand the shifting schedule and how team\nrotation works. Are you expected to change your weekday availability every\nmonth? Every week? You might have a lot of flexibility to accommodate these\ndemands, but sometimes you don\u2019t. Knowing this in advance allows you to\nprioritise roles where the schedule works for you.\n\nResearch\n\nWhere possible, do some research on the current state of your potential\ncompany\u2019s SOC. What\u2019s the tech stack (SIEM, EDR, SOAR)? What is the state of\nSOC visibility? It\u2019s frustrating to work on a SOC that doesn\u2019t provide enough\nvisibility to complete an investigation because this leads to ineffective\ndetections and analysis.\n\nBurnout\n\nYou might have encountered many YouTube videos discussing burnout in cyber\nsecurity. Don\u2019t take this lightly. You might be able to research the attrition\nrate of an organisation, specifically within the security team. This is a\nreflection of how well the company accommodates employees under heavy\nworkloads, which may be the case as a SOC Analyst.\n\n## How To Prepare for a Cyber Security Analyst Interview\n\nOkay, you\u2019re in contact with some interested potential employers... One of\nthem reaches out for an interview!\n\nYou\u2019re never going to know for sure what questions may come up in an interview\n- the dreaded \u201cwhere do you see yourself in ten years\u201d comes to mind. However,\nwith a little preparation you can tackle anything your interviewer throws at\nyou.\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken to tons of cyber security analysts and a lot of the same\nquestions tend to come up. We\u2019ll cover them - and their solutions - here:\n\n### Common Technical Questions at the SOC Analyst Interview\n\n## Get the Job!\n\nGet the Job! With all this preparation behind you, you\u2019re in the best possible\nplace to secure an offer and make a start in cyber security. Cyber security\nanalysts play a pivotal role in a company\u2019s security strategy, so you\u2019ll get\ntons of job satisfaction - not to mention a very competitive salary!\n\nAfter the contract is signed, you can relax and enjoy yourself before your\nofficial date. If you feel like you need to do a little extra prep, the\nsection below explores a day in the life of a SOC Analyst.\n\nShake off the first day nerves by immersing yourself in your new career.\n\n## Get Started: Tips from Cyber Security Analysts\n\nWe asked some SOC Analysts to share highlights from their role.\n\nIn the eyes of management, a SOC is there to minimise risk. Therefore, the\nmost successful cyber security analyst is going to be one who understands what\nposes a risk to the organisation, and responds to minimise that risk as\nquickly as possible. The more a SOC aligns with this goal, the better the life\nfor the analysts and for management. To reach this goal, fine-tuned logs and\ngood visibility are very important.\n\nUmair\n\n### SOC Level 1 Learning Path\n\nStart your journey towards becoming a SOC Analyst with TryHackMe today\n\n### SOC Level 1 Learning Path\n\nThis path will introduce a wide array of tools and real-life analysis\nscenarios, enabling you to get your first job as a Junior Security Analyst.\n\n## Looking for something else...?\n\nCareers \u2022 8 min read\n\n## The Ultimate Guide to a Level 1 SOC Analyst Interview\n\nDiscover our expert tips and advice for preparing for a SOC Analyst interview!\n\nCareers \u2022 3 min read\n\n## A Day in the Life of a SOC Analyst\n\nDiscover what you can expect in a SOC Analyst role from Isaiah, who previously\nworked as an in-house SOC Analyst.\n\nCareers \u2022 5 min read\n\n## How to Become a Level 1 SOC Analyst\n\nBecome a Level 1 SOC Analyst with the help of our guided SOC Level 1 Pathway.\n\n### Learning\n\n  * Hands-on labs\n  * For Business\n  * For Education\n  * Competitive Hacking\n\n### Resources\n\n  * About Us\n  * Newsroom\n  * Blog\n  * Glossary\n  * Careers\n\n### Shop\n\n  * Buy Vouchers\n  * Swag Shop\n\n### Get in touch\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * Forum\n\nWe're a gamified, hands-on cyber security training platform that you can\naccess through your browser.\n\n128 City Road, London, United Kingdom, EC1V 2NX\n\nCopyright TryHackMe 2018-2024\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAcceptable Use PolicyCookie Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
