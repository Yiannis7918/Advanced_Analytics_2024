Her widely\npraised 1951 bestseller The Sea Around Us won her a U.S. National Book\nAward,^[2]^[3] recognition as a gifted writer and financial security. Her next\nbook, The Edge of the Sea , and the post-war reissued version of her first\nbook, Under the Sea Wind, were also bestsellers. This sea trilogy explores the\nwhole of ocean life from the shores to the depths.\n\nLate in the 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially\nsome problems she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was\nthe book Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an\nunprecedented share of the American people. Although Silent Spring was met\nwith fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in\nnational pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on DDT and other\npesticides. It also inspired a grassroots environmental movement that led to\nthe creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.^[4] Carson was\nposthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Jimmy\nCarter.\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\nCarson's childhood home, the Rachel Carson Homestead, in Springdale,\nPennsylvania, in November 2009\n\nCarson was born on May 27, 1907, on a family farm near Springdale,\nPennsylvania, located by the Allegheny River near Pittsburgh. She was the\ndaughter of Maria Frazier (McLean) and Robert Warden Carson, an insurance\nsalesman.^[5] She spent a lot of time exploring around her family's 65-acre\n(26 ha) farm. An avid reader, she began writing stories, often involving\nanimals, at age eight. At age ten, she had her first story published. She\nenjoyed reading St. Nicholas Magazine, which carried her first published\nstories, the works of Beatrix Potter, the novels of Gene Stratton-Porter, and\nin her teen years, Herman Melville, Joseph Conrad, and Robert Louis Stevenson.\nThe natural world, particularly the ocean, was the common thread of her\nfavorite literature. Carson attended Springdale's small school through tenth\ngrade, and then completed high school in nearby Parnassus, Pennsylvania,\ngraduating in 1925 at the top of her class of 44 students.^[6] In high school,\nCarson was somewhat of a loner.\n\nCarson gained admission to Pennsylvania College for Women, now Chatham\nUniversity, in Pittsburgh, where she originally studied English but switched\nher major to biology in January 1928. She continued contributing to the\nschool's student newspaper and literary supplement.^[7]\n\nShe was admitted to graduate school at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore\nin 1928, but was forced to remain at the Pennsylvania College for Women for\nher senior year due to financial difficulties; she graduated magna cum laude\nin 1929. After a summer course at the Marine Biological Laboratory, she\ncontinued her studies in zoology and genetics at Johns Hopkins in the fall of\n1929.^[8] After her first year of graduate school, Carson became a part-time\nstudent, taking an assistantship in Raymond Pearl's laboratory, where she\nworked with rats and Drosophila, to earn money for tuition. After false starts\nwith pit vipers and squirrels, she completed a dissertation on the embryonic\ndevelopment of the pronephros in fish.\n\nIn June 1932, she earned a master's degree in zoology. She had intended to\ncontinue for a doctorate, however in 1934 Carson was forced to leave Johns\nHopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family\nduring the Great Depression.^[9] In 1935, Carson's father died suddenly,\nworsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to\ncare for her aging mother.\n\n## Career[edit]\n\nCarson and Bob Hines researching off the East Coast in 1952\n\nRachel Carson as told by EPA administrator Gina McCarthy\n\nDuration: 57 seconds.0:57\n\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\n\nAt the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, Carson\nsecured a temporary position with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, where she\nwrote radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts called Romance\nUnder the Waters. The series of 52 seven-minute programs focused on aquatic\nlife and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and the\nbureau's work, a task the several writers before Carson had not managed.\nCarson also began submitting articles on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay,\nbased on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.^[10]\n\nCarson's supervisor, pleased with the success of the radio series, asked her\nto write the introduction to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau; he\nalso worked to secure her the first full-time position that became available.\nSitting for the civil service exam, she outscored all other applicants and, in\n1936, became the second woman hired by the Bureau of Fisheries for a full-time\nprofessional position, as a junior aquatic biologist.^[11]\n\nUsing her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting\npoints, she wrote a steady stream of articles for The Baltimore Sun and other\nnewspapers. However, her family responsibilities further increased in January\n1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for\nher mother and two nieces.^[12]\n\nIn July 1937, the Atlantic Monthly accepted a revised version of an essay, The\nWorld of Waters, that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau\nbrochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay,\npublished as Undersea, was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean\nfloor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing\nhouse Simon & Schuster, impressed by Undersea, contacted Carson and suggested\nthat she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in Under the\nSea Wind (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the\nmeantime, Carson's article-writing success continued with her features\nappearing in Sun Magazine, Nature, and Collier's.^[13] Carson attempted to\nleave the Bureau (by then transformed into the United States Fish and Wildlife\nService) in 1945. However, few jobs for naturalists were available, since most\nmoney for science was focused on technical fields in the wake of the Manhattan\nProject.\n\nIn mid-1945, Carson first encountered the subject of DDT, a revolutionary new\npesticide\u2014lauded as the \"insect bomb\" after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima\nand Nagasaki\u2014that was only beginning to undergo tests for safety and\necological effects. DDT was one of Carson's many writing interests at the\ntime, but editors found the subject unappealing; she published nothing on DDT\nuntil 1962.^[14]\n\nCarson rose within the Fish and Wildlife Service, and in 1945 was supervising\na small writing staff. In 1949, she was appointed chief editor of\npublications, which allowed her increased opportunities for fieldwork and\nfreedom in choosing her writing projects; however, it also entailed\nincreasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson was\nworking on material for a second book and decided to begin a transition to\nwriting full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, Marie Rodell; they\nformed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's\ncareer.^[15]\n\nOxford University Press expressed interest in Carson's book proposal for a\nlife history of the ocean, spurring her to complete by early 1950 the\nmanuscript of what would become The Sea Around Us.^[16] Chapters appeared in\nScience Digest and The Yale Review, which published a chapter, \"The Birth of\nan Island,\" which won the American Association for the Advancement of\nScience's George Westinghouse Science Writing Prize. Beginning in June 1951,\nnine chapters were serialized in The New Yorker.\n\nOn July 2, 1951, the book was published by Oxford University Press. The Sea\nAround Us remained on The New York Times Bestseller List for 86 weeks, was\nabridged by Reader's Digest, won the 1952 National Book Award for\nNonfiction^[2] and the John Burroughs Medal, and resulted in Carson being\nawarded two honorary doctorates. She licensed a documentary film based on it,\nThe Sea, whose success led to republication of Under the Sea Wind, which\nbecame a bestseller. With success, came financial security; in 1952, Carson\nwas able to give up her job in order to concentrate on writing full-time.^[17]\n\nCarson was inundated with requests for speaking engagements, fan mail and\nother correspondence regarding The Sea Around Us, along with work on the\nscript that she had secured the right to review.^[18] She was very unhappy\nwith the final version of the script by writer, director, and producer Irwin\nAllen; she found it untrue to the atmosphere of the book and scientifically\nembarrassing, describing it as \"a cross between a believe-it-or-not and a\nbreezy travelogue.\"^[19] However, she discovered that her right to review the\nscript did not extend to any control over its content. This led to many\nscientific inconsistencies inside the film. Despite Carson's requests to\nresolve these problems, Allen went forward with the script. He succeeded in\nproducing a very successful documentary. It went on to win the 1953 Academy\nAward for Best Documentary Feature. However, Carson was so embittered by the\nexperience that she never again sold film rights to her work.^[20]\n\n### Relationship with Dorothy Freeman[edit]\n\nCarson met Dorothy M. Freeman in the summer of 1953 on Southport Island,\nMaine. Freeman had written to Carson welcoming her to the area when she had\nheard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It was the beginning\nof a devoted friendship that lasted the rest of Carson's life. Their\nrelationship was conducted mainly through letters and during summers spent\ntogether in Maine. Over 12 years, they exchanged around 900 letters. Many of\nthese were published in the book Always, Rachel, published in 1995 by Beacon\nPress.\n\nCarson's biographer, Linda J. Lear, writes that \"Carson sorely needed a\ndevoted friend and kindred spirit who would listen to her without advising and\naccept her wholly, the writer as well as the woman.\"^[21] She found this in\nFreeman. The two women had common interests, nature chief among them, and\nbegan exchanging letters regularly while apart. They shared summers for the\nremainder of Carson's life and met whenever else their schedules\npermitted.^[22]\n\nConcerning the depth of their relationship, commentators have said: \"the\nexpression of their love was limited almost wholly to letters and very\noccasional farewell kisses or holding of hands\".^[23] Freeman shared parts of\nCarson's letters with her husband to help him understand the relationship, but\nmuch of their correspondence was carefully guarded.^[24] Some believe Freeman\nand Carson's relationship was romantic in nature.^[25]^[26] One of the letters\nfrom Carson to Freeman reads: \"But, oh darling, I want to be with you so\nterribly that it hurts!\", while in another, Freeman writes: \"I love you beyond\nexpression... My love is boundless as the Sea.\"^[27] Carson's last letter to\nFreeman before her death ends with: \"Never forget, dear one, how deeply I have\nloved you all these years.\"^[28]\n\nShortly before Carson's death, she and Freeman destroyed hundreds of letters.\nThe surviving correspondence was published in 1995 as Always, Rachel: The\nLetters of Rachel Carson and Dorothy Freeman, 1952\u20131964: An Intimate Portrait\nof a Remarkable Friendship, edited by Martha Freeman, Dorothy's granddaughter,\nwho wrote at publication: \"A few comments in early letters indicate that\nRachel and Dorothy were initially cautious about the romantic tone and\nterminology of their correspondence. I believe this caution prompted their\ndestruction of some letters within the first two years of their\nfriendship...\"^[29] According to one reviewer, the pair \"fit Carolyn\nHeilbrun's characterization of a strong female friendship, where what matters\nis 'not whether friends are homosexual or heterosexual, lovers or not, but\nwhether they share the wonderful energy of work in the public sphere.'\"^[30]\n\nAccording to her biographer, Linda Lear, there was a disagreement about the\nfinal arrangements for Rachel. Her brother, Robert Carson, insisted that her\ncremated remains be buried beside their mother in Maryland. This was against\nher wishes to be buried in Maine. In the end, a compromise was reached.\nCarson's wishes were carried out by an organizing committee, including her\nagent (Marie Rodell), her editor (Paul Brooks), and Dorothy Freeman. In the\nspring of 1964, Dorothy received half of Rachel's ashes in the mail sent to\nher by Robert Carson. In the summer of that year, Dorothy carried out Rachel's\nfinal wishes, scattering her ashes along the rocky shores of Sheepscot Bay in\nMaine.^[31]\n\n### The Edge of the Sea and transition to conservation work[edit]\n\nEarly in 1953, Carson began library and field research on the ecology and\norganisms of the Atlantic shore.^[32] In 1955, she completed the third volume\nof her sea trilogy, The Edge of the Sea, which focuses on life in coastal\necosystems, particularly along the Eastern Seaboard. It appeared in The New\nYorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book\nrelease by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's\nreputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; The Edge of the\nSea received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for The\nSea Around Us.^[33]\n\nThrough 1955 and 1956, Carson worked on several projects\u2014including the script\nfor an Omnibus episode, \"Something About the Sky\"\u2014and wrote articles for\npopular magazines. Her plan for the next book was to address evolution.\nHowever, the publication of Julian Huxley's Evolution in Action\u2014and her own\ndifficulty in finding a clear and compelling approach to the topic\u2014led her to\nabandon the project. Instead, her interests were turning to conservation. She\nconsidered an environment-themed book project tentatively titled Remembrance\nof the Earth and became involved with The Nature Conservancy and other\nconservation groups. She also made plans to buy and preserve from development\nan area in Maine she and Freeman called the \"Lost Woods.\"^[34]\n\nIn early 1957, a family tragedy struck for the third time when one of her\nnieces she had cared for since the 1940s died at the age of 31, leaving her\n5-year-old son, Roger Christie, an orphan. Carson took on the responsibility\nfor Roger when she adopted him, along with caring for her aging mother. Carson\nmoved to Silver Spring, Maryland to care for Roger and spent much of 1957\nputting together a new living situation and studying specific environmental\nthreats.\n\nBy late 1957, Carson was closely following federal proposals for widespread\npesticide spraying; the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) planned\nto eradicate fire ants. Other spraying programs involving chlorinated\nhydrocarbons and organophosphates were on the rise.^[35] For the rest of her\nlife, Carson's main professional focus would be the dangers of pesticide\noveruse.\n\n### Silent Spring[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Spring\n\nSee also: DDT\n\nSilent Spring, Carson's most influential book, was published by Houghton\nMifflin on September 27, 1962.^[36] The book described the harmful effects of\npesticides on the environment, and is widely credited with helping launch the\nenvironmental movement.^[37] Carson was not the first or the only person to\nraise concern about DDT,^[38] but her combination of \"scientific knowledge and\npoetic writing\" reached a broad audience and helped to focus opposition to DDT\nuse.^[39] In 1994, an edition of Silent Spring was published with an\nintroduction written by Vice President Al Gore.^[40]^[41] In 2012 Silent\nSpring was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American\nChemical Society for its role in the development of the modern environmental\nmovement.^[42]\n\n#### Research and writing[edit]\n\nStarting in the mid-1940s, Carson had become concerned about the use of\nsynthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military\nfunding of science since World War II. However, the United States federal\ngovernment's 1957 gypsy moth, now called spongy moth, eradication program\nprompted Carson to devote her research and her next book to pesticides and\nenvironmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT\nand other pesticides mixed with fuel oil, including the spraying of private\nland. Landowners on Long Island filed a lawsuit to have the spraying stopped,\nand many in affected regions followed the case closely.^[4] Though the suit\nwas lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions\nagainst potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for\nlater successful environmental actions.^[4]^[43]^[44]\n\nThe Audubon Naturalist Society also actively opposed such spraying programs\nand recruited Carson to help make public the government's exact spraying\npractices and the related research.^[45] Carson began the four-year project of\nwhat would become Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage\nattributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause, such\nas essayist E. B. White and several journalists and scientists. By 1958,\nCarson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science\njournalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and\nwell-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more\nthan simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon, it was a solo\nproject. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of Silent\nSpring).^[46]\n\nAs her research progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who\nwere documenting the physiological and environmental effects of\npesticides.^[4] She also took advantage of her connections with many\ngovernment scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From\nreading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found\ntwo scientific camps when it came to pesticides: those who dismissed the\npossible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who\nwere open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative\nmethods such as biological pest control.^[47]\n\nShe also found significant support and extensive evidence from a group of\nbiodynamic agriculture organic market gardeners, their adviser, Dr. Ehrenfried\nPfeiffer, other contacts, and their suite of legal actions (1957\u20131960) against\nthe U.S. Government. According to recent research by Paull (2013), this may\nhave been the primary and (for strategic reasons) uncredited source for\nCarson's book. Marjorie Spock and Mary T. Richards of Long Island, New York,\ncontested the aerial spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). They\ncompiled their evidence and shared it with Carson, who used it, their\nextensive contacts, and the trial transcripts as a primary input for Silent\nSpring. Carson wrote of the content as \"a gold mine of information\" and says,\n\"I feel guilty about the mass of your material I have here\"^[48] and makes\nmultiple references to Pfeiffer and his correspondence.^[49]^[50]\n\nBy 1959, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service responded to the criticism\nby Carson and others with a public service film, Fire Ant on Trial; Carson\ncharacterized it as \"flagrant propaganda\" that ignored the dangers that\nspraying pesticides (especially dieldrin and heptachlor) posed to humans and\nwildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in The Washington\nPost, that attributed the recent decline in bird populations\u2014in her words, the\n\"silencing of birds\"\u2014to pesticide overuse.^[51] That was also the year of the\n\"Great Cranberry Scandal\": the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. cranberries\nwere found to contain high levels of the herbicide aminotriazole (which caused\ncancer in laboratory rats), and the sale of all cranberry products was halted.\nCarson attended the subsequent FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations;\nshe came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry\nrepresentatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted\nby the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying. She also\nwondered about the possible \"financial inducements behind certain pesticide\nprograms.\"^[52]\n\nResearch at the Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health\nbrought Carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut\nof cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance was the work of\nNational Cancer Institute researcher and environmental cancer section founding\ndirector Wilhelm Hueper, who classified many pesticides as carcinogens. Carson\nand her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian\nDorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to\nCarson, the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides\nwas clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the\nsmall community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis.^[53]\n\nBy 1960, Carson had more than enough research material, and the writing was\nprogressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had\ninvestigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the\nhuman sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a\nduodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks,\ngreatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full\nrecovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer\nchapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which\nnecessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as\nprecautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December, Carson\ndiscovered that the tumor was malignant and the cancer had metastasized.^[54]\nHer research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea\nAround Us and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann.^[55] Most of\nthe research and writing was done by the fall of 1960, except for the\ndiscussion of recent research on biological pest controls and investigations\nof a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the\nfinal revisions in 1961 and early 1962.^[56] While writing the book, Carson\nchose to hide her illness so that the pesticide companies could not use it\nagainst her (she worried that if the companies knew, they would use it as\nammunition to make her book look untrustworthy and biased).^[57]\n\nFinding a title for the book proved difficult; \"Silent Spring\" was initially\nsuggested as a title for the chapter on birds. By August 1961, Carson finally\nagreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: Silent Spring\nwould be a metaphorical title for the entire book, suggesting a bleak future\nfor the whole natural world, rather than a single chapter title about the\nliteral absence of birdsong.^[58] With Carson's approval, editor Paul Brooks\nat Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who\nalso designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, A Fable for\nTomorrow, which Carson intended as a gentle introduction to what might\notherwise be a forbiddingly serious topic. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had\nessentially finished the editing and were laying the groundwork for promoting\nthe book by sending the manuscript out to select individuals for final\nsuggestions.^[59]\n\n#### Content[edit]\n\nBiographer Mark Hamilton Lytle writes that Carson \"quite self-consciously\ndecided to write a book calling into question the paradigm of scientific\nprogress that defined post-war American culture.\" The overriding theme of\nSilent Spring is the powerful\u2014and often adverse\u2014effect humans have on the\nnatural world.^[60]\n\nCarson's main argument is that pesticides have detrimental effects on the\nenvironment; they are more properly termed biocides, she argues, because their\neffects are rarely limited to the target pests. DDT is a prime example, but\nother synthetic pesticides come under scrutiny, many of which are subject to\nbioaccumulation. Carson also accuses the chemical industry of intentionally\nspreading disinformation and public officials of accepting industry claims\nuncritically. Most of the book is devoted to pesticides' effects on natural\necosystems. However, four chapters also detail cases of human pesticide\npoisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides.^[61]\nRegarding DDT and cancer, the subject of so much subsequent debate, Carson\nonly briefly mentions the topic:\n\n> In laboratory tests on animal subjects, DDT has produced suspicious liver\n> tumors. Scientists of the Food and Drug Administration who reported the\n> discovery of these tumors were uncertain how to classify them but felt there\n> was some \"justification for considering them low grade hepatic cell\n> carcinomas.\" Dr. Hueper [author of Occupational Tumors and Allied Diseases]\n> now gives DDT the definite rating of a \"chemical carcinogen.\"^[62]\n\nCarson predicted increased consequences in the future, especially as targeted\npests develop pesticide resistance. At the same time, weakened ecosystems fall\nprey to unanticipated invasive species. The book closes with a call for a\nbiotic approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides.^[63]\n\nRegarding DDT, Carson never called for an outright ban. Part of the argument\nshe made in Silent Spring was that even if DDT and other insecticides had no\nenvironmental side effects, their indiscriminate overuse was counter-\nproductive because it would create insect resistance, making them useless in\neliminating the target insect populations:\n\n> No responsible person contends that insect-borne disease should be ignored.\n> The question that has now urgently presented itself is whether it is either\n> wise or responsible to attack the problem by methods that are rapidly making\n> it worse. The world has heard much of the triumphant war against disease by\n> controlling insect vectors of infection. However, it has heard little of the\n> other side of the story\u2014the defeats, the short-lived triumphs that now\n> strongly support the alarming view that the insect enemy has been made\n> actually stronger by our efforts. Even worse, we may have destroyed our very\n> means of fighting.^[64]\n\nCarson further noted that \"Malaria programmes are threatened by resistance\namong mosquitoes\"^[65] and emphasized the advice given by the director of\nHolland's Plant Protection Service: \"Practical advice should be 'Spray as\nlittle as you possibly can' rather than 'Spray to the limit of your capacity'\n... Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as\npossible.\"^[66]\n\n#### Promotion and reception[edit]\n\nCarson and the others involved with the publication of Silent Spring expected\nfierce criticism. They were particularly concerned about the possibility of\nbeing sued for libel. Carson was also undergoing radiation therapy to combat\nher spreading cancer and expected to have little energy to devote to defending\nher work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated\nattacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters\nas possible before the book's release.^[67]\n\nMost of the book's scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with\nrelevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended\nthe White House Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin\ndistributed proof copies of Silent Spring to many of the delegates and\npromoted the upcoming New Yorker serialization. Among many others, Carson also\nsent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas, a\nlongtime environmental advocate who had argued against the court's rejection\nof the Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided Carson with\nsome of the material included in her chapter on herbicides).^[68]\n\nThough Silent Spring had generated a relatively high level of interest based\non pre-publication promotion, this became much more intense with the\nserialization in The New Yorker, which began on June 16, 1962, issue. This\nbrought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists\nand a wide swath of the American populace. Around that time, Carson also\nlearned that Silent Spring had been selected as the Book of the Month for\nOctober; as she put it, this would \"carry it to farms and hamlets all over\nthat country that don't know what a bookstore looks like\u2014much less The New\nYorker.\"^[69] Other publicity included a positive editorial in The New York\nTimes and excerpts of the serialized version in Audubon magazine, with another\nround of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The\nstory of the birth defect-causing drug thalidomide broke just before the\nbook's publication as well, inviting comparisons between Carson and Frances\nOldham Kelsey, the Food and Drug Administration reviewer who had blocked the\ndrug's sale in the United States.^[70]\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was\nstrong opposition to Silent Spring from the chemical industry. DuPont (a main\nmanufacturer of DDT and 2,4-D) and Velsicol Chemical Corporation (exclusive\nmanufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor) were among the first to respond.\nDuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated\nimpact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton\nMifflin and The New Yorker and Audubon unless the planned Silent Spring\nfeatures were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also\nlodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical\ncompanies and associated organizations produced a number of their own\nbrochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However,\nCarson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process\nSilent Spring had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as\nplanned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a\npamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).^[71]\n\nAmerican Cyanamid biochemist Robert White-Stevens and former Cyanamid chemist\nThomas Jukes were among the most aggressive critics, especially of Carson's\nanalysis of DDT.^[72] According to White-Stevens, \"If man were to follow the\nteachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects\nand diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth.\"^[73] Others went\nfurther, attacking Carson's scientific credentials (because her training was\nin marine biology rather than biochemistry) and her character. White-Stevens\nlabeled her \"...a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature,\"^[74]\nwhile former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson, in a letter to\nformer President Dwight D. Eisenhower, reportedly concluded that because she\nwas unmarried despite being physically attractive, she was \"probably a\nCommunist.\"^[75]\n\nMany critics repeatedly asserted that she was calling for the elimination of\nall pesticides. However, Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the\nbanning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides but was instead\nencouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the\nchemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem.^[76] In fact, she concludes her\nsection on DDT in Silent Spring not by urging a total ban but with advice for\nspraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.^[66]\n\nThe academic community, including prominent defenders such as H. J. Muller,\nLoren Eiseley, Clarence Cottam, and Frank Egler, by and large, backed the\nbook's scientific claims; public opinion soon turned Carson's way as well. The\nchemical industry campaign backfired, as the controversy greatly increased\npublic awareness of potential pesticide dangers, as well as Silent Spring book\nsales. Pesticide use became a major public issue, especially after the CBS\nReports TV special The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson that aired April 3,\n1963. The program included segments of Carson reading from Silent Spring and\ninterviews with several other experts, mostly critics (including White-\nStevens); according to biographer Linda Lear, \"in juxtaposition to the wild-\neyed, loud-voiced Dr. Robert White-Stevens in white lab coat, Carson appeared\nanything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended.\"^[77]\nReactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were\noverwhelmingly positive, and the program spurred a congressional review of\npesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the\nPresident's Science Advisory Committee.^[78] Within a year or so of\npublication, the attacks on the book and Carson had largely lost\nmomentum.^[79]^[80]\n\nIn one of her last public appearances, Carson testified before President John\nF. Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee. The committee issued its report on\nMay 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's scientific claims.^[81] Following the\nreport's release, she also testified before a United States Senate\nsubcommittee to make policy recommendations. Though Carson received hundreds\nof other speaking invitations, she could not accept the great majority of\nthem. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation\ntherapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was\nphysically able, however, including a notable appearance on The Today Show and\nspeeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a\nflurry of awards and honors: the Audubon Medal (from the National Audubon\nSociety), the Cullum Geographical Medal (from the American Geographical\nSociety), and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.^[82]\n\n## Death[edit]\n\nWeakened from breast cancer and her treatment regimen, Carson became ill with\na respiratory virus in January 1964. Her condition worsened, and in February,\ndoctors found that she had severe anemia from her radiation treatments. In\nMarch, they discovered that the cancer had reached her liver. She died of a\nheart attack on April 14, 1964, in her home in Silver Spring,\nMaryland.^[1]^[83]^[84]\n\nHer body was cremated, and some of her ashes were buried beside her mother at\nParklawn Memorial Gardens in Rockville, Maryland.^[85] The rest were scattered\nalong the coast of Squirrel Island near Sheepscot River in Maine.\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\nStatue of Carson at the Museo Rocsen in Nono, C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina\n\n### Collected papers and posthumous publications[edit]\n\nCarson bequeathed her manuscripts and papers to Yale University to take\nadvantage of the new state-of-the-art preservations facilities of the Beinecke\nRare Book & Manuscript Library. Her longtime agent and literary executor Marie\nRodell spent nearly two years organizing and cataloging Carson's papers and\ncorrespondence, distributing all the letters to their senders so that only\nwhat each correspondent approved would be submitted to the archive.^[86]\n\nIn 1965, Rodell arranged for the publication of an essay Carson had intended\nto expand into a book: The Sense of Wonder. The essay, which was combined with\nphotographs by Charles Pratt and others, exhorts parents to help their\nchildren experience the \"...lasting pleasures of contact with the natural\nworld ... available to anyone who will place himself under the influence of\nearth, sea, and sky and their amazing life.\"^[87]\n\nIn addition to the letters in Always Rachel, in 1998, a volume of Carson's\npreviously unpublished work was published as Lost Woods: The Discovered\nWriting of Rachel Carson, edited by Linda Lear. All of Carson's books remain\nin print.^[87]\n\n### Grassroots environmentalism and the EPA[edit]\n\nCarson's work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement. Silent\nSpring, in particular, was a rallying point for the fledgling social movement\nin the 1960s. According to environmental engineer and Carson scholar H.\nPatricia Hynes, \"Silent Spring altered the balance of power in the world. No\none since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of\nprogress so easily or uncritically.\"^[88] Carson's work, and the activism it\ninspired, are at least partly responsible for the deep ecology movement and\nthe overall strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s.\nIt was also influential on the rise of ecofeminism and on many feminist\nscientists.^[89]\n\nWhile there remains no evidence that Carson was openly a women's rights\nactivist, her work and its subsequent criticisms have left an iconic legacy\nfor the ecofeminist movement.^[9] Attacks on Carson's credibility included\ncriticism of her credentials in which she was labeled an \"amateur.\" It was\nsaid that her writing was too \"emotional.\"^[9] Ecofeminist scholars argue that\nnot only was the dissenting rhetoric gendered to paint Carson as hysterical\nbut was done because her arguments challenged the capitalist production of\nlarge agri-business corporations.^[9] Others, such as Yaakov Garb, suggest\nthat in addition to not being a women's rights activist, Carson also had no\nanti-capitalist agenda and that such attacks were unwarranted.^[9]\nAdditionally, the way photos of Carson were used to portray her are often\nquestioned because of few representations of her engaging in work typical of a\nscientist, but instead of her leisure activities.^[9]\n\nCarson's most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to\nban DDT in the United States (and related efforts to ban or limit its use\nthroughout the world). Though environmental concerns about DDT had been\nconsidered by government agencies as early as Carson's testimony before the\nPresident's Science Advisory Committee, the 1967 formation of the\nEnvironmental Defense Fund was the first significant milestone in the campaign\nagainst DDT. The organization brought lawsuits against the government to\n\"establish a citizen's right to a clean environment,\" and the arguments\nemployed against DDT largely mirrored Carson's. By 1972, the Environmental\nDefense Fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phase-out\nof DDT use in the United States (except in emergency cases).^[90]\n\nThe creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by the Nixon\nAdministration in 1970 addressed another concern that Carson had brought to\nlight. Until then, the same agency (the USDA) was responsible both for\nregulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry;\nCarson saw this as a conflict of interest since the agency was not responsible\nfor effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy.\nFifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as \"the\nextended shadow of Silent Spring.\" Much of the agency's early work, such as\nenforcing the 1972 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, was\ndirectly related to Carson's work.^[91]\n\nIn the 1980s, the policies of the Reagan Administration emphasized economic\ngrowth, rolling back many of the environmental policies adopted in response to\nCarson and her work.^[92]\n\n### Posthumous honors[edit]\n\nThe Rachel Carson Bridge in Pittsburgh in 1999The statue of Rachel Carson in\nWoods Hole in May 2016\n\nVarious groups ranging from government institutions to environmental and\nconservation organizations to scholarly societies have celebrated Carson's\nlife and work since her death. Perhaps most significantly, on June 9, 1980,\nCarson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian\nhonor in the United States. A 17\u00a2 Great Americans series postage stamp was\nissued in her honor the following year; several other countries have since\nissued Carson postage as well.^[93] In 1973, Carson was inducted into the\nNational Women's Hall of Fame.^[94]\n\nThe University of California, Santa Cruz, named one of its colleges, formerly\nknown as College Eight, Rachel Carson College in 2016.^[95] Rachel Carson\nCollege is the first college at the university to bear a woman's name.\n\nMunich's Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society was founded in 2009.\nAn international, interdisciplinary center for research and education in the\nenvironmental humanities and social sciences, it was established as a joint\ninitiative of Munich's Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t and the Deutsches\nMuseum, with the support of the German Federal Ministry of Education and\nResearch.\n\nCarson's birthplace and childhood home in Springdale, Pennsylvania, now known\nas the Rachel Carson Homestead, became a National Register of Historic Places\nsite and the nonprofit Rachel Carson Homestead Association was created in 1975\nto manage it.^[96] Her home in Colesville, Maryland, where she wrote Silent\nSpring, was named a National Historic Landmark in 1991.^[97] Near Pittsburgh,\na 35.7 miles (57 km) hiking trail, the Rachel Carson Trail and maintained by\nthe Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy, was dedicated to Carson in 1975.^[98] A\nPittsburgh bridge was renamed in Carson's honor as the Rachel Carson\nBridge.^[99] The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection State\nOffice Building in Harrisburg is named in her honor.\n\nElementary schools in Gaithersburg, Maryland,^[100] Sammamish,\nWashington^[101] and San Jose, California^[102] middle schools in Beaverton,\nOregon^[103] Queens, New York City, Rachel Carson Intermediate School, in\nHerndon, Virginia,^[104] Rachel Carson Middle School, and a high school in\nBrooklyn, New York City were all named in her honor.^[105]\n\nTwo research vessels have sailed in the United States bearing the name R/V\nRachel Carson. One is on the west coast, owned by Monterey Bay Aquarium\nResearch Institute (MBARI),^[106] and the other is on the east coast, operated\nby the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. Another vessel\nof the name, now scrapped, was a former naval vessel obtained and converted by\nthe United States EPA. It operated on the Great Lakes. The Florida Keys\nNational Marine Sanctuary also operates a mooring buoy maintenance vessel\nnamed the Rachel Carson.^[107]\n\nThe ceremonial auditorium on the third floor of EPA headquarters, the William\nJefferson Clinton Federal Building, is named after Carson. The Rachel Carson\nRoom is close to the EPA Administrator's office. It has been the site of\nnumerous important announcements, including the Clean Air Interstate\nRule.^[108]\n\nA number of conservation areas have been named for Carson as well. Between\n1964 and 1990, 650 acres (263 ha) near Brookeville in Montgomery County,\nMaryland were acquired and set aside as the Rachel Carson Conservation Park,\nadministered by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning\nCommission.^[109] In 1969, the Coastal Maine National Wildlife Refuge became\nthe Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge; expansions will bring the size of\nthe refuge to about 9,125 acres (3,693 ha).^[110] In 1985, North Carolina\nrenamed one of its estuarine reserves in honor of Carson, in\nBeaufort.^[111]^[112]\n\nCarson is also a frequent namesake for prizes awarded by philanthropic,\neducational and scholarly institutions. The Rachel Carson Prize, founded in\nStavanger, Norway in 1991, is awarded to women who have made a contribution in\nthe field of environmental protection.^[113] The American Society for\nEnvironmental History has awarded the Rachel Carson Prize for Best\nDissertation since 1993.^[114] Since 1998, the Society for Social Studies of\nScience has awarded an annual Rachel Carson Book Prize for \"a book length work\nof social or political relevance in the area of science and technology\nstudies.\"^[115] The Society of Environmental Journalists gives an annual award\nand two honourable mentions for books on environmental issues in Carson's\nname, such as was awarded to Joe Roman's Listed: Dispatches from America's\nEndangered Species Act^[116] in 2012.^[117] The Sierra Club and its foundation\nrecognize donors who have provided for the club in their estate plans as the\nRachel Carson Society.^[118] The Rachel Carson Center for Environment and\nSociety at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (Germany) awards post-\ndoctoral fellowships in the area of the environment and society.^[119]\n\nThe Rachel Carson sculpture in Woods Hole, Massachusetts was unveiled on July\n14, 2013.^[120] Google created a Google Doodle for Carson's 107th birthday on\nMay 27, 2014.^[121] Carson was featured during the \"HerStory\" video tribute to\nnotable women on U2's tour in 2017 for the 30th anniversary of The Joshua Tree\nduring a performance of \"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\"^[122] from the band's\n1991 album Achtung Baby.\n\n#### Centennial events[edit]\n\nExternal videos  \n---  \nPanel discussion on Rachel Carson's centennial with Roland Clement, Annick\nSmith, Stewart Udall, and Edward O. Wilson, June 2, 2007, C-SPAN  \nThe celebration of the 100th anniversary of Carson's birth in May 2007 in\nSpringdale, Pennsylvania\n\nThe centennial of Carson's birth occurred in 2007. On Earth Day (April 22),\nCourage for the Earth: Writers, Scientists, and Activists Celebrate the Life\nand Writing of Rachel Carson released as \"a centennial appreciation of Rachel\nCarson's brave life and transformative writing.\" It included 13 essays by\nenvironmental writers and scientists.^[123]\n\nDemocratic Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland had intended to submit a\nresolution celebrating Carson for her \"legacy of scientific rigor coupled with\npoetic sensibility\" on the 100th anniversary of her birth. The resolution was\nblocked by Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.^[124]\n\nOn May 27, 2007, the Rachel Carson Homestead Association held a birthday party\nand sustainable feast at her birthplace and home in Springdale, Pennsylvania,\nand the first Rachel Carson Legacy Conference in Pittsburgh with E. O. Wilson\nas keynote speaker. Both Rachel's Sustainable Feast and the conference\ncontinue as annual events.\n\nAlso in 2007, American author Ginger Wadsworth wrote a biography of\nCarson.^[125]^[126]\n\n## List of works[edit]\n\n  * Under the Sea Wind, 1941, Simon & Schuster, Penguin Group, 1996, ISBN 0-14-025380-7\n  * \"Food From the Sea: Fish and Shellfish of New England\" (PDF).
