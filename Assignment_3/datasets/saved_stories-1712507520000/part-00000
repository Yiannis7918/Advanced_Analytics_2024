Have you noticed\nhow it\u2019s always delivered with more than a hint of smug condescension? How it\nalways seems to be a value judgment on the way you live your life?\n\nIt seems to me that the advice is almost always coming from two types of\npeople: the extroverted, or the terminally online. The extrovert wants you to\ntravel. Travel is the magic panacea to all of life\u2019s problems. The very act of\nlugging your family around from one place to another provides enlightenment\nand is the key to a higher state of being. A friend once told me that I should\ntravel more, because otherwise life \u201cpasses me by\u201d. As if the fulfillment I\nget from my many hobbies is somehow inferior to the act of...walking around\nand seeing things.\n\nWhat if I don\u2019t like to travel? What if I abhor spending hours in airports or\na car? What if seeing new places doesn\u2019t attract me in the least? What\nif\u2013gasp!\u2013I\u2019m not interested in experiencing other cultures up close? What if I\ndon\u2019t see my surroundings as something that I need to periodically escape\nfrom?\n\nThe terminally online thinks you should only own an iPhone and a Mac. Since\nthat\u2019s enough for them, because all they do is sit in front of a screen all\nday, then that should be enough for you too. Photos of empty studio apartments\nflood social media as if their owners have transcended the need for mere\npossessions, but all I see is the sterile environment of a shallow existence.\n\nScrew all that. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you the things that bring you joy are\nless valid than the ones that do the same for them. Things enable and\npredicate experiences. They become an extension of ourselves through which the\nexperiences we can...well, experience, are expanded.\n\nBe mindful of your consumption habits, and steer them in a direction that is\ngood for your soul. Buy things that you will actually use. Prioritize those\nthings that bring you real joy, as opposed to those that reinforce habits that\nare bad for you. Will the latest iPhone really bring you any more happiness\nthan the one you currently have, or will it just enable you to doomscroll even\nmore? A tablet that you can use to learn digital art might bring you more\nfulfilment. Or an e-reader might re-Kindle (see what I did there?) your love\nfor books. Better yet, go analog, go tactile. Buy a bike, a skateboard, a\nguitar, a gun. Fuck it, buy all four if you can afford it and have the time to\nuse them and the space to store them.\n\nI think a better distinction can be made on the disposability of both\nexperiences and things. Obviously this is a nebulous trait in the case of\nexperiences versus tangible objects, but I\u2019m sure you instinctively know what\nI\u2019m talking about. Some experiences are hollow, just how some things are just\ndead weight that drag us down. Standing in a queue for hours in front of some\ntourist trap is not better than buying a frisbee and heading out to the park,\njust how buying the tenth fucking Stanley cup will not bring you one iota of\njoy more than buying a theater ticket.\n\n\ud83d\udcac Have a thought on this post?
