This is the seventh state of matter.\n\n(Credit: Wolfgang Ketterle/MIT/Center for Ultracold Atoms)\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n  * Most of us, on Earth, have a familiarity with three phases of matter: solids, liquids and gases.\n  * But at higher temperatures, the atoms making up matter ionize, creating a plasma, and at really high temperatures, individual protons and neutrons break down into a quark-gluon plasma.\n  * Meanwhile, at very low temperatures, the different types of particles form either Bose-Einstein or Fermionic condensates. All told, there are 7 known states of matter, not merely three.\n\nEthan Siegel\n\nShare Beyond solid, liquid, and gas: the 7 states of matter on Facebook\n\nShare Beyond solid, liquid, and gas: the 7 states of matter on Twitter (X)\n\nShare Beyond solid, liquid, and gas: the 7 states of matter on LinkedIn\n\nHow many states of matter are there? When you were young, you probably learned\nabout the three that are most common to our experience: solid, liquid, and\ngas. All of these occur with regularity here on Earth\u2019s surface: rocks and\nices are solids, water and many oils are liquids, while the atmosphere that we\nbreathe is a gas. However, these three common states of matter are all based\non neutral atoms; restrictions that the Universe is not bound by.\n\nIf you bombard any atom with enough energy, you\u2019ll kick the electrons off of\nit, creating an ionized plasma: the fourth state of matter. Turn up the energy\nhigh enough, and even protons and neutrons will disintegrate, forming a quark-\ngluon plasma: arguably the fifth state of matter.\n\nBut there are two additional states of matter that not only can exist, but do:\nBose-Einstein Condensates and Fermionic Condensates, the sixth and seventh\nstates of matter. At present, they\u2019re only achievable under extreme laboratory\nconditions, but they might play an important role in the Universe itself.\nHere\u2019s why.\n\nIn the liquid phase, dropping the pressure significantly can result in a solid\n(ice) or a gas (water vapor), depending on what the temperature is and how\nrapidly the transition occurs. At sufficiently high temperatures, all atom-\nbased matter will become an ionized plasma: the fourth state of matter.\n\n(Credit: Matthieumarechal/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nHere on Earth, everything is made up of atoms. Some atoms bind together to\nform molecules; other atoms exist as standalone entities. Regardless of the\nnumber of atoms in any particular chemical compound \u2014 water, oxygen, methane,\nhelium, etc. \u2014 the combination of temperature and pressure conditions\ndetermines whether it\u2019s a solid, liquid, or gas.\n\nWater, most famously, freezes at low temperatures and modest pressures,\nbecomes liquid at either higher pressures and/or higher temperatures, and\nbecomes a gas at still higher temperatures or very low pressures. There\u2019s a\ncritical temperature, however, above about 374 \u00b0C (705 \u00b0F), at which this\ndistinction breaks down. At low pressures, you still get a gas; at higher\npressures, you get a supercritical fluid with properties of both gas and\nliquid. Go to higher temperatures still, and you\u2019ll begin ionizing your\nmolecules, creating a plasma: that fourth state of matter.\n\nWhen a grape is cut nearly perfectly in half, but a thin bridge of grape skin\nis left connecting them, a trip into the microwave will cause sparks to fly,\ncreating a plasma along the bridge. Plasmas are created whenever electrons are\nkicked off of the atoms and molecules they were previously bound to, and at\nhigh enough energies and temperatures, all solids, liquids, and gases will\nbecome plasmas.\n\n(Credit: New York Times video)\n\nAlthough that\u2019s where most discussions of states of matter end, it\u2019s hardly\nthe end of the scientific story. In truth, that\u2019s just the end of the atomic\npart of the story. For the rest, we need to venture into the subatomic world:\nthe world of particles smaller than the atom. We\u2019ve already met one of them:\nthe electron, which is one of the fundamental particles of the Standard Model.\n\nElectrons are the negatively charged particles in atoms that orbit the atomic\nnucleus, the same particles that get kicked off at high energies to form an\nionized plasma. The atomic nucleus, meanwhile, is made up of protons and\nneutrons, which in turn are made of three quarks apiece. Inside protons and\nneutrons, gluons, as well as quark-antiquark pairs, are constantly created,\ndestroyed, emitted and absorbed within each of these composite particles. It\u2019s\na messy subatomic world inside every proton and neutron.\n\nA proton isn\u2019t just three quarks and gluons, but a sea of dense particles and\nantiparticles inside. The more precisely we look at a proton and the greater\nthe energies that we perform deep inelastic scattering experiments at, the\nmore substructure we find inside the proton itself. There appears to be no\nlimit to the density of particles inside, but whether a proton is\nfundamentally stable or not is an unanswered question.\n\nCredit: Jim Pivarski/Fermilab/CMS Collaboration\n\nIf you increase the temperatures and energies to high enough values, even the\nprotons and neutrons themselves will dissociate into the component quarks,\ngluons, and whatever quark-antiquark pairs you can create from the available\nenergy and Einstein\u2019s mass-energy equivalence law, E = mc^2. Whereas in our\nconventional experience, quarks always bind together three-at-a-time into\nbound states generally known as baryons, at high enough energies, they become\na quark-gluon plasma: the fifth state of matter.\n\nFor approximately the first microsecond of the Universe after the start of the\nhot Big Bang, there were no protons and neutrons, but rather only a quark-\ngluon plasma, tightly coupled to all the other forms of matter, antimatter,\nand radiation that existed back then. We presently study these quark-gluon\nplasmas experimentally by colliding heavy ions \u2014 the bare atomic nuclei of\natoms that contain large numbers of protons and neutrons, like gold, lead, and\nother atoms at the far end of the periodic table \u2014 in the world\u2019s most\npowerful particle colliders.\n\nBrookhaven\u2019s RHIC (the relativistic heavy ion collider) and CERN\u2019s LHC (the\nlarge hadron collider) have helped us not only explore the subatomic worlds of\nthese particles, but how they behave as an aggregate: a full-fledged quark-\ngluon plasma.\n\nIn the earliest stages of the hot Big Bang, there were no bound structures\nthat could form, only a \u201cprimordial soup\u201d of matter particles, antimatter\nparticles, and bosons like the photon. This hot, dense, and rapidly expanding\nstate would quickly cool off.\n\nCredit: Brookhaven National Labs/RHIC\n\nBut even though these states of matter require very large numbers of\nparticles, they also require very high energies to achieve. If, instead of\ngoing to high energies, we go to specialized conditions in the other, low-\nenergy direction, we find that these particles can achieve something else\nremarkable: the creation of a sixth and seventh states of matter. There\u2019s one\nkey realization that\u2019s required to lead us there: every particle in the\nUniverse, no matter whether it\u2019s a fundamental or a composite particle, falls\ninto one of two categories.\n\n  1. Fermion. This is a particle that, when we measure its spin (or intrinsic angular momentum), we always get values that are quantized in half-integer values of Planck\u2019s constant: \u00b11/2, \u00b13/2, \u00b15/2, etc.\n  2. Boson. This is a particle that, when we measure its spin, we always get values that are quantized in integer values of Planck\u2019s constant: 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, etc.\n\nThat\u2019s it. In all the known Universe, there are no particles \u2014 fundamental or\ncomposite \u2014 that fall into any other category. Everything that we\u2019ve ever\nmeasured behaves either as a fermion or a boson.\n\nThe particles and antiparticles of the Standard Model have now all been\ndirectly detected, with the last holdout, the Higgs boson, falling at the LHC\nearlier this decade. Today, only the gluons and photons are massless;\neverything else has a non-zero rest mass.\n\nCredit: E. Siegel/Beyond the Galaxy\n\nElectrons, being fundamental particles with spins of \u00b11\u20442, are obviously\nfermions. Protons and neutrons, each of which are made up of three quarks\napiece, also have spins that can only be \u00b11\u20442, as the spin of one quark will\nalways oppose the spin of the other two. However, if you bind a proton and a\nneutron together, you create a composite particle known as a deuteron: the\natomic nucleus of a heavy isotope of hydrogen known as deuterium.\n\nA deuteron, which is a fermion bound together with another fermion, always\nbehaves as a boson. (Why? Because \u00b11\u20442 + \u00b11\u20442 can only equal -1, 0, or +1: the\nspin values for a boson.) Whether we\u2019re dealing with fundamental or composite\nparticles, fermions and bosons exhibit a key difference from one another. Yes,\ntheir spins are different, but that difference leads to an amazing\nconsequence: fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle; bosons do not.\n\nThe way that atoms link up to form molecules, including organic molecules and\nbiological processes, is only possible because of the Pauli exclusion rule\nthat governs electrons, forbidding any two of them from occupying the same\nquantum state.\n\n(Credit: NASA/Jenny Mottar)\n\nThe Pauli Exclusion Principle is one of the key cornerstones that was\ndiscovered in the early days of quantum mechanics. It states that no two\nfermions can occupy the exact same quantum state as one another.\n\nThis comes into play when we start putting electrons onto a fully ionized\natomic nucleus. The first electron will sink down to the lowest-energy\nconfiguration possible: the ground state. If you add a second electron, it\nwill also try to get down to the ground state, but will find that it\u2019s already\noccupied. To minimize the energy of its configuration, it drops into the same\nstate, but needs to have its spin reversed: +1\u20442 if the first electron was\n-1\u20442; -1\u20442 if the first was +1\u20442. Any further electrons need to go into a\nprogressively higher and higher energy state; no two electrons can have the\nsame exact quantum configuration in the same physical system.\n\nThe energy levels and electron wavefunctions that correspond to different\nstates within a hydrogen atom, although the configurations are extremely\nsimilar for all atoms. The way atoms bind together to form molecules and\nother, more complex structures is a challenging task when one begins from\nfundamental particles and interactions, but understanding the basics is how we\nbuild up to explaining more complex systems.\n\nCredit: PoorLeno/Wikimedia Commons\n\nBut this is not true for bosons. You can place as many bosons in the ground-\nstate configuration as you like, with no restrictions. If you create the right\nphysical conditions \u2014 such as cooling a system of bosons and confining them to\nthe same physical location \u2014 there is no limit to the number of bosons that\nyou can fit into that lowest-energy state. When you reach this configuration,\nof many bosons all in the same, lowest-energy quantum state, you\u2019ve achieved\nthe sixth state of matter: a Bose-Einstein condensate.\n\nHelium, an atom made of two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons, is a\nstable atom made of an even number of fermions, and therefore behaves as a\nboson. At low enough temperatures, it becomes a superfluid: a fluid with zero\nviscosity and no friction between itself or any container that it interacts\nwith. These properties are a consequence of Bose-Einstein condensation. While\nhelium was the first boson to achieve this sixth state of matter, it has since\nbeen reproduced for gases, molecules, quasi-particles and even photons. It\nremains an active area of research today.\n\nA Bose-Einstein condensate of rubidium atoms before (L), during (middle) and\nafter (R) the transition to a BEC state is complete. The graphic shows three-\ndimensional successive snap shots in time in which the atoms condensed from\nless dense red, yellow and green areas into very dense blue to white areas.\n\n(Credit: ESA/University of Florence)\n\nFermions, on the other hand, cannot all be in the same quantum state. White\ndwarf stars and neutron stars don\u2019t collapse because of the Pauli Exclusion\nPrinciple; electrons in adjacent atoms (in white dwarfs) or neutrons that\nborder one another (in neutron stars) cannot fully collapse under their own\ngravity, because of the quantum pressure provided by the Pauli Exclusion\nPrinciple. The same principle that\u2019s responsible for atomic structure keeps\nthese dense configurations of matter from collapsing down to black holes; two\nfermions cannot occupy the same quantum state.\n\nTravel the Universe with astrophysicist Ethan Siegel. Subscribers will get the\nnewsletter every Saturday. All aboard!\n\nSo how, then, can you achieve the seventh state of matter: a Fermionic\ncondensate? Believe it or not, the story of Fermionic condensates goes all the\nway back to the 1950s, with an incredible discovery by the Nobel-winning\nphysicist Leon Cooper. The term you\u2019ll want to remember is named after him:\nCooper pairs.\n\nIn a very low temperature conductor, negatively charged electrons will\nslightly change the configurations of the positive charges in the conductor,\ncausing electrons to experience a slightly attractive relative force. This\nleads to the effect of them pairing up to form Cooper pairs, the first form of\na fermionic condensate ever discovered.\n\n(Credit: Tem5psu/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nAt low temperatures, every particle tends towards its lowest-energy, ground-\nstate configuration. If you take a conducting metal and lower the temperature\nsufficiently, two electrons of opposite spins will pair together; this tiny\nattraction will cause electrons to pair up as a less energetic, more stable\nconfiguration than to have all your electrons moving individually.\n\nFermionic condensates require lower temperatures than Bose-Einstein\ncondensates do, but they also behave as a superfluid. In 1971, helium-3 (with\none fewer neutron than standard helium) was shown to become a superfluid at\ntemperatures below 2.5 millikelvin, the first demonstration of a superfluid\ninvolving only fermions. In 2003, physicist Deborah Jin\u2019s laboratory created\nthe first atomic-based Fermionic condensate, leveraging a strong magnetic\nfield along with ultra-cold temperatures to coax the atoms into this sought-\nafter state.\n\nWhile solids, liquids and gases may be the most common states of matter, at\nextremely low temperatures, condensates can emerge, with unique physical\nproperties.\n\n(Credit: Johan Jarnestad/The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences)\n\nIn addition to the three standard states of matter \u2014 solid, liquid, and gas \u2014\nthere are higher-energy states of an ionized plasma, arising wherever atoms\nand molecules have too few electrons to be electrically neutral, and then of a\nquark-gluon plasma, where even protons and neutrons are broken up into their\nfundamental subatomic constituents. However, at ultra-low temperatures, the\ntwo fundamental classes of particles, bosons and fermions, can each condense\ntogether in their own particular fashion, creating Bose-Einstein or Fermionic\ncondensates, respectively: the sixth and seventh states of matter.\n\nIn order to create a Fermionic condensate out of matter, however, you have to\nachieve extraordinary conditions: temperatures below 50 nanokelvin with an\napplied time-varying magnetic field. However, in the vast abyss of space, it\u2019s\neminently possible that neutrinos (made of fermions) or dark matter (which\ncould be fermions or bosons) clump together to form their own condensates. The\nkey to solving one of the greatest mysteries of the Universe \u2014 the dark matter\npuzzle \u2014 might lie in the rarest and most extreme of all the known states of\nmatter.\n\nTags\n\nparticle physics\n\nIn this article\n\nparticle physics\n\nRelated\n\nStarts With A Bang\n\nWhat is the strongest material on Earth?\n\nFor millennia, diamonds were the hardest known material, but they only rank at\n#7 on the current list.
