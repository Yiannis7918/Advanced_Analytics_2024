Google Hardware SVP Rick Osterloh will lead the new\n\"Platforms and Devices\u201d division. Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's previous head\nof software platforms like Android and ChromeOS, will be headed to \"some new\nprojects\" at Google.\n\n\"Having a unified team across Platforms & Devices will help us deliver higher\nquality products and experiences for our users and partners,\" writes Google\nCEO Sundar Pichai. \"It will help us turbocharge the Android and Chrome\necosystems, and bring the best innovations to partners faster \u2014 as we did with\nCircle to Search with Samsung. And internally, it will also speed up decision-\nmaking.\"\n\nGoogle also justifies the decision the same way it does most decisions\nnowadays: by saying it's AI-related. The announcement is a few paragraphs in a\nwide-ranging post by Pichai, titled, \"Building for our AI future,\" and the new\ndivision is taking a chunk of Google Research along with it, specifically the\ngroup that has been working on computational photography. Pichai wants the\nteam to live in \"the intersection of hardware, software, and AI.\"\n\nOsterloh's tweet on the reorganization reads: \"Excited to take on this new\nchallenge and accelerate AI innovation across the Android ecosystem, I look\nforward to working with @Cristianoamon [Qualcomm's CEO] and his team and\nincreasing our strategic collaboration with @Qualcomm and @Snapdragon for\nAndroid, not just in mobile but across compute, XR and auto.\" Dedicating the\nentire second half of that post to Qualcomm is interesting. Google's\ndevelopment of the in-house Pixel Tensor chip with Samsung has put Osterloh's\nhardware division at odds with Qualcomm, Android's biggest chip partner. At\nthe Pixel 6 launch, Osterloh said Google was \"held back for years\" in AI\nbefore it started making its own chips, which was a shot at the Qualcomm chips\nit was previously using. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon replied, too\u2014apparently\nthe two executives are publicly making nice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe'll see exactly how the rest of the Android ecosystem reacts to this, though\nthey've probably already been briefed about it. When Google started making\nPixel phones, there was supposed to be a \"firewall\" between the Android and\nhardware teams\u2014an assurance to partners that Google wouldn't play favorites\nwith its in-house hardware team. That also means Osterloh, specifically, is\nthe person who has been \"firewalled\" off from the rest of the Android\necosystem, and now he's in charge of everything. Longtime Googler Sameer Samat\nis taking over as president of Android Ecosystem, and since he was previously\nthe VP of that role under Lockheimer, he has all the ecosystem relationships\nalready.\n\nSomewhat undercutting the announcement is an interview Osterloh gave to The\nVerge about the re-org, where, when asked about the legendary firewall, he\nindicated it would still stick around: \u201cWe have always kept distinct teams\nbetween Android and our ecosystem partners, and our first-party hardware\nefforts.\u201d Hope that clears everything up.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n44\n\nRon Amadeo Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in\nAndroid OS and Google products.
