I picked an\nolder generation Samsung phone with a relatively small screen. I am not going\nto claim that this came without it\u2019s benefits:\n\n  * first of all, I could finally take notes when I am out and about. which as someone big on note-taking/zettelkasten was a massive upgrade from.. keeping things in my brain.\n  * I can also text, very basic I know, but as you can imagine no one in my social circle was using good ol\u2019 SMS and before my smartphone era, my only option was to call them. yet another point for smartphones.\n\ndespite my efforts to stay out of the loop, I inevitably got on track with the\nrest of the world and started consuming short-form content. even though I\nalways actively refuse to install TikTok, YouTube\u2019s introduction of shortsTM\nwas the start of my addiction.\n\na few months ago, I started noticing that my addiction was growing. of course\nit was nowhere near what kids spend these days on average, but it was still\nconcerning to me and I knew I had to do something about it.\n\nand so I came up with a plan, a productivity law you might say:\n\n> You can spend as much time as you want having fun, as long as it is\n> deliberate.\n\nimagine if this article blows up on Hackernews and people start calling this\nthe yusuf-effect..\n\nso what exactly is deliberate fun? it\u2019s the type of fun where you concisely\ndecide to do it, not because of habit or addiction, and certainly not doom\nscrolling on twitter (X?).\n\nhere are some examples of deliberate fun, some of which I don\u2019t practice but\nyou might enjoy:\n\n  * Playing video games. preferably offline, stroy-driven games, competitve games tend to get very addicting very quickly\n  * Watching movies.\n  * Playing the Guitar, or whatever instrument you play.\n  * hiking, if that\u2019s what you fancy.\n  * Some parents allow their kids to stay up as much as they want as long as they\u2019re reading a book, that\u2019s a form of the law stated above.\n\na question that might pop up is: \u201cWell, won\u2019t I get addicted to these\ninstead?\u201d and the answer \u2014 again, in my experience \u2014 is no.\n\nI just never found myself playing games for more than 2 hours at a time, same\nfor reading. and even if I spent the same amount of time doing deliberate fun,\ncompared to mindless scrolling, deliberate fun always seems like a better\noption.\n\nsomething you may notice if you decide to implement this into your life is\nthat commitment to deliberate fun is hard, very hard.\n\nthe reason is that when you are about to start scrolling on Twitter, you don\u2019t\nsee exactly the amount of time that you\u2019ll spend there, instead time will pass\nby without you noticing, this is not the case when watching a movie.\n\nin your mind, spending 2 hours watching a movie might be an insane idea,\n\u201cimagine all the productive things I could be doing now\u201d you might say, but\nwhen scrolling through twitter, you only realise that you spent a lot of time\nafter the fact.\n\nto combat that here are some solutions I came up with:\n\n  1. make it easier to get started if your guitar is above the closet, put it next to your office table. Have books at arm\u2019s reach in every room of the house, so you can pick up one when you are bored in the toilet.\n  2. conversely, make it harder to reach your cellphone when you come home from work, turn off your phone, and put it away, you can still check up on messages from your computer.\n  3. Actually apply the rule there is a reason I said as much time as you want above, it\u2019s to remove the self shaming that you might go through if you want to block-out time for deliberate fun.\n\nand that\u2019s about it, I hope you learned something and I\u2019ll see you next time!\n\nShare on Hackernews Donate on Ko-fi\n\nLoading Webmentions...\n\nRSS/ now/ about/\n\n(get-decoded-time) \u00a9 Yusuf Bouzekri\n\n", "frontpage": false}
