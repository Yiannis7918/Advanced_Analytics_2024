During build these are fetched as GIT sub modules and\ncompiled automatically.\n\n  * REST-API https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin\n  * OTA-Update https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-ota-plugin\n\nAnother important sub module is the deCONZ library https://github.com/dresden-\nelektronik/deconz-lib which provides API interfaces for the deCONZ core as\nwell as plug-ins.\n\nThe web based Phoscon App is not part of this repository. It is fetched\nexternally as zip file and included during build in the resulting installer\npackage.\n\n## Building\n\nRefer to BUILDING.md for instructions to create packages for various operating\nsystems. Note these instruction currently only cover producing the release\nbuilds. In general you can use any IDE which supports CMake projects like VS\nCode, CLion or Qt creator to compile, run and debug deCONZ.\n\n## Development\n\nSince a while deCONZ v2.x is under a heavier shape shift with the following\ngoals:\n\n  * Separate the Qt GUI from the core. The current \"legacy\" Qt GUI will become a separate GIT repository, development is also ongoing for a next generation GUI.\n  * The core and plug-ins should ultimately run on resource constraint systems with 8-32 MB RAM, like OpenWrt routers, even with large networks and hundreds of nodes.\n  * Remove dependencies on Qt and several other 3rd party libraries. The deCONZ library is extended to build up a complete replacement for the functionality we're using currently from Qt. The GCFFlasher 4 rewrite has shown that it's possible to reduce a Qt based 3.9 MB executable to 20 KB one with no non-native dependencies. Many of the utility functions are also reused in deCONZ core and plug-ins. Ultimately we only need to depend on a crypto library like OpenSSL, LibreSSL or BoringSSL and SQLite.\n  * Move remaining functionality from Zigbee Device Profile (ZDP) like querying neighbor tables to the REST-API Device class which maintains a holistic view of the state of each device.\n  * Currently deCONZ connects directly to the coordinator hardware via USB or serial interface and supports only one Zigbee network. The plan is to connect via local or network socket to GCFFlasher 4 https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/gcfflasher which holds the actual hardware connection. This way firmware updates can be handled again via API. Further Zigbee coordinator hardware can be freely placed, either on the same machine running deCONZ or another machine in the network. Another goal is to support multiple connections in parallel to split up large networks (more than 500 devices), while still having a combined view of them and support rule based automations across Zigbee networks.\n\nNote these are all heavy tasks so there's no ETA, to stay tuned it's best to\nmonitor the respective GIT repositories.\n\n## About\n\ndeCONZ core generic Zigbee application\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nBSD-3-Clause license\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n0 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n2 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * C++ 85.6%\n  * Shell 8.2%\n  * C 4.1%\n  * CMake 1.2%\n  * NSIS 0.9%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
