With that in mind, here are the VERY ROUGH notes of the talk I gave\nrecently at the first ever Ignite Miami:]\n\n1\\. Like everybody else here tonight, I give a lot of thought to \u201cSuccess\u201d.\nWhat does it take to be successful, prosprous, happy, have a sense of purpose\netc? What does THAT actually look like?\n\n2\\. And by successful, I don\u2019t mean \u201clucky\u201d. I don\u2019t mean people born rich or\nlottery winners. That kind of success never comes from within, that kind of\nsuccess is too external and random to bother worrying about.\n\n3\\. Of course, the media LOVE success models of the outrageously fortunate-\ncelebrity artists, celebrity businessmen, celebrity spiritual leaders, not to\nmention the Reality TV, famous-for-being-famous crowd.\n\n4\\. The thing is, I know TONS of super successful people, but none of them fit\nthis extreme, celeb-lottery-winner TV model. Some of them are actually pretty\nboring, to be honest. But they lead happy lives and do VERY well careerwise.\nTHAT is what most success looks like, if you think about it. The stuff on TV\nor in the movies just isn\u2019t REAL enough to be that useful for us.\n\n5\\. So I was thinking about this again, recently, HARD. What model would work\nfor these people, folk like you and me? A model that didn\u2019t mean you had to\nsell your soul to Wall Street, Hollywood or Washington? A success model that\ndoesn\u2019t rely solely on the unlikelihood of outrageously good fortune or plain,\ndumb luck?\n\n6\\. Then quite by chance, I saw a great documentary the other week: \u201cJiro\nDreams of Sushi\u201d, a film about the world\u2019s greatest sushi master, and a\nlightbulb EXPLODED in my head.\n\n7\\. Our man, Jiro is eighty five years old (EIGHTY FIVE!), doesn\u2019t have a lot\nof money or own a fleet of trendy restaurants in all the world\u2019s capitals,\na-la Wolfgang Puck. He\u2019s just being doing it for 60 years; he just has just a\nsmall, plain, dingy, ordinary, low-key sushi bar with ten seats in a Tokyo\nsubway, the kind you\u2019d probably just walk by without stopping if you saw it.\nTen seats! Yet he\u2019s the best in the world at what he does.\n\n8\\. Jiro works over 350 days a year, serves sushi and sashimi to people in\nvery small numbers, and THAT\u2019S IT. Just sushi. No salad, no appetizers, no\ndeserts. Like I said, JUST SUSHI. And by sticking to this bare-bones formula,\nhe\u2019s become the first sushi chef in the world to win three Michelin stars.\n\n9\\. A tiny little sushi bar in some random subway station. Yet people wait in\nline, people book a stool at his sushi bar as much as a year in advance, a\nprices starting around $600 a head. People have been known to fly all the way\nfrom America or Europe, just to experience a 30-minute meal. In a subway\nstation!\n\n10\\. I was lucky enough to have a similar experience first-hand when about\neight years ago, I started working with the English Savile Row tailors. They\nmake the best suits in the world; all hand-made, they go for about $5000 a\npop.\n\n11\\. The tailors have a similar shtick as Jiro. They\u2019re generally not that\nrich, their businesses are tiny, yet the great and the good worship at their\nfeet. Celebrities, captains of industry, people who are also world-class at\nwhat they do, like Jiro\u2019s customers, waiting as long as a year in advance to\nget their next suit.\n\n12\\. Like Jiro, the tailors just get up every morning and do their thing, day-\nin-day-out, humbly, quietly, without a lot of fanfare, totally dedicated to\ntheir jobs. I\u2019ve seen it. On the surface, it\u2019s quiet, calm and kinda dull.\n\n13\\. And like Jiro, from my observations they seem to have this sense of inner\nsatisfaction my Wall Street trader friends (who easily make ten times as much,\non a good day) can only dream of.\n\n14\\. As a result, Jiro and the Savile Row tailors are the people I really try\nto emulate. Because it\u2019s doable. I can do that. I may never be as rich as\nSteve Jobs or Warren Buffet, I may never be literally a rock star like Bono or\nJagger, but I can be like Jiro and the tailors... or at least, more like them.\n\n15\\. And like them, I live very low-key; I get up every morning and quietly\nget on with the business cranking out my product, my cartoons. Like I said,\nquiet, calm and kinda dull.\n\n16\\. So what\u2019s their secret? THE secret? What is the secret sauce that lets\nthese otherwise quite ordinary people like Jiro and the tailors, lead such\nextraordinary lives?\n\n17\\. In a word: MASTERY. They\u2019ve MASTERED something. Something interesting and\nvaluable. They are MASTERS of their craft. It may be an old-fashioned word\nthat makes people uncomfortable, but that\u2019s only because it\u2019s something that\neludes most people.\n\n18\\. Though, having watched these masters carefully first-hand, I can honestly\nsay MASTERY is more satisfying than money (and I\u2019ve seen both, trust me). If\nyou\u2019re up for it, yes, MASTERY MATTERS MORE THAN MONEY, MASTERY MATTERS MORE\nTHAN SUCCESS.\n\n19\\. And it\u2019s portable. It travels with you, wherever you go. No landlord, no\nboss, no recession, no Wall Street analyst, no newspaper critic can take it\naway. It\u2019s something that truly belongs to you, for always.\n\n20\\. So when a young person asks me for career advice these days, I tell her,\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about so much about money, fame, success, whatever. Worry about\nMastery- that is something precious you can actually control. And yes, if\nyou\u2019ve achieved mastery, you\u2019re more likely to be successful and prosperous,\nanyway.\u201d Again, MASTERY MATTERS MORE THAN SUCCESS. So go for it. Thank you.\n\n[P.S.: Thanks to Alex and Ana for making this happen for me.

In fact I was just having a conversation with a man and\nhis college age daughter about this. Mastery is what the youth underrate \u2013 and\nwhat I underrated in my youth. It was all about exploration and adventure\nthen.\n\nFine, but here\u2019s the problem. If you don\u2019t get your 10,000 or so hours into\nsomething early on, it\u2019s hard to get it later sometimes.\n\nBecause when you get into the McJob world later, you may not be able to master\nthe things that would play into your strength, your happiness, your soul.\n\nAs a friend of mine put it, \u201cI\u2019m afraid of becoming mediocre by excelling at\nuseless things.\u201d Which is why there is an urgency to acquiring mastery in\nsomething soul-fulfilling before you find yourself mastering dull skills.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nChris Kernaghan\n\n11 years ago\n\nReply to Jon Reed\n\nI totally agree, the problem with Mastery when you do not work for yourself,\nis that people mistake this as the ability to move up the ladder. Sometimes\npeople just want to do the thing that they love and not move to the next level\nof doing it. These people are often criticised for being lazy, boring or\nwasters. Whilst I agree with Seth Godin that you should not chase approval,\nbeing effectively discrimated against for being content with your lot seems a\nlittle harsh as well.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nrebecca @ altared spaces\n\n11 years ago\n\nI think you\u2019ve got it: what it takes to cultivate mastery and thus success is\npretty boring day to day. Just do the work, again and again.\n\nIt lacks the drama of reality TV and I think there are many of us who can\u2019t\nquite tolerate that quiet life. Yet we long for the rewards.\n\nUm your minimalist guy up above? I think the reason he sucks at so much is\nthat his arms are too short. He\u2019s like T-rex: Big body, unable to hold onto a\nmeal/pencil. I could mail you a pencil if you\u2019re running short.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nAlex de Carvalho\n\n11 years ago\n\nHugh, thank you for participating in the first Ignite Miami and for motivating\neveryone with your great presentation.

Reminds me of Fletcher Chouinard\u2019s\nsurfboards.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nSheila Foley\n\n11 years ago\n\nSo true \u2013 and in the mind of the master, it\u2019s all about the process rather\nthan the product. Cliche though it may be, it\u2019s the journey not the\ndestination. The master never sees him/herself as such. The master is always\nlearning.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nRusty\n\n11 years ago\n\nReply to Sheila Foley\n\nGood point @sheila and great article @.\n\nI think its also equally important to be present in your mastery as opposed to\nalways peering over the top of the hill. While its critical to have a goal,\nhaving one that\u2019s too far off can make it frustratingly elusive as well as\nmisguided over time. For example, choosing to have mastery over website design\nwould be a rewarding and potentially lucrative endeavor today. In 5 years, you\nmay find that the world is shifting away from the browser. You have to allow\nyourself to evolve with the world you live in. Choosing to have mastery in\nsteam engine repair might, on the other hand, be purely a hobby pursuit.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t just apply to technology. Consider physicians and the shrinking\nopportunity available to a young surgeon. It is not the people who do what\ntheir mentors did who will be successful in the future. It is those who\ninnovate out of current situation, those whose vision is tied to their passion\nrather than their career path, who will break free from the grind of the\nmodern world.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nLucky Love\n\n11 years ago\n\nReply to Sheila Foley\n\nShelia, you\u2019ve nailed it: \u201cin the mind of the master, it\u2019s all about the\nprocess rather than the product.The master is always learning.\u201d\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nThe Mosquito that could eat a Camel \u00ab Open Cyprus Europe 2012\n\n11 years ago\n\n[...] Follow the link to the 20 points that will save you from short sighted success.

Your story reminded me of the reasons I hop out of bed.\nSometimes I lose track, but you\u2019re right, more so than money and other\nexternal comforts, mastery is the greatest gem of all. I remember reading a\nbook a while back called Mastery (by George Leonard). If you\u2019re unfamiliar\nwith it, PLEASE pick it up. It\u2019s very short, but it\u2019s saturated with lessons\nthat reform our patterns of thought so that we operate in a state of mastery\n(in a addition to mastering a specific skill). That might not make sense now,\nbut read it!\n\nThanks for sharing your insights!\n\nNima\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nPat Sandy\n\n11 years ago\n\nReply to Nima\n\nNima \u2013 I actually have the George Leonard book, and read it quite a few times\nback in the day \u2013 excellent book...\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nScott\n\n11 years ago\n\nInteresting post and it\u2019s good that you know what success means to you.\n\nHowever, this definition definitely would not suit me, and I\u2019m sure there are\nlots of people out there that it wouldn\u2019t suit either. If I had a life\nanything like this Jiro guy, I think I would consider it a miserable failure.\nMaking sushi for 60 years seems like such a pointless endeavour. The world\nwould be absolutely fine without sushi. And if I sold suits for $5000 I would\njust consider myself lucky that there were so many stupid people out there\nwilling to pay that much money for clothing.\n\nMastery for the sake of mastery seems like an absolute waste of a life to me.\nThat said, I do see mastery as something that can be a means to another end.\n\nSuccess to me is maximizing the total amount of happiness and satisfaction in\none\u2019s lifetime.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nEditor\n\nHugh MacLeod\n\n11 years ago\n\nReply to Scott\n\n\u201cSuccess to me is maximizing the total amount of happiness and satisfaction in\none\u2019s lifetime.\u201d\n\nReally, Scott?

It\u2019s effortless to be\nexcellent. And often breathtaking to watch. Also, in many\u2013if not most\u2013fields,\nmastery must include innovation and creativity, so I think not necessarily\nboring.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nGreg\n\n11 years ago\n\nThis sushi guy might not care about mastery. It was probably not a goal at\nall. Who knows? In mastery, there an \u201cego\u201d thing that keeps people on the dark\nside. It looks to me like he just focused and that\u2019s it. With focus comes flow\n(mihaly\u2019s book), and with flow comes the deepest happiness you could imagine.\nAnd of course comes mastery, but not sure it should be a goal in itself. Just\nmy point of view. What fits for a person, does not for another.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nEditor\n\nHugh MacLeod\n\n11 years ago\n\nReply to Greg\n\nYeah, Greg, that seems to be the case with the tailors I knew.
