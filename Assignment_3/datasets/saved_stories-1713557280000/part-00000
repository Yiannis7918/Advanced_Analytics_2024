The solution would be to add Firefox as an\noption to that list along with the other browsers (such as duckduckgo or\necosia browser) so that the user can decide to use for example duckduckgo\nthrough Firefox instead of their browser. This would also remove the need to\nhave more than one browser installed\n\nScreenshot_20240315-141559.png\n\nSee more ideas labeled with:\n\n  * Mobile\n  * Mobile-Android\n  * Search\n\n  * android\n\n  * DMA\n\n  * duckduckgo\n\n  * google\n\n  * search engine\n\nScreenshot_20240315-141559.png\n\nPreview file\n\n148 KB\n\n14 Kudos\n\nComment\n\n  * Back to Idea Exchange\n  * Previous\n  * Next\n\n1 Comment\n\nStatus changed to: New idea\n\nJon\n\nCommunity Manager\n\n  * Mark as Read\n  * Mark as New\n  * Bookmark\n  * Permalink\n  * Print\n  * Report Inappropriate Content\n\n03-15-2024 07:01 AM\n\n03-15-2024 07:01 AM\n\nThanks for submitting an idea to the Mozilla Connect community!
