Many believe the\nattempt to backdoor Linux\u2019s xz data compression library might not be an\nisolated incident. According to the OpenJS Foundation and Open Source Security\nFoundation (OpenSSF), there has been a series of suspicious emails that appear\ntargeted at a popular unnamed JavaScript project that the OpenJS Foundation\nhosts.\n\n## What Targeted Threats Have Been Identified Targeting Open-Source\nMaintainers?\n\nThe emails were sent from different names, all with GitHub-associated email\naddresses, and were constructed around the same theme. The suspected attackers\nwere trying to get themselves added as project maintainers to \u201caddress any\ncritical vulnerabilities\u201d but didn\u2019t provide details on these vulnerabilities,\nwhich raises suspicion. This approach is similar to how the backdoor was\nintroduced into XZ/liblzma, and as a result, it has been flagged as a\npotential security danger.\n\nTwo other popular JS projects also received similar messages, raising more\nconcern that certain groups of attackers are looking to introduce backdoors\ninto open-source projects. Moreover, OpenJS immediately flagged the potential\nsecurity concerns to cybersecurity and infrastructure security agencies within\nthe United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nThis kind of attack is not new, yet it seems an effective way for attackers to\ninfiltrate an open-source project. Therefore, it is critical to note that\nproject maintainers must be extra vigilant and perform rigorous checks when\nadding contributors as maintainers. According to the article, this attack\nmethod utilizes social engineering techniques and exploits a sense of duty\nthat maintainers feel toward their projects to infiltrate them.\n\n## What Can Be Done to Combat This Threat?\n\nThe attack method exploits the maintainers\u2019 sense of social responsibility to\ndeceive them. As such, promoting technical expertise and sharing knowledge\nabout emerging threats and attack methods is imperative. Additionally, it is\nnecessary to ensure that open-source projects are well-funded and their\nmaintainers are adequately supported. This would serve as a significant\ndeterrent against potential social engineering attacks.\n\nAs such, governments and other organizations must allocate resources to help\nsecure the broader open-source ecosystem. Funding for security developers has\nalready had a tremendous effect, for example, the security-focused Alpha-Omega\nproject, which Microsoft, Amazon, and Google support. Germany\u2019s Sovereign Tech\nFund aims to support foundations like OpenJS to strengthen infrastructure and\nsecurity.\n\n## Our Final Thoughts on This Attack\n\nThis attack is a clear example of how attackers can infiltrate open-source\nprojects by exploiting users\u2019 trust to introduce backdoors. Consequently, we\nrecommend coordinating efforts from different organizations and collaborating\nglobally within the open-source ecosystem. In essence, this will help ensure\nthat open-source developers are better equipped to identify such threats and\nmitigate them promptly. Therefore, more resources, a coordinated approach,\nknowledge sharing, and adequate funding are imperative in raising open-source\nsecurity levels to protect our interconnected open-source projects and shared\ndigital economies.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n1 - 0 min read\n\nApr 12, 2024\n\nGrowth in Open Source Use Among Businesses Analyzed\n\n1 - 0 min read\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nThreat Actors Are Actively Using Pupy RAT Malware to Attack Linux Systems\n\n1 - 0 min read\n\nMar 04, 2024\n\nWhite House Warns: Move to Memory-Safe Languages\n\n1 - 0 min read\n\nMar 26, 2024\n\nHighlights & Takeaways from SCALE 21x: A Community Event Beyond Linux\n\n1 - 0 min read\n\nMar 15, 2024\n\nOpen Source is Not Insecure, Despite Common Misconceptions\n\n1 - 0 min read\n\nMar 08, 2024\n\nIt\u2019s Time to Add Some GUAC to Open-Source Supply Chain Security!\n\n### Related Articles\n\n### Navigating the Open Source Security Landscape in 2024\n\n### Linus Torvalds on the State of Linux Today and How AI Figures in Its\nFuture\n\n### Linux Distros Need to Take More Responsibility for Security\n\n## LinuxSecurity Poll\n\n#### Why do you use a VPN on Linux?\n\nMessage!\n\nNo answer selected.
