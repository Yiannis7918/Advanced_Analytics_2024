Features like our AI DJ and daylist power\nthose discoveries and bring fans closer to the artists they love. Now we\u2019re\nproviding our Spotify Premium subscribers with another tool to fuel discovery\nand music curation. With AI Playlist in beta, you can effortlessly turn your\nmost creative ideas into playlists.\n\nStarting with users on Android and iOS devices in the United Kingdom and\nAustralia, creating a new playlist with AI Playlist is as simple as typing a\nunique prompt into the chat. Looking for \u201can indie folk playlist to give my\nbrain a big warm hug,\u201d \u201crelaxing music to tide me over during allergy season,\u201d\nor \u201ca playlist that makes me feel like the main character\u201d? AI Playlist has\nyou covered. Whether you\u2019re a beginner or an expert playlist creator, AI\nPlaylist pairs our powerful personalization technology with AI to deliver that\nperfect musical mix just for you.\n\nYou can use prompts that reference places, animals, activities, movie\ncharacters, colors, even emojis! The most successful playlists are generated\nwith prompts that contain a combination of genres, moods, artists, or decades.\nIt\u2019s a brand-new tool, and it is still in beta, so we\u2019ll continue to iterate\nand innovate on the experience. Stay tuned on what\u2019s to come!\n\n### Get started with AI Playlist:\n\nTo find AI Playlist, head to the Spotify mobile app and select \u201cYour Library\u201d\nat the bottom-right corner of your screen.\n\n  * From Your Library, tap the \u201c+\u201d button at the top-right corner of the app and select \u201cAI Playlist.\u201d\n  * Select one of the suggested prompts or type your own. Get creative and be specific! For example, you could try creating \u201csad music for painting dying flowers\u201d or \u201ctracks for horse riding into the sunset.\u201d\n  * Wait as we do our magic. Spotify will offer some tracks that match the vibe you\u2019re going for.\n  * From there, you can easily manage the selection of songs by previewing and deleting tracks. Have notes? You can revise and refine the playlists you generate by telling AI Playlist what you\u2019re looking for (i.e., \u201cmore pop\u201d or \u201cless upbeat\u201d).\n  * Tap \u201cCreate,\u201d and your new playlist will be saved automatically in Your Library.\n\nJust like that, Spotify will help you curate a personalized playlist based on\nthe tracks, artists, and genres we think you\u2019ll like. While it\u2019s designed to\nbe fun, the tool is still in beta and won\u2019t produce results for non-music-\nrelated prompts, like current events or specific brands. We also have measures\nin place around prompts that are offensive\u2014so please prompt responsibly!\n\nAt Spotify, we aim to deliver the right piece of music for that exact moment\nin time. With AI Playlist in beta, we\u2019re excited to give Premium subscribers\nin the U.K. and Australia a brand-new way to discover music. Over the coming\nmonths, we look forward to continuing to iterate on this new feature to best\nserve our listeners.\n\n  * Share\n\n## Up Next\n\n## Up Next\n\nInside Spotify\n\n### How Spotify Uses Design To Make Personalization Features Delightful\n\n## Discover More\n\nWhat's New\n\n### Spotify Unveils Jam, a New, Personalized Way to Listen With Your Entire\nSquad\n\nBehind the Mic\n\n### Behind the Scenes of Spotify\u2019s New AI DJ\n\nWhat's New\n\n### Discover and Listen to Music With Even More Friends and Family\u2014Plus Some\nof Your Favorite Artists\u2014With Spotify\u2019s Newest Blend Update\n\n  * Legal\n  * Privacy Center\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookies\n  * About Ads\n\n\u00a9 2024 Spotify AB.\n\nListen on Spotify\n\n## We Care About Your Privacy\n\nWe and our 221 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
