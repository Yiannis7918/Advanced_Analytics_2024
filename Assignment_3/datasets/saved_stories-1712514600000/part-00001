A Drone\nJust Blew One Up In Eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe Ladoga debuted 38 years ago, during the Chernobyl meltdown.\n\nDavid Axe\n\nForbes Staff\n\nI write about ships, planes, tanks, drones, missiles and satellites.\n\nFollowing\n\nClick to save this article.\n\nYou'll be asked to sign into your Forbes account.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nA Ladoga around Chernobyl in 1986.\n\nXnumx\n\nIn the late 1970s, Soviet authorities asked the Kirovsky Design Bureau in\nSaint Petersburg to develop a nuclear reconnaissance and command vehicle.\n\nAnd not just any nuclear reconnaissance and command vehicle, but the best\nprotected, most comfortable nuke vehicle imaginable. A sealed, self-contained\nand thickly-armored turret-less tank with remote cameras and its own oxygen\nsupply.\n\nThe result was the Ladoga. Kirovsky produced just a handful of the tracked\nvehicles\u2014perhaps four or five. One spent some time in the fallout zone around\nthe nuclear power plant in Chernobyl following the plant\u2019s deadly 1986\nmeltdown. Aside from another that landed in a museum, the Ladogas then ...\ndisappeared.\n\nUntil this week, when a Ukrainian drone spotted, and struck, what apparently\nwas a Ladoga rolling toward Ukrainian lines near the Kreminna Forest in\neastern Ukraine.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the Kremlin is struggling to generate enough combat\nvehicles\u2014either through new production or by fetching older vehicles from\nlong-term storage\u2014to make good staggering losses (15,000 vehicles and\ncounting) along the 600-mile front line of Russia\u2019s 25-month wider war on\nUkraine.\n\nThat gap between the newly generated vehicles\u2014500 or 600 tanks a year plus a\nthousand or so fighting vehicles\u2014and annual losses that average 1,300 tanks\nand 1,700 fighting vehicles helps to explain why some very strange vehicles\nhave showed up along the front line. Perhaps most notably, Chinese-made golf-\ncarts.\n\nCompared to an unarmored, open-top golf-cart, the Ladoga is much better-suited\nfor mechanized warfare. It combines the armored hull of a T-80 tank with a\n1,250-horespower gas-turbine engine and a voluminous crew compartment seating\naround four in padded armchairs.\n\nThe Ladoga has a mast-mounted television camera and a full suite of radios\nthat would have allowed the vehicle to work in a doomsday command role.\nImagine Soviet leaders speeding to safety inside a Ladoga, directing their own\nnuclear forces as NATO nukes rain down.\n\nNow imagine some Russian colonel commanding his battalion from a Ladoga\u2019s cozy\ninterior during an attack on Ukrainian forces around Kreminna.\n\nThe tiny force of Ladogas got a workout around Chernobyl but never performed\nits primary role in an atomic apocalypse. Surely no one at Kirovsky imagined\nan aged Ladoga eventually would find its way to the front line of a non-\nnuclear war in 2024.\n\nBut then, its hard to imagine the engineers in Saint Petersburg 50 years ago\ncould imagine Russia losing 15,000 armored vehicles in just two years in a war\nwith, of all countries, an independent and NATO-aligned Ukraine.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.
