While other browser benchmarks exist,\nSpeedometer 3 is the new standard for how we measure the speed of your\nbrowsing experience. The latest tests better reflect the web of today \u2014\nworking with visually rich charts, editing text, interacting with complicated\nand heavy web pages like news sites \u2014 and it measures a full picture of the\nbrowser\u2019s performance.\n\nThe new Speedometer 3 benchmark is the first major browser benchmark that\u2019s\never been developed through a collaboration supported by every major browser,\ndesigned to benefit the entire web.\n\n## Faster every day\n\nFirefox is powered by the world-class Gecko engine, with shockingly fast\nstyling and page layout, modern JavaScript features and a never-ending\ndrumbeat of new performance improvements to keep our users happy and push the\nweb platform forward.\n\nAll browsers had to make improvements in order to perform well on the new\nSpeedometer 3 tests. Firefox in particular made huge strides, getting\nnoticeably faster for our users as a direct result of this work. Firefox is\nfaster than ever before, with speed you can really feel, including faster page\nloads and smoother interactions.\n\n## Towards a faster web\n\nMozilla is committed to continuously improving our own browser as well as the\nentire web. That\u2019s why we invested in the collaboration to develop Speedometer\n3 which, in turn, has improved the performance of all browsers. So whatever\nbrowser you choose, Mozilla wants it to be fast.\n\n### Do more with Firefox\n\nGet the fast, lightweight, privacy-focused browser that\u2019s backed by a non-\nprofit and works across all your devices.\n\nDownload Firefox\n\nFirefox is no longer supported on Windows 8.1 and below.\n\nPlease download Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release) to use Firefox.\n\nDownload Firefox ESR 64-bit\n\nDownload Firefox ESR 32-bit\n\nDownload a different build\n\nFirefox is no longer supported on macOS 10.14 and below.\n\nPlease download Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release) to use Firefox.\n\nDownload Firefox ESR\n\nFirefox Privacy Notice\n\n", "frontpage": false}
