Early attempts to reach it were primarily motivated by\nthe search for a navigable route through the Arctic to Asia, known as the\nNorthwest Passage. Later, explorers focused specifically on reaching the Pole\nitself. But for centuries, reaching it seemed impossible. The polar\nenvironment was extremely unforgiving. Located in the middle of the Arctic\nOcean, the North Pole is covered by a vast expanse of sea ice which constantly\nchanges due to wind, ocean currents and seasonal melts. Explorers tried to\nreach the pole using ships, dogsleds, and even traveling by foot. The first\nverified, and officially recognized expedition to reach the North Pole didn\u2019t\noccur until 1926 (although several explorers claimed to have reached it\nearlier). It was first reached using the airship Norge, which flew overhead,\nbut did not land on the surface. In the late 1920\u2019s, accomplished explorer Sir\nHubert Wilkins became convinced that a submarine would provide the ultimate\nmeans of reaching the North Pole. A submarine could travel for extended\nperiods beneath the ice, avoiding the extreme hazards above which had caused\nearlier expeditions to fail. Carrying the latest scientific equipment, the\nsubmarine\u2019s crew could conduct valuable meteorological, oceanographic,\nbiological, magnetic, and spectrographic experiments. Wilkin\u2019s submarine would\nbe called the Nautilus. It was a retired WW1-era submarine that had been\nextensively modified by renowned Naval Architect Simon Lake. The Nautilus\nfeatured a heavily reinforced bow, a shock absorber and sledge runners to\nprotect it from collision with sea ice. A diving compartment and airlock was\nalso added to allow divers to explore the depths while the submarine remained\nsubmerged. Most importantly, the Nautilus was fitted with three ice drills,\nallowing the submarine to recharge batteries, refresh air and even allow the\ncrew to exit while the submarine still remained below the ice. The Nautilus\nand her crew of 20 men began their expedition to the North Pole in June of\n1931. None of them realized how grueling their journey would be, and almost\nimmediately things began to go wrong.\n\nShow less Show more\n\nTranscript\n\nFollow along using the transcript.\n\n### Mustard\n\n1.78M subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nSupport us on Patreon\n\nTwitter\n\nInstragram\n\nFacebook\n\nTikTok\n\n## Comments 1K\n\nTop comments\n\nNewest first\n\n## Transcript\n\nNaN / NaN\n\n# What Happened To The Nautilus?\n\nMustard\n\nMustard\n\n1.78M subscribers\n\n<__slot-el>\n\n<__slot-el>\n\nDownload\n\n731,090 views 17 hours ago\n\n731,090 views \u2022 Apr 12, 2024\n\nShow less\n\nGet Nebula for just $2.50 a month here: https://go.nebula.tv/mustard Watch\nMore Mustard Videos & Support The Channel: https://nebula.tv/mustard\n......more\n\n...more\n\nTranscript\n\nFollow along using the transcript.\n\n### Mustard\n\n1.78M subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nSupport us on Patreon\n\nTwitter\n\nInstragram\n\nFacebook\n\nTikTok\n\nShow less\n\n# What Happened To The Nautilus?\n\n731,090 views\n\nApr 12, 2024\n\nDownload\n\nShop the Mustard store\n\n### What Happened To Flying Wings?\n\nMustard\n\nMustard\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n5.8M views 1 year ago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
