It\u2019s a totally\nimpossible, untenable task!\u201d\n\nDan Lorenc, co-founder and CEO of software security provider Chainguard,\ncalled the incident a \u201cmassive issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are now relying on industry alerts and social media to ensure we triage\nCVEs as quickly as possible,\u201d he told Infosecurity.\n\n\u201cScanners, analyzers, and most vulnerability tools rely on the NVD to\ndetermine what software is affected by which vulnerabilities,\u201d Lorenc added.\n\u201cIf organizations cannot triage vulnerabilities effectively, it opens them up\nto increased risk and leaves a significant gap in their vulnerability\nmanagement posture.\u201d\n\nTo stay operational amidst the NVD backlog, several security companies, such\nas VulnCheck, Anchore and RiskHorizon AI, started working on projects that\ncould provide an alternative to some parts of vulnerability disclosure\ntraditionally provided in the NVD.\n\nThis episode coincided with the release of the latest revision of the Federal\nRisk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP Rev. 5), a US federal law\nrequiring any company that wants to do business with the federal government to\nuse the NVD as a source of truth and remediate all known vulnerabilities\ninside it.\n\n## Challenges Within the NVD Led to a \u201cPerfect Storm\u201d\n\nBefore the NIST statement, speculation as to what was happening included:\n\n  * Budget issues within NIST, as lawmakers recently approved a $1.46bn budget for NIST for the current fiscal year, a nearly 12% decrease from the previous year\n  * An ending contract with a contractor, possibly Huntington Ingalls Industries \u2013 a shipbuilding contractor that publicly works with NIST on the NVD\n  * Internal discussions to replace some vulnerability standards used by the NVD, such as Common Product Enumerators (CPEs) that act as fingerprints for IT products, used to clearly identify software, hardware, and systems\n  * Internal discussions to start adopting Package URLs (PURLs), a new standard listing universal addresses for software packages\n\nAt VulnCon, Brewer did not delve much into the reason for the NVD issue,\nsaying, \u201cAlthough there is a story behind it, it is long, convoluted and very\nadministrivia.\u201d\n\nShe added that a few challenges led the NVD program to \u201cthis perfect storm.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn May 2023, I saw that we needed to do things differently and start working\ndifferently with industry. We\u2019ve been working on that ever since.\nUnfortunately, we had our perfect storm and didn\u2019t get it done as quickly as\nwe wanted.\u201d\n\nIn a written statement sent to Infosecurity on March 29, a NIST spokesperson\nsaid that the backlog was \"based on a variety of factors, including an\nincrease in software and therefore vulnerabilities, as well a change in\ninteragency support.\"\n\n\"Currently, we are prioritizing analysis of the most significant\nvulnerabilities. In addition, we are working with our agency partners to bring\non more support for analyzing vulnerabilities and have reassigned additional\nNIST staff to this task as well, the spokesperson added.\n\nBrewer said at VulnCon that NIST has started reallocating personnel and\nincreasing its collaboration with other government agencies over the NVD\nprogram.\n\nShe said enrichment data should start flowing again within a few weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to shut down the NVD; we\u2019re in the process of fixing the\ncurrent problem. And then, we\u2019re going to make the NVD robust again and we\u2019ll\nmake it grow,\u201d she insisted.\n\n## NIST Provide Details on an Upcoming NVD Consortium\n\nOn February 15, the NVD website announced that NIST \u201cis currently working to\nestablish a consortium to address challenges in the NVD program and develop\nimproved tools and methods.\u201d\n\nThis was confirmed by Brewer at VulnCon.\n\nSource: NIST (edited by Infosecurity Magazine)\n\n\u201cAlthough the official paperwork is not out yet, NIST has every intention of\nputting together the NVD Consortium to make the NVD more relevant in the\nfuture. It should be operational within two weeks,\u201d she explained.\n\nThe NVD Consortium will help NIST with funding and feedback on future\ndevelopments.\n\nAlso present at VulnCon, J\u2019aime Maynard, consortia agreements officer at the\nTechnology Partnership Office (TPO), gave information about who can join the\nNVD Consortium and how to do it.\n\nIn summary, candidates must be organizations, sign the same Cooperative\nResearch and Development Agreement (CRADA) with NIST and accept the same\nconditions and risks. A membership fee is being considered.\n\nEntities that are prohibited from signing a CRADA may be allowed to\nparticipate in the Consortium under an alternative appropriate agreement.\n\nEach member will have one seat on the steering committee. The Consortium will\nbe structured into different working groups.\n\nNIST will issue a Federal Register Notice detailing the main objectives of the\nNVD Consortium, how to apply and the relevant points of contact at NIST.\n\nMeanwhile, interested parties can contact the following email address:\nnvd_consortium@nist.gov.\n\n## NVD\u2019s One-to-Five Year Plan\n\nOnce the NVD is up and running, Brewer said the program will consider new\napproaches to improving its processes within the next one to five years,\nespecially around software identification.\n\nSome of the ideas include:\n\n  * Involving more partners: Being able to have outside parties submit CPE data for the CPE Dictionary in ways that scale to fit the ever-growing number of IT products\n  * Software identification improvements: Dealing with software identification in the NVD in a way that scales with growing complexities (the adoption of PURLS is considered)\n  * New types of data: Developing capabilities to publish additional kinds of data to the NVD (e.g. from EPSS, NIST Bugs Framework)\n  * New use cases: Developing a way to make NVD data more consumable and more customizable to targeted use cases (e.g. getting email alerts from NVD when CVEs are published)\n  * CVE JSON 5.0: Expanding the NVD\u2019s capabilities to utilize new data points available in CVE JSON 5.0\n  * Automation: Developing a way to automate at least some CVE analysis activities\n\n\u201cWe want to get away from needing any human analysis for CVE enrichment.\nRecent developments in AI could help,\u201d Brewer insisted.\n\n## Some \u201cLong Overdue Clarity\u201d\n\nBefore VulnCon, many vulnerability researchers criticized NIST\u2019s decision to\nkeep its first public statement for the conference.\n\nThis was illustrated by Lorenc\u2019s comment during Resilient Cyber, a LinkedIn\nvideo podcast hosted by Chris Hughes, president of Aquia. \u201cYou announce a\nflashy new product at a conference, you don\u2019t update the world on what\u2019s going\non with such an important thing as the NVD,\u201d Lorenc said.\n\nHowever, Brewer\u2019s session did answer many questions that vulnerability\nresearchers have been asking NIST for the past month.\n\nSpeaking to Infosecurity, Aquia\u2019s Hughes commented: \u201cThe comments provided\nsome long overdue clarity that the industry has been asking for. The\nforthcoming collaborative approach should bring new support and participation\nand also help longstanding issues such as NVD support for PURL which helps\naddress challenges NVD has right now around the open source ecosystem and\nsoftware supply chain security.\n\n\u201cThe consensus is that this brief disruption is going to help drive broader\nindustry collaboration via the consortium as well as modernizing longstanding\nchallenges with the NVD and its operations and functionality.\u201d\n\nPatrick Garrity, security researcher at VulnCheck, agreed.\n\n\u201cThe presence of NIST NVD at the conference has provided reassurance to the\ncommunity that NIST NVD is actively working to address the current gap in\nprocessing CVEs. While there is no definitive timeline for resolution, it's\nevident that they are diligently working towards a solution, also emphasizing\ncollaboration with the community through a new consortium,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, some voices remain critical regarding Brewer\u2019s VulnCon speech. In a\npost published on March 28 on the Digital Utility Group forum of\nEnergyCentral\u2019s website, Tom Alrich, the co-leader of the OWASP SBOM Forum,\nsaid he regretted that Brewer did not address the nature of the issues the NVD\nprogram has been experiencing or the reason behind the recent backlog.\n\nDozens of cybersecurity experts signed an open letter written by Lorenc and\naddressed to Congress and Gina Raimondo, the US Secretary of Commerce. It\nrequests them to fund and protect the NVD, calling it \u201ccritical infrastructure\nfor a large variety of cybersecurity products.\u201d\n\nThis article was updated on April 2 with comments from NIST.\n\n## You may also like\n\n  1. ### NIST National Vulnerability Database Disruption Sees CVE Enrichment on Hold\n\nNews15 Mar 2024\n\n  2. ### Real Bug Volumes in 2020 Exceed Official CVEs by 29%: Report\n\nNews12 Feb 2021\n\n  3. ### Navigating the Vulnerability Maze: Understanding CVE, CWE, and CVSS\n\nNews Feature28 Dec 2023\n\n  4. ### MITRE Launches Critical Infrastructure Threat Model Framework\n\nNews13 Dec 2023\n\n  5. ### New CVSS Version Unveiled Amid Rising Cyber Threats\n\nNews13 Jul 2023\n\n## What\u2019s hot on Infosecurity Magazine?\n\n### Wiz Discovers Flaws in GenAI Models Enabling Customer Data Theft\n\nNews5 Apr 2024\n\n1\n\n### Trusted Contributor Plants Sophisticated Backdoor in Critical Open-Source\nLibrary\n\nNews2 Apr 2024\n\n2\n\n### Scammers Impersonate Companies to Steal Cryptocurrency from Job Seekers\n\nNews5 Oct 2023\n\n3\n\n### Women Charged Over Sexually Exploitative Child Modeling Sites\n\nNews19 Aug 2021\n\n4\n\n### China Using AI-Generated Content to Sow Division in US, Microsoft Finds\n\nNews5 Apr 2024\n\n5\n\n### Over 700 Dark Web Ads Offer DDoS Attacks Via IoT in 2023\n\nNews22 Sep 2023\n\n6\n\n### Wiz Discovers Flaws in GenAI Models Enabling Customer Data Theft\n\nNews5 Apr 2024\n\n1\n\n### 17 Billion Personal Records Exposed in Data Breaches in 2023\n\nNews28 Mar 2024\n\n2\n\n### How to Discover the Right AI Cybersecurity Tools for Your Security\nStrategy\n\nNews Feature4 Apr 2024\n\n3\n\n### CISA Launches New Cyber Incident Reporting Rules for US Defense\nContractors\n\nNews29 Mar 2024\n\n4\n\n### LockBit Scrambles After Takedown, Repopulates Leak Site with Old Breaches\n\nNews4 Apr 2024\n\n5\n\n### NHS Trust Confirms Clinical Data Leaked by \u201cRecognized Ransomware Group\u201d\n\nNews27 Mar 2024\n\n6\n\n### Adapting to Tomorrow's Threat Landscape: AI's Role in Cybersecurity and\nSecurity Operations in 2024\n\nWebinar28 Mar 2024\n\n1\n\n### Beyond Passwords: Securing the Digital Age with MFA, 2FA, and Passwordless\nAuthentication\n\nWebinar19 Mar 2024\n\n2\n\n### Bouncing Back: Building Organizational Resilience in the Face of Cyber-\nAttack\n\nWebinar20 Mar 2024\n\n3\n\n### Disinformation Defense: Protecting Businesses from the New Wave of AI-\nPowered Cyber Threats\n\nWebinar20 Mar 2024\n\n4\n\n### Cracking the Culture Code: Building a Cybersecurity-Aware Workforce\n\nWebinar19 Mar 2024\n\n5\n\n### Securing APIs in the Cloud Frontier\n\nWebinar20 Mar 2024\n\n6\n\n### Infosecurity Magazine Spring Online Summit 2024: Day One\n\nOnline Summit09:45 GMT, 19 Mar \u2013 15:00 GMT, 20 Mar 2024\n\n1\n\n### Infosecurity Magazine Spring Online Summit 2024: Day Two\n\nOnline Summit10:45 \u2013 16:00 EDT, 20 Mar 2024\n\n2\n\n### Russia\u2019s Midnight Blizzard Accesses Microsoft Source Code\n\nNews11 Mar 2024\n\n3\n\n### I-Soon GitHub Leak: What Cyber Experts Learned About Chinese Cyber\nEspionage\n\nNews Feature27 Feb 2024\n\n4\n\n### LockBit Takedown: What You Need to Know about Operation Cronos\n\nNews26 Feb 2024\n\n5\n\n### Women in Cybersecurity at Infosecurity Europe 2024\n\nMagazine Event16:00 PDT, 4 Jun 2024\n\n6\n\n## The magazine\n\n  * About Infosecurity\n  * Meet the team\n  * Contact us\n\n## Advertisers\n\n  * Media pack\n\n## Contributors\n\n  * Forward features\n  * Op-ed\n  * Next-gen submission\n\n  * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Reed Exhibitions Ltd.\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Intellectual property statement\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Sitemap\n\nWe use cookies to analyse and improve our service, to improve and personalise\ncontent, advertising and your digital experience.
