Maybe you've also read Falsehoods\nprogrammers believe about geography.\n\nAddressing is a fertile ground for incorrect assumptions, because everyone's\nused to dealing with addresses and 99% of the time they seem so simple. Below\nare some incorrect assumptions I've seen made, or made myself, or had reported\nto me. (If you want to look up an address for a UK postcode or vice-versa to\nconfirm what I'm telling you, try the Royal Mail Postcode Finder)\n\n  * An address will start with, or at least include, a building number.\n\nCounterexample: Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, WC2E 9DD, United\nKingdom.\n\n  * When there is a building number, it will be all-numeric.\n\nCounterexample: 1A Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT\n\n4-5 Bonhill Street, London, EC2A 4BX\n\n  * No buildings are numbered zero\n\nCounterexample: 0 Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT\n\n  * Well, at the very least no buildings have negative numbers\n\nGuy Chisholm provided this counterexample: Minusone Priory Road, Newbury, RG14\n7QS\n\n(none of the databases I've checked render this as -1)\n\n  * We can put those funny numbers into the building name field, as no buildings have both a name and a funny number\n\nCounterexample: Idas Court, 4-6 Princes Road, Hull, HU5 2RD\n\n  * When there's a building name, there won't be a building number (or vice-versa)\n\nCounterexample: Flat 1.4, Ziggurat Building, 60-66 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N\n8QX, United Kingdom\n\n  * A building number will only be used once per street\n\nThe difference between 50 Ammanford Road, Tycroes, Ammanford, SA18 3QJ and 50\nAmmanford Road, Llandybie, Ammanford, SA18 3YF is about 4 miles (Google Maps).\n\n  * When there's line with a number in an address, it's the building number.\n\nCounterexample: Flat 18, Da Vinci House, 44 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8FH,\nUnited Kingdom\n\nYou also get suite numbers, floor numbers, unit numbers, and organisations\nwith numbers in their names.\n\nAdrien Pi\u00e9rard contributes an address from Japan with fifteen digits in six\nseparate numbers (five if you count the zip code as a single number). The\nformat is: 980-0804 (zip code), Miyagi-ken (prefecture) Sendai-shi (city)\nAoba-ku (ward) Kokubuncho (district) 4-10-20 (sub-district-number block-number\nlot-number) Sendai (building name) 401 (flat number).\n\n  * OK, the first line starting with a number then\n\nCounterexample: 3 Store, 311-318 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BN\n\n  * A building will only have one number\n\nBenton Lam offers this address from the Hong Kong Special Administrative\nRegion - it has both a number on its road (14) and in its group of buildings\n(3): 15/F, Cityplaza 3, 14 TaiKoo Wan Road, Island East, HKSAR\n\n  * The number of buildings is the difference between the highest and lowest building numbers\n\nTibor Sch\u00fctz points out building numbers may be skipped - for example, on a\nstreet where even-numbered buildings are on one side, odd numbers on the\nother; multiple buildings sharing the same number (such as where a new house\nhas been built) and buildings with more than one number.\n\nCyrille Ch\u00e9p\u00e9lov and Sami Lehtinen tell me in Antibes, France and rural\nFinland some buildings are numbered based on the distance from the start of\nthe road - such as Longroad 65 for the building 750m from the start of\nlongroad.\n\n  * If the addresses on the left of the road are even, the addresses on the right must be odd\n\nCyrille Ch\u00e9p\u00e9lov points out that in places, Boulevard Th\u00e9ophile Sueur,\nMontreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France has evens-only on both sides. The two\nsides are also in different cities and D\u00e9partements.\n\n  * A building name won't also be a number\n\nBen Tilly reports on Ten Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109 USA - which is not,\nreportedly, the same as 10 Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109 USA.\n\n  * Well, at least you can omit leading zeros\n\nShaun Crampton reports living at 101 Alma St, Apartment 001, Palo Alto - where\napartments 1 and 001 were on different floors.\n\n  * A street with a building A will not also have a building Alpha\n\nDouglas Perreault reports he lived in a block within a condo association; it\nwas a large association, with blocks A through Z then Alpha, Beta, Gamma,\nDelta, and Theta. Mail and deliveries were often misrouted from block Alpha to\nblock A and vice-versa. His address at the time was: 14100 N 46th St., Alpha\n39, Tampa, FL 33613\n\n  * A street name won't include a number\n\n8 Seven Gardens Burgh, WOODBRIDGE, IP13 6SU (pointed out by Raphael Mankin)\n\n  * OK, but numbers in street names are expressed as words, not digits\n\nJan Jongboom reports streets can be numbered in the Netherlands - for example,\nPlein 1944 in Nijmegen.\n\n  * When there's a numbered street and a house number, there will be a separator between them\n\nAnother from Jan Jongboom: Gondel 2695, Lelystad, means area Gondel, street\n26, number 95\n\n  * Street names always end in descriptors like 'street', 'avenue', 'drive', 'square', 'hill' or 'view'\n\nThey don't always - for example: Piccadilly, London, W1J 9PN\n\n  * OK, but when they do have a descriptor there will only be one\n\nA street name can be entirely descriptors: 17 Hill Street, London, W1J 5LJ or\nAvenue Road, Toronto, Ontario.\n\n  * OK, but when they do have a descriptor it will be at the end\n\nFrench addresses use prefix descriptors like 'rue', 'avenue', 'place' and\n'allee'.\n\n  * OK, but if there's a descriptor it'll be at the start or end of the street name.\n\nOr the middle, like 3 Bishops Square Business Park, Hatfield, AL10 9NA\n\n  * OK, but at the very least you wouldn't name a town Street\n\nActually there's a town called Street in Somerset, UK.\n\n  * Street numbers (and building numbers) don't contain fractions\n\nDan, Fred Kroon, David Underwood and Daniel Dickison submitted examples of\nfractional street numbers like 43rd 1\u20442 St, Pittsburgh, PA, and of fractional\nbuilding numbers. These can be written in unicode (43rd 1\u20442 St), as a fraction\nwith a slash (43 1/2) or as a decimal (43.5)\n\nGene Wirchenko reports a fractional building number: 1313 1/2 Railroad Ave\nBellingham WA 98225-4729\n\n  * Street names don't recurr in the same city\n\nHere's a map of the following addresses:\n\n    * High Street, London, W3 6LJ\n    * High Street, London, W5 5DB\n    * High Street, London, N8 7PB\n    * High Street, London, SE25 6EP\n    * High Street, London, E13 0AJ\n    * High Street, London, E17 7LD\n    * High Street, London, NW10 4LX\n    * Islington High Street, London, N1 9TR\n    * Shoreditch High Street, London, E1 6PG\n    * Camden High Street, London, NW1 0JH\n    * Kensington High Street, London, W14 8NL\n    * Lewisham High Street, London, SE13 6AD\n    * High Street Wimbledon, London, SW19 5DX\n    * High Street Wanstead, London, E11 2AJ\n    * High Street Colliers Wood, London, SW19 2AE\n    * High Street North, London, E6 2HJ\n  * But street names don't recurr in close proximity\n\nJulian Fleischer provides an example from Bocholt in Germany showing several\nroads in close proximity all called Up de Welle.\n\n  * An address will be comprised of road names\n\nKirk Kerekes spent several years using an address of the form \"2 mi N then 3\nmi W of Jennings, OK 74038\" which regularly got successful deliveries. Mike\nRiley used to mail the Very Large Array radio telescope at \"50 miles (80 km)\nWest of Socorro, New Mexico, USA\"\n\nSam pointed me to Menomonee Falls where houses are addressed using Milwaukee\nCounty's grid system instead of house numbers - giving addresses like N88\nW16541 Foobar St.\n\nAndy Monat sent the following address example, from a semester abroad program\nat Tulane University : CIAPA, 50 meters north of the Hypermas/Walmart of\nCurridabat, San Jose, Costa Rica. Adrien Pi\u00e9rard and Luke Allardyce point out\nstreet names are seldom used in Japan - instead, districts and blocks and lot\nnumbers are used (more info on the Wikipedia entry for the Japanese addressing\nsystem). A 2002 World Press Review report gave this sample address: From where\nthe Chinese restaurant used to be, two blocks down, half a block toward the\nlake, next door to the house where the yellow car is parked, Managua,\nNicaragua. Shaun Crampton sent an article with more details and examples of\nthe Nicaraguan system. Stig Brautaset pointed out a BBC article about post in\nKabul gives this example: \"Hamid Jaan, behind Darul-Aman palace\". Nathan\nFellman reports similar addressing is used in Nicaragua and Costa Rica.\n\nPaul Puschmann and Tibor Sch\u00fctz pointed out the city of Mannheim in Germany is\nsometimes called Quadratestadt (City of Squares) as the city centre is\narranged in a grid, with blocks assigned a letter (along the north-south axis)\nand a number (along the east-west axis) then buildings numbered by block\nnumber. So an example address at numbers 6 to 13 on block R 5 would be:\nInstitut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache, R 5, 6-13, D-68161 Mannheim\n\nLeoni Lubbinge gives an example of a South African address: Part 84,\nStrydfontein 306 JR, Pretoria which means the 84th plot of the farm\nStrydfontein 306 JR.\n\n  * A road will have a name\n\nPlenty of roads like driveways, onramps and the aisles of carparks don't have\nnames. Some roads in Japan also don't have names, as the prevalent addressing\nsystem works on districts, subdistricts, blocks, lots and lot numbers.\n\nPeter Kenway points out in America some homes are addressed as Rural Routes,\nwhere numbers are allocated to boxes on a route covering multiple roads. For\nexample: Box 1234, R.R. 1, Winthrop, ME 04364.\n\n  * A road will only have one name\n\nMany different roads, from Goswell Road in London to Regent Road in Edinburgh,\nmake up the 410 mile A1. And while there may only be one \"1 Goswell Road\" and\nonly one \"1 Regent Road\" there are multiple buildings numbered 1 on the road\ndesignated A1.\n\nRoads may also be named in multiple languages. For example, in Ireland roads\nmay be named in both English and Irish\n\n  * Addresses will only have one street\n\nThe Royal Mail have what they call a 'dependent street' - for example: 6 Elm\nAvenue, Runcorn Road, Birmingham, B12 8QX, United Kingdom (Runcorn Road is the\nstreet, Elm Avenue is the stubby 'dependent street' and isn't unique within\nthe city. Google Maps )\n\nAnother counterexample: Rogue Hair, 1 Hopton Parade, Streatham High Road,\nLondon, SW16 6EP (Streatham High Road is the street. Hopton Parade is a little\nrow of shops on the road - Google Maps )\n\n  * Addresses will have a street\n\nThe Royal Mail will deliver to certain premises by name, such as farms and\ncottages. Example: Oakland, Fairseat, Sevenoaks, TN15 7LT, United Kingdom\n(Fairseat is the town - this is actually on Vigo Road. Google Maps )\n\n  * An address will include a state in the US sense.\n\nCounterexample: Any address in the United Kingdom.\n\n  * Addresses will have something other than the organisation and city name.\n\nLarge recipients of mail are sometimes addressed by organisation alone - for\nexample: Electoral Reform Society Ltd, London, N1 1RS, United Kingdom\n\n  * An address will have a county\n\nIain Parris and Naath both pointed out that, while many websites ask users for\na county, not all countries use them in addressing. For example, the Royal\nMail stopped using postal counties in 1996.\n\nYves Daoust reports that in Belgium an address only requires a street,\npostcode and city; example: Boulevard Fr\u00e8re Orban, 27, 4000 Li\u00e8ge. Erik\nEngheim reports that in Norway Oslo is a By (city), Tettsted (urban area),\nKommune (municipality) and Fylke (county) but it usually only appears once in\na written address.\n\n  * An address require both a city and a country\n\njzwinck points out Singapore is a city-state, leading to addresses like\nSingapore, Singapore - or even Singapore, Singapore, Singapore if you demand a\ncity, county and country.\n\n  * You can't have two towns cities with the same name in the same country\n\nSure you can - for example the UK has three towns called Newport.\n\nJan Jongboom reports from the Netherlands, where there are two cities called\nEursinge - in the same province!\n\n  * OK, but those cities won't have duplicate street names\n\n    * 10 High Street, Newport, PO30 1SS\n    * 10 High Street, Newport, NP20 1FQ\n    * 10 High Street, Newport, TF10 7AN\n  * An address will have a postcode\n\nRichard Fletcher, Lee Hosty, Paul O'Nolan, Simon Diab, Tony Finn, Donal\nMaccarthy, mark lynch and Donovan all pointed out countries like the Republic\nof Ireland have addresses without postcodes, or only have postcodes in certain\nparts of the country. Danny Angus points out this is also the case in Hong\nKong.\n\nJessica Enders points out the post-paid address of the AEC: Australian\nElectoral Commission, Reply Paid 9867, your capital city\n\n  * The user will know their postal code/zip code.\n\nMost users will, of course, but I've seen incorrect postcodes on corporate\nletterheads! Misreading handwritten postcodes seems like a common one.\n\n  * A single postcode will be larger than a single building\n\nAlthough zip codes in the US usually cover very large areas, Anthony Elizondo\npoints out some buildings have their own zip codes - like the Empire State\nBuilding (10118)\n\nIn the UK, alphanumeric postcodes are typically much more precise than US zip\ncodes.\n\n  * OK, but you don't get multiple postcodes per building\n\nGraham Lee points out DVLA Swansea (that's the whole address), where different\ndepartments are identified by postcode: V5Cs are processed at SA99 1BA,\ndriving licences at SA99 1AB and so on.\n\nMalcolm Gilbert points out this example, with five postcodes for five\ndepartments:\n\n    * London Borough of Enfield, Civic Centre, Silver Street, ENFIELD, EN1 3ES\n    * Returning Officer, London Borough of Enfield, Civic Centre, Silver Street, ENFIELD, EN1 9SA\n    * Edmonton, London Borough of Enfield, Civic Centre, Silver Street, ENFIELD, EN1 9SB\n    * Enfield North, London Borough of Enfield, Civic Centre, Silver Street, ENFIELD, EN1 9SD\n    * Enfield Southgate, London Borough of Enfield, Civic Centre, Silver Street, ENFIELD, EN1 3ZW\n    * But the Enfield council website contact page lists their postcode as EN1 3XY - which the Royal Mail think is a PO Box at the sorting office.\n  * A single postcode will only cover a few tens of addresses / customers\n\nMostly this is reasonable in the UK, but there are certain exceptions. For\nexample CV4 7AL is the postcode of the University of Warwick - one postcode\nfor 6,000 students living on campus, and academics/administrators working on\ncampus.\n\nAlso, if your customers get things delivered to them when they're on holiday,\nlots of customers may have the same holiday parks on their accounts.\n\nSome addresses correspond to 'flexible office spaces' and organisations that\noffer PO Boxes that sound like fancy offices. The Royal Mail lists more than\n90 organisations operating out of Tower 42, 25 Old Broad Street, London, EC2N\n1HQ. Holiday parks and cottages may also appear on many customers' accounts.\n\nVictor Nicollet contributes the example of French postcode 75015, representing\nthe XVth arrondissement of Paris, which covers over 230,000 people.\n\n  * A zip code corresponds to a single city\n\nMike Cohen reports zip code 33334 covers 3 cities: Oakland Park, Wilton\nManors, and Fort Lauderdale, all in Florida.\n\n  * Zip codes don't start with a zero\n\nSome Brazilian zip codes do according to speeder, as do Israeli postcodes for\narmy units. Jessica Enders and Frank Malcolm pointed out postcodes in the\nNorthern Territory of Australia start with 08; for example the postcode for\nthe city Darwin is 0800. Morsillo Lindsay, Thomas Norris and Jerry B. Altzman\npoint out American addresses in the north east have zip codes starting with\nzero, for example Ten Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109, USA; and some zip codes\nstart with two zeros. Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson reports the zip code of Jena in\nGermany is 07737.\n\nAntti Vikman and Johan Myr\u00e9en tell me all postcodes in Helsinki, the capital\nof Finland, all start with two zeroes. Some special codes even start with four\nzeroes (00002 HELSINKI). Andrew Jones reports the initial digits of French\npostcodes are the d\u00e9partements*, and may use a leading zero. Post addressed to\n06130 Grasse is correctly delivered to the town in district 06, Alpes\nMaritimes - but post addressed to 6130 Grasse is first routed to department\n61, Orne. klez reports Italian Codice di Avviamento Postale (CAP) numbers can\nhave a leading zero.\n\n    * Except Corsica - Cyrille Ch\u00e9p\u00e9lov reports it's split into d\u00e9partements 2A and 2B, but the Post Office kept the former single-number 20 (Ajaccio, 20000; Bastia, 20200)\n\n  * Addresses will have a reasonable number of characters - less than 100, say.\n\nNot when organisation and department names can be included in addresses! For\nexample: Department For Environment Food & Rural Affairs (D E F R A), State\nVeterinary Service, Animal Health Office, Hadrian House, Wavell Drive,\nRosehill Industrial Estate, Carlisle, CA1 2TB, United Kingdom\n\nAnother example: The Gynaecology Cancer Research Unit, Department of\nObstetrics & Gynaecology, St. Bartholomews & The Royal School of Medicine &\nDentistry, Charterhouse Square, London, EC1M 6GR, United Kingdom\n\n  * But street names will be reasonably short - certainly less than 50 characters\n\nSusanne Schmidt provides the longest street name in Germany: Bisch\u00f6flich-\nGeistlicher-Rat-Josef-Zinnbauer-Stra\u00dfe in 84130 Dingolfing, Bavaria\n\nGraham Rhind suggests this 89-character street name in Bihac, Bosnia: Aleja\nAlije Izetbegovi\u0107a Prvig Predsjednika Predsjedni\u0161tva Republika Bosna i\nHercegovina\n\n  * Five lines and country will cover all cases.\n\nYou'll need 8 lines and country to deliver to: GB Technical Services, Unit\nW7a, Warwick House, 18 Forge Lane, Minworth Industrial Park, Minworth, Sutton\nColdfield, B76 1AH, United Kingdom\n\n  * Addresses don't contain commas (so I can replace newlines with commas then commas with newlines and get back to where I was)\n\nAddresses can contain organisation names, and organisation names can contain\ncommas. For example: Society of College, National & University Libraries, 102\nEuston Street, London, NW1 2HA\n\n  * But they don't contain commas, brackets, apostrophes, hyphens, ampersands, dots or exclamation marks\n\nSt. Judes & St. Pauls C of E (Va) Primary School, 10 Kingsbury Road, London,\nN1 4AZ\n\n1 Acre View, Bo\u2019ness, EH51 9RQ\n\n1 Highview Terrace, Westward Ho!, Bideford, EX39 1AQ (exclamation mark is\nomitted in some databases)\n\nFlat 1.4, Ziggurat Building, 60-66 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8QX, United\nKingdom\n\nKirkland, Lane, Mathias & Perry, North Muskham Prebend Church Street,\nSouthwell, NG25 0HQ\n\nMark Wallace tells us The Hague in the Netherlands is has multiple official\nnames, one of which is 's-Gravenhage (not a plural, literally a city name\nstarting apostrophe s and with a hyphen)\n\nSignposts for Station Road East, Grantham, NG31 6HX render it as STATION ROAD\n(EAST).\n\nMore generally, addresses can contain organisation names, and organisations\ncan have names like Yahoo! with an exclamation mark. Legislation on company\nsets out the allowable characters for the UK and it permits company names\nincluding ! LTD (company 08209948); @ LTD (company 08209882); $ LTD (company\n08209885) and % LTD (company 04487680) as well as a variety of other names I\ndon't have examples for as the companies house website won't let me search for\nthem.\n\n  * An address will exist in the country's postal service's database\n\nSimon Westcott points out databases are only released periodically, so it's\nnot unusual for new buildings to be omitted.\n\n  * An address in the country's postal service's database will exist\n\nRoyal Mail and Ordnance Survey data can contain demolished buildings, and\nbuildings currently under construction. The Royal Mail even have a database\nproduct called Not Yet Built. Temporary postcodes can even be assigned to\nbuilding sites!\n\n  * The address from the postal service database is sufficient to deliver\n\nChristopher Allen points out that people in new blocks of flats and houseboats\nin boatyards sometimes need to prefix their official address with a boat name\nor flat number.\n\n  * Every address can be expressed in a way that will pass all validators\n\nXaspR8d must have been exasperated by the fact his road is variously known as\n\"S Hwy X\", \"Highway X\" and \"South County Rd X\" - and related a story of being\nunable to buy a product as the only addresses that passed a vendor's address\nvalidation wouldn't pass his bank's address validation and vice-versa.\n\nJon Peterson lives in an apartment community that is divided into Quail Ridge\nCir, Quail Ridge East Lane and Quail Ridge West Lane. Only the USPS and the\ncity electric utility seem to recognize the \"Lane\". Everyone else requires it\nbe shortened to \"Quail Rdg E\" (or W) and reportedly when UPS turns a package\nover to the USPS it gets returned as undeliverable-no such address.\n\nSusannah Fleming lived on the road the Royal Mail call Top O'The Lane,\nBrindle, Chorley, PR6 8PA. She reports representations in different databases\ninclude:\n\n    * Top o' th' Lane\n    * Top o'th' Lane\n    * Top oth Lane\n    * Top o' the Lane\n    * Top of the Lane\n    * Workhouse Lane (a historical name of the road)\n    * Denham Lane (name of the road continuation)\n\n  * Customers will have a fixed address with a fixed location\n\nA developer just a few seats from me recently brought a house boat with the\nintention of using it as her primary residence. Needless to say, boats can\nmove - including between towns and even countries!\n\nfr0sty points out the State of Illinois catch-all approach to addresses: \"IF\nYOU HAVE NO STREET ADDRESS, below describe your home: list the name of\nsubdivision; cross streets; roads; landmarks; mileage and/or neighbors'\nnames.\"\n\nSharon Freas has dealt with systems supporting \"Snowbird\" clients, who\nalternate between addresses with the changing seasons.\n\n  * But written addresses don't change\n\nAddresses can move between counties and administrative districts. For example,\nI used to live in the county Gwent, but that no longer exists. Addresses may\nalso be assigned new postcodes.\n\nSusanne Schmidt points out cities, streets and entire countries were renamed\nin eastern europe - for example, when Lenin fell out of favour as a street\nname. Addresses can be in disputed territories, or even war zones.\n\nDouglas Perreault reports owning a condo that changed address three times;\nfirst it was 14100 N 46th St., Alpha 39, Lutz, FL 33549; then a new post\noffice was built and it became 14100 N 46th St., Alpha 39, Tampa, FL 33612;\nthen the ZIP Code changed giving 14100 N 46th St., Alpha 39, Tampa, FL 33613;\nthen the condo association changed to a less error-prone block naming scheme,\ngiving 14410 Hanging Moss Circle, #101, Tampa, FL 33613.\n\n  * Postal, traditional and administrative counties all line up, right?\n\nAs you can learn from wikipedia's page on postal counties, even when the Royal\nMail used postal counties, they didn't always line up with administrative\ncounties. And of course administrative regions come and go with changes to\nlocal government structures - for example, the county I was born in in no\nlonger exists.\n\n  * Military addresses are just like regular addresses\n\nPeter Bailey points out several countries have special military mail to deal\nwith the complexities of delivering to soldiers deployed to other countries,\nships at sea and similar; and their addresses don't always follow conventional\naddress formats. For example, the address BFPO, BF1 4FB is the address of the\nnavy vessel HMS Example.\n\nEd Schiebel reports the postcodes allocated to Israeli army units roam around\nwith the units.\n\n  * An address corresponds to the recipient's location.\n\nAddresses such as PO boxes are often only as precise as the recipient's city\nor sorting office. Jessica Enders tells me the Australian post service Reply\nPaid addresses (no stamp needed); PO Boxes (Post Office Boxes); GPO Boxes\n(General Post Office Boxes, in the middle of capital cities only); locked\nbags; private bags; parcel lockers; parcel collect; \"Care of Post Office\"; CMA\n(Community Mail Agent); CPA (Community Postal Agent); CMB (Community Mail Bag)\nand Mail Service (MS)!\n\nTibor Sch\u00fctz points out many post offices have novelty handling of mail to\nSanta Claus, even going as far as to allocate special postcodes. For example,\nin Germany: Santa Claus Nordpolen, Julemandes Postkontor, DK-3900 Nuuk; in\nCanada: Santa Claus, North Pole, H0H 0H0; in the UK: Father Christmas, Santa\u2019s\nGrotto, Reindeerland, XM4 5HQ\n\n  * An address can be expressed with a single country\n\nMatthieu Valleton got in touch to point out his address on Kerguelen Island\n(Google Map), a French territory in the Indian Ocean, his address was District\nde Kerguelen (island), Terres Australes et Antarctiques Fran\u00e7aises\n(territory), via la R\u00e9union (indicates where the mail should be routed\nthrough), France (country)\n\n  * Overseas territories aren't (or are) always included in the postal code system\n\nMonty points out that uncommon political hierarchies can lead to uncommon\npostal addresses. For example, the entire of the Falkland Islands shares\npostal code FIQQ 1ZZ. On the other hand, the British Virgin Islands have their\nown postal code system.\n\n  * All addresses with a box number are PO Boxes\n\nDavid Kuder pointed me to a 1990 article: Risks Digest correspondent Tim Kay\nhad problems getting mail sent to his university campus pigeon hole: Timothy\nL. Kay, Box 256-80, Pasadena, CA 91125. Reportedly automatic systems changed\nhis zip code to 91102. David Kuder identified this was because all Pasadena PO\nBoxes were in box 91102.\n\n  * Addresses will be written in ASCII or at least Latin characters\n\nAlastair Houghton reminds us the Greek tax office's address is \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ae 1 &\n\u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2, \u03a4.\u039a. 18346, \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1\n\nWikipedia has a photo of a parcel where a Russian/Cyrillic address was\ndisplayed on a computer with the wrong character encoding, and transcribed\nfrom that. Reportedly a russian postal worker was able to reverse the mapping\nand deliver the parcel.\n\n@shyhoof wrote an poem about an address label with \u00f3 converted, via latin1 and\ntwo rounds of HTML entities, into &AMP;ATILDE;&AMP;SUP3;\n\n  * Addresses will be written in the character set of the destination country\n\nAlastair Houghton points out addresses may be written in the character set of\nthe source country.\n\n  * But people at least use the same character set for the entire address?\n\nInternational mail may specify the country (and possibly other details) in\nboth the source and destination countries' character sets, so it can be read\nby postal workers on both ends.\n\n  * Addresses will be written from most to least specific\n\nAlastair Houghton provided this example of a Japanese address: \u3012100-8994 (zip\ncode), \u6771\u4eac\u90fd (Tokyo-to, i.e. Tokyo prefecture or state) \u4e2d\u592e\u533a (Chuo-ku, i.e. Chuo\nWard) \u516b\u91cd\u6d32\u4e00\u4e01\u76ee (Yaesu 1-chome, i.e. Yaesu district 1st subdistrict) 5\u756a3\u53f7 (block\n5 lot 3), \u6771\u4eac\u4e2d\u592e\u90f5\u4fbf\u5c40 (Tokyo Central Post Office). Thanks to Norman Diamond for\ntelling me which parts of the address are which!\n\n  * OK, but they'll either be in either ascending or descending specificity\n\nErik Engheim and Jan Jongboom report in Norway and the Netherlands the\nbuilding number (within street) comes after the street name, but before the\ntown name.\n\nDouglas Perreault reports units within American condo associations may be\nwritten below the street name. For example: 14100 (position of condo\nassociation on street) N 46th St. (street name), Alpha (block within condo\nassociation) 39 (unit within block), Lutz (city), FL (state) 33549 (zip).\nLikewise, when mailing an individual at a company some people put the person's\nname after the company name, but before the street name.\n\n  * OK, but at least the same address will always be written in the same order\n\nGy\u00f6rgy Farkas tells me Hungarian addresses can be written in different orders\ndepending on how many lines are available. If you write the address on one\nline, it's expressed from less specific to more specific:\n\n{zip} {town}, {street} {buildingNr}.\n\nIf there are more lines available, the address starts with the street, and if\nthe country is specified, it comes after the town name:\n\n{street} {buildingNr}. {zip} {town}, {country}\n\nAnd if there are no set number of lines, like on an envelope, it's a bit\ndifferent again:\n\n{street} {buildingNr}. {town} {zip} {country}\n\nGene Wirchenko tells me in some parts of Canada, suite 123 in building 456 on\nTheStreet would be written: 123 456 TheStreet whereas in other parts the\ncommon formatting is 456 TheStreet #123\n\n  * Building numbers appear before street names\n\nIn some countries this is reversed - such as in the Netherlands. For example,\nPlein 1944 85 D (where Plein 1944 identifies the street, 85 the building and D\nthe flat/apartment).\n\nSami Lehtinen provides this example from Finland: Kornetintie 6 A II krs\n(Kornetintie is the street name, 6 the building number, A the staircase, II\nkrs indicates the second floor.\n\n  * Flat names/numbers names appear before building numbers\n\nToni Cornelissen points out addresses in the The Netherlands, such as:\nVroomstraat 1a Rood, 2021HL Haarlem where Vroomstaat is the street, 1a is the\nbuilding number, and Rood (literally translated as Red) indicates the upper\npart of the building.\n\n  * A building will be within a few hundred meters of a public road\n\nBuildings like farms and country houses can be at the end of a private road or\ndriveway several hundred meters long.\n\n  * An address with a street name is always closer to that street than any other\n\nLots of examples of this. For example: The National Museum of Computing,\nBletchley Park, Sherwood Drive, Bletchley, Milton Keynes, MK3 6EB. 70m from\nRoche Gardens, 346m from Sherwood Drive, but only accessible by entering\nBletchley Park from Sherwood Drive.\n\n  * Real place names won't contain rude words\n\nIt's not just Middlesex and Scunthorpe you have to check for; Gary Gale has\ncompiled a map of rude-sounding place names.\n\n  * A customer will only want reminders mailed to single address\n\nJohn Dye reports that many doctors' offices, dentists and so on are unable to\nmail both of a child's divorced parents.\n\n  * Each person has exactly one address\n\nTibor Sch\u00fctz points out people often have a different home and work address.\n\nThere are other interesting examples in the discussions at Hacker News and\nReddit Programming.\n\nGraham Rhind pointed out the website Practical International Data Management\nwhich contains other edge cases (and has added some of the examples from\nabove).\n\n  * \u2190 Previous\n  * Archive\n  * Next \u2192\n\n#### Published\n\n29 May 2013\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * programming 7\n  * maps 3\n  * addresses 1\n  * edge_cases 2\n\nwebsite@mjt.me.uk \u00b7 Home \u00b7 Archive \u00b7 Tags\n\nJekyll \u00b7Jekyll Bootstrap \u00b7Twitter Bootstrap\n\n", "frontpage": false}
