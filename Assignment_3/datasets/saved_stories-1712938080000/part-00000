And when we're at\nJupiter, just a few light bulbs and some small appliances.\"\n\nThe mission, planning for which began in the late 1990s, is expected to\nconclude around 2034, when Clipper will likely have reached the end of its\nuseful life.\n\nThe probe will then have one final port of call: Jupiter's largest moon,\ndeputy project manager Tim Larson said.\n\n\"After we're done with the science mission, the way we end is by crashing into\none of the other bodies in the Jovian system to dispose of the spacecraft,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Right now, the plan is to go into Ganymede.\"\n\n\u00a9 2024 AFP\n\nCitation: NASA unveils probe bound for Jupiter's possibly life-sustaining moon\n(2024, April 12) retrieved 12 April 2024 from\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-04-nasa-unveils-probe-bound-jupiter.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
