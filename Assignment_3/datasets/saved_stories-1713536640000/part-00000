I believe this is\nconnected to becoming an adult and feeling a bit confused about what to do.\n\n> What should I study?\n>\n> What career path should I take?\n>\n> Where should I live?\n\nThese are all hard questions to answer that leave you in a sort of limbo, and\nthere\u2019s a high chance you\u2019ll start procrastinating.\n\nThat happens naturally to many people at a young age, and the important thing\nis not to get used to it.\n\nI can\u2019t count how much time I wasted procrastinating in my early career.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?\n\n  * Understand how procrastination works; as they say, know your enemy. Today there\u2019s a lot of literature you can easily access.\n\n  * Use SMART goals to define what I wanted to achieve.\n\n  * Use my calendar to time-box my day and make sure to spend at least half of it focused on my goals.\n\n###\n\nAvoid Competition\n\nI was always a very competitive person, and especially at the beginning of my\ncareer in engineering, this gave me some headaches. I remember I was very\nfrustrated when I saw people who were better than me at doing something\nrelated to my job.\n\nWhile this pushed me to do better on one side, on the other hand, it also\ncaused a lot of unnecessary stress and sometimes even friction with these\npeople.\n\nToday, I tend to avoid competition in favor of collaboration, and this is what\nI also teach my teams.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?\n\n  * Focus more on taking others as examples and not as challenges.\n\n  * Collaborate more with others instead of competing with them.\n\n  * Always surround yourself with people who know more than you do.\n\n###\n\nEstablish Journaling Habits\n\nI've already written a lot about journaling, and it\u2019s something today I\ncouldn\u2019t live without.\n\nBut early in my career, I was one of those who were just head-down into their\njob, confident of remembering everything and convinced that writing was\nuseless.\n\nWhile note-taking and journaling are habits that you can learn at an older\nage, there are two caveats:\n\n  * As with every habit, it\u2019s much harder to get used to it in adult age.\n\n  * You lose years of history that could be useful for future reflections.\n\nI understood the power of these habits just in recent years, and it took a lot\nof effort to establish them.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?\n\n  * Learn more about note-taking and go beyond what I learned about this topic at school, where they rarely teach it to you the right way.\n\n  * Start a journal and keep track of my thoughts, projects, everything.\n\n  * Choose one tool and stick to it (I can\u2019t count how many note-taking apps I've changed).\n\n##\n\n\ud83d\udcda Learning and Education\n\nSchool and learning are interesting chapters of my life.\n\nI\u2019m curious by nature, and my curiosity pushed me to explore many different\nfields, not always related to the engineering career path.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t regret this trait of mine, which made me the generalist I\u2019m\ntoday, if I were to go back, I\u2019d probably try to channel my curiosity into a\nmore focused trajectory.\n\n###\n\nChoose your Education\n\nI always had a difficult relationship with school.\n\nI never repeated a year in high school, but it was a struggle to finish, and\nthen I started university mostly because my parents wanted me to. I changed\nuniversities four times, took about 20 exams in total, and continued to pay\nthe annual university fees for several years before finally quitting.\n\nAll this while I was already working as a systems engineer for major Italian\ntelecommunication companies.\n\nEven though nothing I learned at university was directly useful for my career,\nI was afraid to quit due to pressure from my parents and the fact that my\nfriends were almost all graduating.\n\nThis isn't to say that school or university isn't important, but especially\ntoday, when you can learn almost anything online, traditional education isn't\nthe only option for pursuing a career in IT engineering.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?\n\n  * Focus more on my own future rather than on what others think.\n\n  * Choose a clear direction\u2014whether that be pursuing education or committing to a full-time job. Although it\u2019s possible to do both, focusing on one at a time is much simpler and often more effective.\n\n###\n\nRead More\n\nI\u2019m a very practical person who loves to learn through experimentation and\nfailure. While there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with this approach, it was the\nreason I never developed a strong and consistent reading habit.\n\nUntil my 30s, I believed that reading about the experiences of others was\nunnecessary, and that the only true way to learn was through firsthand\nexperience. Only in recent years have I begun to read and realized how wrong I\nwas.\n\nReading is not only a great way to learn new things, but it also helps you to\ndevelop critical thinking skills.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?\n\n  * Force myself to read books until I developed a habit.\n\n  * Choose books that delve into the stories and thoughts of others, as well as behavioral books, rather than focusing only on technical ones.\n\n##\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udcbc Career Path\n\nI previously wrote about my career journey and how I landed in my current role\nat Namecheap. A\n\nlthough my path over the last 10-15 years has been relatively consistent, I\nspent the first decade of my career with no clear idea of what to do.\n\nThis is probably one of the things I\u2019d try to change if I could go back.\n\n###\n\nDefine a Clear Path\n\nWhile in the early years of everyone\u2019s career, it\u2019s probably normal not to\nhave a clear idea of where you want to end up, having nothing at all made me\nwaste a lot of time.\n\nBefore sitting down and defining my career path, which brought me to where I\nam today, I went through system engineering, security, product management,\ndesign, freelancing, and entrepreneurship.\n\nWhile all these switches made me acquire a lot of different skills, if I could\ngo back, I\u2019d probably follow a more structured and deliberate approach.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?\n\n  * Set clear short-term and long-term career goals.\n\n  * Regularly evaluate my progress and adjust my career path as needed.\n\n  * Seek advice from experienced professionals to help clarify my direction.\n\n###\n\nCode More\n\nI had my first computer (a C64) when I was 13, but at least in the first part\nof my career, I often saw coding as something too hard for me, and this made\nme focus mostly on the system engineering side.\n\nOnly in recent years have I started coding more seriously and understood that\nit\u2019s complementary to systems engineering, so worth learning, even if you\ndon\u2019t want to follow the developer\u2019s path.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?\n\n  * Dedicate specific time to coding to strengthen my skills.\n\n  * Participate in coding challenges and open-source projects.\n\n  * Collaborate with software developers to gain insights and practical knowledge.\n\n##\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Public Exposure\n\nIf you want to advance in your career, leaving your comfort zone is mandatory,\nand this often means becoming publicly exposed.\n\nIt could be within your team, your company, or a wider community, but exposing\nyour thoughts and ideas and being ready to be judged in public is an\nincredible booster.\n\n###\n\nPublic Speaking\n\nI\u2019m an introvert, and I've always disliked being on stage.\n\nEarly in my career, I avoided public speaking whenever possible, and even\ntoday, while I have improved somewhat, it remains one of my biggest\nweaknesses. I believe this fear of the stage not only precluded some\nopportunities in my career but also prevented me from validating ideas and\nthoughts.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?\n\n  * Join a local theater club to improve my public speaking skills or get some coaching.\n\n  * Volunteer for speaking opportunities at work and conferences.\n\n  * Practice regularly with peers to build confidence.\n\n###\n\nWriting in Public\n\nI've lost count of how many blogs I've started in my life. I was great at\nsetting up the website but would then leave it empty or with just the classic\n'Hello World' article.\n\nThe biggest blocker was the fear of being judged\u2014for my English, for my ideas,\nand so on\u2014and the impact this could have on my career. I always had a good\nexcuse.\n\nIt goes without saying that I was wrong and this newsletter that you are\nreading is the perfect example.\n\nWriting in public is a great way to:\n\n  * Solidify concepts that you learn and deliver your ideas.\n\n  * Get feedback about what you think.\n\n  * Step out of your comfort zone.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?\n\n  * Start a blog or a newsletter and commit to maintaining it.\n\n  * Write consistently about my career journey, sharing insights and learnings.\n\n##\n\n\u2696\ufe0f Work-Life Balance\n\nAchieving a healthy work-life balance is essential for long-term success and\nwell-being.\n\nRegrettably, in the middle of my career, I neglected this aspect of my life in\npursuit of career advancement.\n\nI often prioritized work at the expense of personal time.\n\nLooking back, I would have probably adopted a more balanced approach, setting\nclear boundaries between work and personal life.\n\n###\n\nDon\u2019t go All-In\n\nIn the competitive world of engineering, it's tempting to go all-in and\ndedicate every waking hour to work. However, I've learned the hard way that\nthis approach is unsustainable in the long run and establishes a wrong habit\nthat it\u2019s hard to eradicate when you are older.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?\n\n  * Enforce strict boundaries between work and personal life.\n\n  * Learn to decline tasks that could put these boundaries at risk.\n\n###\n\nEstablish Workout Habits\n\nI always loved doing sports and I dedicated a lot of time to them during the\nearly stages of my career, but then, after going all-in with my career, I\nstopped.\n\nToday I find myself still struggling in building a consistent workout habit\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?\n\n  * Make physical activity something mandatory into my daily schedule.\n\n  * Choose enjoyable and sustainable forms of exercise to ensure regularity.\n\n  * Set and monitor fitness goals.\n\n##\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Mentorship and Networking\n\nFor the same reasons I often struggled with public exposure early in my\ncareer, networking and relying on others' mentorship were also challenges.\n\nEven though I participated in many events and met numerous people in my field,\nI believe I could have done much better, especially in terms of maintaining\nthese relationships.\n\n###\n\nFind Mentors, Rely on Coaches\n\nAs I have previously written, I enjoy learning through my own failures and\nconsider it a valuable learning method. However, similar to my experiences\nwith reading books, I now realized how beneficial it can be to have a mentor\nor rely on coaches, especially early in your career.\n\nIt's not about having someone to tell you what to do; it\u2019s about gaining\ndifferent perspectives and comparing your approaches with those used by other\nsuccessful people. This not only saves time but also significantly boosts your\npersonal growth.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?\n\n  * Find a mentor who could have guided me through my journey.\n\n  * Invest on coaching during complex situations or critical career transitions.\n\n###\n\nNetwork More\n\nBuilding a broad network can open doors to countless opportunities and\ninsights.\n\nI often underestimated the power of networking in unlocking potential career\npaths and collaborations.\n\nWhat I particularly lacked was consistency and growing relationships.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?\n\n  * Attend more events and be less scared of approaching people.\n\n  * Curate my relationships over time.\n\n##\n\n\ud83c\udfc1 TL;DR\n\nI believe that looking back at your career is always a useful exercise, as it\nwas for me while writing this article.\n\nThe most important thing is to do this without feeling frustrated about what\nyou could have done better, and instead focus on how you can improve things\ngoing forward.\n\nTo sum up what I would do better if I were to start my engineering career\ntoday:\n\n  * \ud83d\udd52 Procrastination Management: understand procrastination better, use SMART goals, and time-box my days to focus on specific goals.\n\n  * \ud83e\udd1d Avoid Competition: emphasize collaboration over competition, take examples from others constructively, and surround myself with more knowledgeable people.\n\n  * \ud83d\udcd3 Journaling and Note-Taking: start journaling early in my career and learn effective note-taking, using one consistent tool.\n\n  * \ud83c\udf93 Education Choices: focus more on my own goals instead of others\u2019 expectations, and choose a clear educational or career path.\n\n  * \ud83d\udcda Reading Habits: force myself to develop a reading habit early, focusing on diverse books.\n\n  * \ud83e\udded Career Path Definition: set clear career goals, regularly evaluate progress, and seek guidance from experienced professionals.\n\n  * \ud83d\udcbb Coding Practice: allocate specific times for coding, participate in coding challenges, and collaborate with developers.\n\n  * \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Public Speaking: join a theater club or get coaching, volunteer for speaking opportunities, and practice regularly.\n\n  * \u270d\ufe0f Writing Publicly: start and maintain a blog or newsletter in the early stages of my career, and write consistently about it.\n\n  * \u2696\ufe0f Work-Life Balance: set firm boundaries between work and personal life, and learn to decline tasks that put these boundaries at risk.\n\n  * \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Physical Fitness: integrate physical activity into my daily schedule, choose the right activities, and set fitness goals.\n\n  * \ud83c\udf10 Mentorship and Networking: seek mentors and coaches early in my career, network actively, and nurture professional relationships consistently.\n\n##\n\n\ud83d\udce2 Weekly Shoutouts\n\n  * Preparing for behavioral interviews by\n\nBhavana\n\n  * How to recognize the potential in engineers by\n\nGregor Ojstersek\n\n  * 5 Mistakes that New Tech Leads Make by\n\nRaviraj Achar\n\n  * How to share your point of view by\n\nWes Kao\n\n  * 90 Days In: Key Lessons from My Solopreneur Journey by\n\nSergio Visinoni\n\n##\n\n\u270c\ufe0f That\u2019s all folks\n\nThat's all for today!
