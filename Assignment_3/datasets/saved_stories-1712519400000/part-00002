Maybe you won\u2019t be able to travel to an area in the path\nof totality. Maybe your view will be obscured by clouds. Never fear: if all\nelse fails, you can watch the rare spectacle online, thanks to a handful of\nlivestreams designed to share the eclipse with viewers around the globe.\n\nFirst up, check out Scientific American\u2019s own livestreams. Throughout the\nweekend and the day of the eclipse, we\u2019ll have a team live on the ground in\nTexas that will hang out with top-tier eclipse chasers and share the\nexperience.\n\nOn April 6, at 12 P.M. EDT, join us on Instagram or TikTok for a broadcast\nwith our senior space and physics editor Clara Moskowitz and Kate Russo, a\npsychologist and author who has seen 13 total solar eclipses in the past 20\nyears. Russo will be answering questions about the eclipse from viewers in the\nlivestream chats, so be sure to tune in!\n\nThen on April 8, at 1:15 P.M. EDT, we\u2019ll be back on Instagram and YouTube for\nthe big day! Scientific American staffers will give you the on-the-ground\nexperience of chasing totality, with close-ups of the sun and expert\ncommentary.\n\nWe also hope to offer a view of the eclipse that you can\u2019t catch from anywhere\non the ground, even with a \u201cperfect location\u201d and clear skies: a team of\nresearchers will be using two jets from NASA\u2019s WB-57 High Altitude Research\nProgram that were converted into high-flying telescopes to chase the eclipse\nfor science.\n\nWhen the team made its first eclipse flight during 2017\u2019s coast-to-coast\nspectacle, the scientists produced high-resolution images of the sun\u2019s outer\natmosphere, or corona, in a wavelength of light in which it had never been\ncaptured before. By flying along the path of totality, the researchers also\nstretched their view of this total solar eclipse to about seven and a half\nminutes\u2014despite the fact that no place on Earth experienced totality for\nlonger than two minutes and 42 seconds.\n\n## Curated by Our Editors\n\n  * ### How the 2024 Eclipse Will Explain the Sun\u2019s Ring of Fire\n\nRebecca Boyle\n\n  * ### See What the Solar Eclipse Will Look Like across Most of the U.S.\n\nKatie Peek\n\n  * ### Here Are the Best Places to View the 2024 Total Solar Eclipse\n\nKatie Peek\n\n  * ### Why 2024's Total Solar Eclipse Will Be So Special\n\nMeghan Bartels\n\nThis spring\u2019s eclipse is even more promising because it will last up to four\nminutes and 28 seconds on the ground. In the jet-based observation effort, the\nresearchers hope to stretch that to eight minutes aloft. And during their\nflight this eclipse, the planes will carry upgraded instruments. The jets will\nalso be equipped with new experiments, including one used to study material\nleaving the sun, such as the blobs of plasma and magnetic field dubbed coronal\nmass ejections and the steady stream of charged particles known as the solar\nwind.\n\nOur broadcast of views of the eclipse will have plenty of company. Check out\nthese other options for watching the event on April 8\u2014without needing to worry\nabout protecting your eyes with eclipse glasses.\n\nKeep in mind that the partial eclipse will begin over the Pacific Ocean at\n12:27 P.M. EDT and will make landfall over Sinaloa, Mexico, about half an hour\nlater. Totality will begin there at 2:07 P.M. EDT and will reach Texas 20\nminutes later. It will end over the Canadian island of Newfoundland at 3:46\nP.M. EDT. The partial eclipse will also end over Newfoundland at 4:48 P.M.\nEDT.\n\n## NASA\n\nNASA is offering a handful of webcasts for the 2024 eclipse, including\nversions with English- and Spanish-language commentary and telescope feeds\nfrom across North America. The agency will also be presenting broadcast of\nthree sounding rockets that will launch from Virginia during the eclipse to\nstudy how the atmosphere responds to the phenomenon.\n\n## NSF\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) will also broadcast the eclipse,\nbeginning at 1:55 P.M. EDT on April 8. During the event, NSF researchers will\ntalk about the science of the sun and the agency\u2019s Daniel K. Inouye Solar\nTelescope in Hawaii, which is the largest solar telescope on Earth.\n\n## Additional webcasts\n\n  * Time and Date will livestream the total solar eclipse beginning at 12:30 P.M. EDT\n\n  * Lowell Observatory in Arizona will broadcast the view from Waco, Tex.\n\n  * The Exploratorium in California will livestream in both English and Spanish, with views from Junction, Tex., and Torre\u00f3n, Mexico.\n\n  * The McDonald Observatory in Texas will broadcast the eclipse from three locations across the state, including views from both telescopes and on-site cameras, beginning at 1 P.M. EDT.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Until April 8, this article will be periodically updated with\nadditional content as it becomes available.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nMeghan Bartels is a science journalist based in New York City.
