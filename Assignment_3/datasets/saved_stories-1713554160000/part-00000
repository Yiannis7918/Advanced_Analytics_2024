Alan Turing proposed the\nTuring test, which turns out, I think, to be somewhat incorrect. It basically\nsays if it can fool you into thinking it's a human, then it's good enough. The\nproblem is the definition of you. So usually people who come back breathless\nsaying we've invented AGI have just failed the Turing test from the other side\nthemselves. So really an AGI, like a human, would be capable of unbounded\ncreativity. It would be a universal explainer. So what is creativity? Very\nhard to define. It is the growth of new knowledge that has not yet been\ndiscovered. So an AGI would have to make substantial contributions to new\nknowledge through creative solutions, not just through exhaustively exploring\nthe search space, but actually coming up with new problems and solving them.\nThat's my closest thing to a definition, but it's not a great one.\n\nBrendan Weinstein 1h\n\nI would say, A, that's a great one. I think that's a pretty great definition,\nor at least view, as to what some of the requirements for AGI are. So, I'll\nstart with that. Secondly, that hilarious way to view that Turing test of an\nAGI, as if you've actually been fooled by it, then you yourself have failed\nthe Turing test. Kind of just was like an eye-opener right there for me on\nthat.\n\n...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
