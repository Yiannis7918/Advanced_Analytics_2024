The law requires that\nmanufacturers that do business in the state provide users with easy and\naffordable access to tools, manuals, and parts. It also cracks down on\npractices like \u201cparts pairing,\u201d which often uses software locks to block use\nof third-party parts and assemblages.\n\nIt\u2019s arguably the toughest state right to repair law yet. And it almost didn\u2019t\npass thanks to Apple, which (as it has in other states) lobbied to kill the\nbill, falsely claiming it was a threat to user safety and security.\n\nLast week, The Washington Post proudly declared that Apple was slightly\nreversing some long-standing restrictions on repair and accessibility:\n\n> \u201cApple told The Washington Post it is easing a key restriction on iPhone\n> repairs. Starting this fall, owners of an iPhone 15 or newer will be able to\n> get their broken devices fixed with used parts \u2014 including screens,\n> batteries and cameras \u2014 without any change in functionality.\u201d\n\nNotice this isn\u2019t a full reversal of Apple\u2019s restrictions, which (despite what\nit often claims) are designed to monopolize repair and accelerate the sales of\nnew phones. And it takes the Washington Post until the seventeenth paragraph\nto inform readers that the changes are thanks in large part to Oregon\u2019s new\nlaw.\n\nAnd again, the Post never really informs the reader clearly that Apple lobbied\nto have the law killed. Or really properly frames the impact Apple\u2019s\nrestrictions have long had on the environment, consumer rights and costs, or\nthe small independent repair shops Apple has a history of bullying. But it\ndoes let Apple falsely claim, without correction, that the law is a threat to\nconsumer privacy:\n\n> \u201cNeither Ternus nor Apple spokespeople commented on what changes may have to\n> be made to abide by Oregon law, but the company said in an earlier statement\n> that the bill\u2019s language \u201cintroduces the possibility that Apple would be\n> required to allow unknown, non-secure third-party Face ID or Touch ID\n> modules to unlock\u201d a user\u2019s personal information.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just scare mongering. You can read in detail over at iFixit how \u201cparts\npairing\u201d actually works and how it\u2019s harmful. Apple (like John Deere and every\nother company angry that their repair monopolies are being dismantled) loves\nto pretend their interest here is solely in user safety. Their interest is in\nnew phone sales and maintaining a profitable monopoly over repair.\n\nApple\u2019s whole pivot is framed by the Post, which seems simply thrilled to even\nhave access to an Apple engineering VP, as something Apple just came up with\none day because it\u2019s just that forward-thinking and courteous. It\u2019s another\nexample of how Apple\u2019s widely proclaimed \u201c180 on right to repair\u201d is more of a\ndrunken 45 degree begrudging and overdue waddle, propped up by a lazy press.\n\nFiled Under: consumer rights, independent repair shops, iphone, oregon, parts\npairing, phones, right to repair, wireless Companies: apple\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * Biden's New Net Neutrality Rules Don't Prevent Anti-Competitive \"Fast Lanes\"\n  * 30 States Considering 'Right To Repair' Reforms in 2024\n  * AT&T's Being Weirdly Cagey About A Major Data Breach Impacting 73 Million AT&T Users\n  * Auto, Tech Industries Falsely Claim 'Right To Repair' Reforms Are A Threat To National Security\n  * Senator Wyden Reminds White House Feckless Regulators Have Resulted In Pathetic Security On U.S. Wireless Networks\n\n## Add Your Comment Cancel reply\n\nUK Prosecutors Apologize For Pursuing BS Charges Against A Photographer\n\nApple Praised For Repair Reforms Only Made Possible By New Oregon Law It Tried\nTo Kill\n\nFollow Techdirt\n\n### Techdirt Daily Newsletter\n\nA weekly news podcast from Mike Masnick & Ben Whitelaw\n\nSubscribe now to Ctrl-Alt-Speech \u00bb\n\nEssential Reading\n\n#### The Techdirt Greenhouse\n\nRead the latest posts:\n\n  * Winding Down Our Latest Greenhouse Panel: The Lessons Learned From SOPA/PIPA\n  * From The Revolt Against SOPA To The EU's Upload Filters\n  * Did We Miss Our Best Chance At Regulating The Internet?\n\nRead All \u00bb\n\n#### Trending Posts\n\n  * Sextortion Is A Real & Serious Criminal Issue; Blaming Section 230 For It Is Not\n  * Biden's New Net Neutrality Rules Don't Prevent Anti-Competitive \"Fast Lanes\"\n  * UK Prosecutors Apologize For Pursuing BS Charges Against A Photographer\n\nTechdirt Deals\n\nBuy Now\n\n$150.00\n\nHushed Private Phone Line: Lifetime Virtual Number Subscription\n\nTechdirt Insider Discord\n\nThe latest chatter on the Techdirt Insider Discord channel...\n\n  * John Roddy: Didn't even occur to me that you'd be able to *see* that during the eclipse.\n  * Because the corona is where all of that really shows.\n  * Also spaceweather.gov\n  * Not enough government websites have a chart on their homepage that shows real-time updates on the current measured proton flux.\n  * mildconcern: fantastic, I'm glad you got to see it too.\n  * And yes they were three solar flares going, one of which was big enough to be seen by the naked eye\n  * only two small sun spots though\n  * John Roddy: No, that's one *gigantic* sun spot.\n  * Mike Masnick: the weirdest thing, though, was we had no traffic at all. we found a small town in texas that was a bit off the beaten path, but looked like the weather would cooperate, and we drove 75 miles from our hotel to it, saw no traffic. was able to park easily, even grabbed a nice picnic table in a gazebo. soon after we got there, the park started to fill up, but it never got *crowded*. and then afterwards, we drove back and hit no traffic on the way back either. the only \"line\" we ran into was when stopped at a pie shop on our way back to get some pie to celebrate\n  * mildconcern: I think a lot of the real fanatics ditched going to Texas all together\n  * a fair few folks in the park I was at had plans to be there and then switched up at the last minute with the forecasts to come to New England instead\n  * The town I was in moved their location from the smaller park downtown to this bigger one just two days before the event because of the same factors\n  * Mike Masnick: like absolutely nothing has been crowded (other than the pie stand). pickup line for rental car was non existent. no traffic to the hotel. hotel did not seem crowded at all. everything has been smooth sailing.\n  * mildconcern: The second biggest cheer of the day (after totality) happened when a truck arrived with six more porta potties to help alleviate the hour long line\n  * But it was fun having a crowd. I brought my telescope which made me popular, and it was great letting other people look through it\n  * John Roddy: It was so overcast for me that I legit couldn't even see clouds.\n  * mildconcern: I wasn't really aiming to take pictures primarily but I did get a few\n  * John Roddy: Just a perfectly homogenous gray.\n  * mildconcern: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo...\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo_1bvI0S/?igsh=cW85dnc5czF4Zzg4\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n  * deadspatula: Fascinatingly, the big advancement has been in better dosing, not simply the size of components. The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over. That certainly has helped the field of astronomical detection quite a bit.\n  * Digital sensors that had laughable resolution used to cost a fortune in the 1990s when they started to come out. And now you can get miracle devices for far less.\n  * John Roddy: Cell phone stuff is all in the microwave range.\n  * That's most useful for detecting the cosmic microwave background, which is probably the closest thing to a natural encyclopedia we're ever going to get.\n  * mildconcern: phone cameras also do sense visual light\n  * John Roddy: I feel like everyone I tell this to is hearing it for the first time, but...\n  * I *thought* it was common knowledge that your phone camera is pretty good at seeing infrared too.\n  * It's a really quick and easy way to check if a remote control is working.\n  * Infrared LEDs *will* be visible through the sensor.\n  * mildconcern: Oh yeah I knew that, I was just being a wiseass\n  * it's not hugely far in the infrared spectrum\n  * can't use it as a heat detector or something. Just a smidge.\n  * but I'm mostly saying in terms of astronomy applications. The overall success in designing sensors and detectors in smaller scales has hugely helped anyway\n  * no matter the wavelengths\n  * John Roddy: Yeah, the interesting stuff requires some pretty intense tech.\n  * Almost everything glows in the infrared spectrum, after all.\n  * mildconcern: It's a big part of why they stuck the JWT in space\n  * since it's mostly working in that range\n  * John Roddy: That's only half the story\n  * Spritzer needed some pretty extreme shielding too.\n  * Except the tech wasn't *quite* ready to make the active cooling reliable enough.\n  * A lot of people think of \"cold\" in terms of what chilly weather feels like on earth.\n  * The cold air sucks the heat right out of you.\n  * But space doesn't have that air.\n  * So despite space being extremely cold, it's actually really hard to cool things down out there.\n  * The reason the space shuttle always had the bay doors open in orbit is because that's where the radiators were.\n  * mildconcern: yeah. but the IR wavelengfths that JWT are detecting can't even get through at all even in Earth orbit\n  * so that's why it's out at the Lagrange Point\n  * Despite the \"can't fuck this one up and fix it later\" nature of that as opposed to Hubble\n  * John Roddy: It's not even *at* the Lagrange point\n  * It's in an orbit around it\n  * Samuel Abram: I took a screencap of a thread on facebook, to illustrate the necessity of checkmarks as verification and not a marker of a paid status.\n  * Unfortunately, I can't upload it here\n  * [link]\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17P1ICo5rwQcW4dnkY8KSX8XzdIXoSQZN/view?usp=drive_link\n\n  * John Roddy: Wow. I legit didn't even realize Lowery was still alive.\n  * He was a grumpy old man last time I encountered him years and years ago, after all.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yes, but he's just asking people to be more \"genuinely empathetic\" like the time he suggested I should get cancer and die in a fire.\n  * John Roddy: I don't know. His decision to back up the guy who compared Brian to Hitler kinda seems to undermine that a bit.\n  * mildconcern: \"Following that were screenshots of tweets (or whatever the fuck)\".

Especially as I see the enshittification of Google as (finally) a window of opportunity for others to step in\n  * John Roddy: Cloud powered AI cryptocurrency\n  * mildconcern: Yeah Google is so much easier to switch away from than a social network.\n  * I've been using Kagi for months now and haven't looked back. I tried DuckDuckGo and found that I often had to try Google when it failed. I haven't had to do the same with Kagi.\n  * Mike Masnick: kagi has been good for me too...\n  * Samuel Abram: It's just that Kagi costs money and google doesn't\n  * BentFranklin: That sounds great actually, considering what free gets you these days. Maybe someone can get Kagi added to this: [link]\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/wiki/index\n\n  * mildconcern: I found after trying it for a trial that it saved me more than enough in time to make up for the ten bucks a month.\n  * Worst comes to worse I'll just stop supporting those Techdirt cranks. *grins*\n  * Samuel Abram: That\u2019s fair\n  * Though if I were you, I\u2019d _never_ stop supporting these Techdirt cranks. Quality journalism is worth paying for.\n  * John Roddy: The post of Paxton complaining about the community note being wrong now has its own community note explaining how his explanation of it being wrong is wrong.\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah. I had sent that to @Tim Cushing earlier to check out. Hilarious.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder if Paxton'll retaliate against Elon and make him keep shopping for a state to reincorporate Tesla in\n  * John Roddy: Also I'm banned from submitting any community notes, apparently.\n  * As is anyone else who ever said the word \"cis\" in any context.\n  * candescence: I swear, Elon is the peak example of white male fragility\n  * Samuel Abram: So I guess you could never talk about Transalpine Gaul and [redacted]alpine Gaul, right?\n  * BentFranklin: ...or be a chemist\n  * mildconcern: or the loose trade alliance of former USSR republics\n\nBecome an Insider!\n\nRecent Stories\n\n## Friday  \n  \n---  \n05:26| Apple Praised For Repair Reforms Only Made Possible By New Oregon Law\nIt Tried To Kill (0)  \n  \n## Thursday  \n  \n20:45| UK Prosecutors Apologize For Pursuing BS Charges Against A Photographer\n(12)  \n15:32| Palworld Creator Loves That Others Are Trying To Clone The Game (12)  \n13:02| Sextortion Is A Real & Serious Criminal Issue; Blaming Section 230 For\nIt Is Not (25)  \n11:02| Cops Claim Body Cam Footage Of Wrong Address Raid Would Be 'Dangerous'\nTo Release To General Public (37)  \n10:57| Daily Deal: The Complete Cisco Training Bundle (0)  \n09:24| No, TikTok Is Not \u2018Programmable Fentanyl.'
