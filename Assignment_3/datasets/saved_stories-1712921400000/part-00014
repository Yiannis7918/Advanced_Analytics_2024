Then He Disappeared\n\nFaruk \u00d6zer just started a 11,196-year prison sentence. Did he almost get away\nwith the biggest heist in Turkey\u2019s history, or was it all just a big\nmisunderstanding?\n\nJenna Scatena\n\nApr 2, 2024 6:00 AM\n\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIR\n\nFaruk Fatih \u00d6zer stood in front of a passport control officer at Istanbul\nAirport, a line of impatient travelers queuing behind him. He pulled his face\nmask below his chin for the security camera. Surely he was nervous. The\n27-year-old had unruly black hair, a boy-band face, and a patchy beard.\nNormally he overcompensated for his callow features by dressing in a pressed\nthree-piece suit. But this spring day he wore black trainers and a navy-blue\nsweater hastily pulled over a white polo shirt, as if he had dressed in a\ndash. A small backpack was slung over his right shoulder. He looked like\nsomeone who could have been going on a last-minute day trip\u2014or someone\nplanning to never come back. At 5:57 pm on April 20, 2021, the guard stamped\nhis Turkish passport and \u00d6zer shuffled through the crowd to Gate C, a flash\ndrive containing a rumored $2 billion in crypto stashed in his belongings.\n\nAfter \u00d6zer\u2019s plane reached Tirana, Albania, at 9:24 that night, he checked\ninto the Mondial, a popular 4-star business hotel in the capital\u2019s commercial\ndistrict. A couple of days later, he looked at his social media accounts. A\nmob was very angry with him: Customers couldn\u2019t access their money on the\nexchange Thodex, where he was founder and CEO, and people were accusing him of\nabsconding with their funds.\n\n\u00d6zer posted a public letter to his company\u2019s website and his social accounts.\n\u201cI feel compelled to make this statement in order to respond urgently to these\nallegations,\u201d he wrote. The accusations weren\u2019t true, he said. Thodex\u2014which\nhad nearly half a million investors and $500 million in daily trade volume\u2014was\ninvestigating what \u00d6zer claimed was a suspected cyberattack that caused \u201can\nabnormal fluctuation in the company account.\u201d Assets would be frozen for five\ndays while Thodex resolved the issue. This was terribly bad timing for the big\nbusiness deal he said he was en route to make: selling the company, or so he\nhad told some employees and his brother and sister before he left. All would\nbe made right. \u201cThere will be no victims,\u201d he promised. \u201cI personally declare\nthat I will return to Turkey within a few days and ensure that the facts are\nrevealed in cooperation with judicial authorities and that I will do my best\nto prevent users from suffering.\u201d Of course, there was this possibility too:\nHe was in the midst of pulling off the biggest heist in Turkey\u2019s history.\n\nPHOTOGRAPH: GETTY IMAGES\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

Law\nenforcement arrested 62 people, including Thodex employees at all levels of\nthe company\u2014and \u00d6zer\u2019s older brother and sister, G\u00fcven and Serap. Interpol\nissued a red notice, a request for law enforcement worldwide to find and\n\u201cprovisionally arrest\u201d \u00d6zer pending his extradition to Turkey. Search teams\ndeployed across Albania, Montenegro, Kosovo, and North Macedonia. There were\nreported sightings of the dark-haired young man across Tirana, rumors that he\nhad gone to a poultry farm, that an executive from the Albanian football\nleague was sheltering him. Soon, the Albanian police arrested people accused\nof aiding and abetting him. But no one seemed to know exactly where \u00d6zer was.\n\nBackgammon caf\u00e9s, where old men have been drinking tea and talking politics\nfor centuries, buzzed with crypto gossip.\n\n\u00d6zer had vanished at a particularly precarious time in crypto\u2019s annals: In the\nweeks leading up to his disappearance, so-called rug pulls\u2014when a\ncryptocurrency exchange or altcoin developer absconds with investors\u2019\nfunds\u2014had crypto investors around the globe flabbergasted. The CEO of Mirror\nTrading International, a crypto trading company based in South Africa,\ndefrauded users of more than $1 billion, then skipped town; TurtleDex, an\nanonymous decentralized finance storage project on Binance, reportedly\nvanished with $2.4 million; another decentralized finance project, Meerkat,\nreportedly fleeced investors out of $31 million (of which they paid back 95\npercent). Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis ranked rug pulls as the primary\nscam of 2021, accounting for 37 percent of all cryptocurrency scam revenue\nthat year, up from 1 percent the year before.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nThodex was at the top of that roster, and nearly every major outlet from\nBloomberg to Newsweek published headlines like \u201cTurkish Crypto Exchange Goes\nBust as Founder Flees Country\u201d and \u201cTurkish Cryptocurrency Founder Faruk Fatih\n\u00d6zer Seen Fleeing Country With Suspected $2 Billion From Investors.\u201d CoinGeek\ncalled it \u201cthe biggest scam in the digital asset industry in 2021.\u201d The New\nYork Times\u2019 headline read, \u201cPossible Cryptocurrency Fraud Is Another Blow to\nTurkey\u2019s Financial Stability.\u201d In Turkey, the country I now call home, people\nwere reeling: For years, crypto had been built up\u2014largely by \u00d6zer but by\nothers too\u2014as a way out of economic volatility. Now it seemed like just\nanother way to lose your life savings. But something felt off to me, like the\nwhole story wasn\u2019t being told.\n\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIR\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

He was inseparable\nfrom his brother, G\u00fcven, and sister, Serap. They grew up camping, playing\nvideo games, and cooking together. Friends always pointed out their shared\nsense of humor. His parents ran a print and copy shop in the city of Kocaeli,\ndown the street from their house. They were observant Muslims who gave their\nchildren meaningful names: \u201ctrust\u201d (G\u00fcven), \u201cmirage\u201d (Serap), and \u201cthe one who\ndistinguishes between right and wrong\u201d (Faruk).\n\nKocaeli is an industrial port town about 100 kilometers east of Istanbul\nsurrounded by a checkerboard of tobacco and sugar beet fields, petrochemical\nplants, and paper mills. Roman emperors once lived there, and their crumbling\nfortress walls still wind through the landscape. After the Ottoman Empire\ncollapsed, Kocaeli became a manufacturing boomtown, and its residents muscled\nthe newly minted Republic of Turkey into the Industrial Revolution.\n\nWhen \u00d6zer was born, Turkey\u2019s economy was in a tailspin. A fragile financial\nsystem, irresponsible borrowing, and political corruption had triggered a\nbrief period of triple-digit inflation. The lira\u2019s volatility threatened the\nsavings of its entire population. So many people moved their domestic assets\nto foreign-currency deposits that, by the end of the year, an astonishing 50\npercent of bank deposits in Turkey were in a foreign currency. The year\nbefore, that figure was just 1 percent.\n\nThat same month \u00d6zer was born, a charismatic orator with a sympathetic gaze\nand push-broom mustache began campaigning through Istanbul\u2019s streets in a\npaisley kipper tie. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan railed against the secular elite who\nhad led the country to near economic collapse. A devout Muslim, he walked the\nstreets of his home neighborhood, Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa, a hardscrabble district where he\ngrew up selling simit, or sesame bread, promising reform. In an upset\nelection, he coasted into the role of mayor of Istanbul.\n\nAround the same time, two Turkish business moguls launched Turkcell, the\nnation\u2019s first mobile communication system. (This was a year and a half before\nthe same technology was released in the US.) By 2003, Erdo\u011fan was elected\nprime minister, kicking off a decade of unprecedented growth that foreign\nobservers called Turkey\u2019s \u201cSilent Revolution.\u201d In a turn away from his\npredecessors, he governed through the lens of a businessman, inaugurating a\nmassive building boom across the country and ultimately wrangling Turkey\u2019s\nrampant inflation. His pro-business rhetoric boosted the middle class and set\nTurkey on a path to European Union membership.\n\n\u00d6zer also caught the spirit of entrepreneurship at an early age. As a teenager\nin the mid-aughts, he worked after-school shifts at his parents\u2019 print shop.\n\u201cEver since I was a child, I wanted to do my own business, no matter what\nsector it was,\u201d he said. At the end of his second year in high school, he\ndecided that further study would not lead him to that dream, so he dropped\nout.\n\nBy 2013, Turkey\u2019s gross domestic product had nearly tripled, the lira hovered\njust above the dollar, and the country was negotiating entry into the EU.\nBtcTurk, Turkey\u2019s first crypto exchange (and reportedly the world\u2019s fourth),\nwas preparing to launch. Then, in May of that year, a group of activists\ngathered at Gezi Park in Istanbul to protest plans to redevelop it into a\nshopping mall with Ottoman-era architecture. They bridled not only at the loss\nof green space but also at the glorification of Turkey\u2019s Islamist past in a\nsociety that called itself secular. Police brutally cracked down on the\nprotesters, sparking a nationwide movement. Within weeks, more than 3 million\npeople had taken part in the demonstrations, their frustration now\nencompassing the growing authoritarianism of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government. Thousands\nwere injured, and at least five died. \u00d6zer had just turned 19. In the\nfollowing years, Erdo\u011fan tossed a record number of journalists in jail and\ncensored the internet, and foreign investors recoiled.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

Polat, an expert in engineering, information tech,\nand new media, was the first person to cover crypto on his YouTube channel.\nNow a lecturer at Istanbul\u2019s Kadir Has University, the way he tells it, crypto\nwas about trying to be financially free. In those early days, he says, \u201cit was\nnot the coin, but the spirit.\u201d (After all, bitcoin was worth only $77 at the\ntime.) For young people who felt that Erdo\u011fan had pulled the rug out from\nunder them, whether they knew it explicitly or not, crypto was a new way to\nprotest.\n\nAt the same time, \u00d6zer\u2019s generation was watching as tech startups were taking\noff around the world. Facebook had bought Instagram for $1 billion, and that\nspurred entrepreneurs to begin churning out apps. A lot of them were gaming-\nfocused; Candy Crush brought in $1.5 billion in revenue in 2013. The \u00d6zers\ntook note.\n\nBy then, Turkcell had become one of the world\u2019s largest companies. Turkey\u2019s\nmobile infrastructure and smartphone adoption rate became one of the fastest\ngrowing in the world. Polat credits this as the foundation for what came next:\nThe dream began to shift from mere employment to entrepreneurship. G\u00fcven\ncofounded a company called Inline Yaz\u0131l\u0131m; Faruk started one called Inline\nTeknoloji a few years later and another called Game Bridge after that. The\nbrothers figured out how to crank out chintzy apps\u2014cut-and-paste washboard abs\nfor Instagram photos (pre-vanity-filters era) and addictive gambling games. \u201cI\nstarted to sell almost every product that I thought could make a profit on the\ninternet,\u201d he told me. \u201cThis is how I took my first step into business life.\u201d\n\nBy 2017, 14 years into Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rule, Turkey\u2019s economy had come full circle.\nErdo\u011fan\u2019s unorthodox economic policies\u2014repeatedly cutting interest rates\u2014were\nsupposed to raise investment and make Turkey less dependent on foreign powers.\nInstead they led the country into an economic crisis; the value of the lira\nhit the skids, and after a failed coup attempt in 2016 people figured it would\nonly get worse. Just as they had 23 years earlier, citizens began searching\nfor places to shelter their money. Voil\u00e0, 2017 was also the first year\nbitcoin\u2019s value shot sky high, from $9,000 to $20,000. Global trade volume\nalso skyrocketed from $99 million to $16 billion.\n\nBeing early investors in tech wasn\u2019t something that had historically been\navailable to the average person in Turkey. The instant millionaires and\nbillionaires and unicorns pretty much lived elsewhere. Now, Faruk \u00d6zer saw a\npossibility. People in Turkey could shelter their money in what was clearly\ngoing to be the next big tech boom. But the biggest opportunity wasn\u2019t in\ntrading coins\u2014it was in running a cryptocurrency exchange. Exchanges collect\npeople\u2019s money and, for a commission, invest it; that gives people who don\u2019t\nhave the time or skills to invest directly into the blockchain a pathway to\ncrypto. Users who go through an exchange don\u2019t even have their own digital\nwallets; their money is stored until they withdraw it. (Hence the industry\nwarning: \u201cNot your wallet, not your coins.\u201d)\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

There were no regulations on running a cryptocurrency\nexchange; \u00d6zer could open one easier than he could open a simit stand. He\ncould become rich. Everybody might become rich. So at the age of 23, \u00d6zer\nfounded Thodex with 40,000 lira\u2014around $11,100 at the time\u2014of his own money.\nSoon, Serap began working for \u00d6zer as a company accountant; G\u00fcven too seemed\nto be around a lot, but his ties were unofficial.\n\nUsing a playbook from Silicon Valley, \u00d6zer began spreading the gospel of\ncrypto around Turkey. By this time, there were a few other notable exchanges,\nbut \u00d6zer gave crypto a face and a ubiquitous presence. He put up ads on\nbillboards and at bus stations; he installed Turkey\u2019s first bitcoin ATM in a\nluxury mall in Istanbul\u2019s posh Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 neighborhood, more as a stunt than\nanything. In a TV interview, he explained, \u201cPeople realized that it is a\ntechnology that they can turn into cash at any time. One of the most important\nhelping tools in the spread of this perception was undoubtedly bitcoin ATMs.\u201d\nHe aired television commercials pushing Thodex, featuring a dozen Turkish\ncelebrities, including actress P\u0131nar Deniz and pop star Simge. That caught the\nattention of Turkey\u2019s middle and upper classes.\n\nIn 2020, the company secured a money services business license from the US\nTreasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. \u00d6zer paraded it around like a\ntrophy.\n\nSoon, \u00d6zer was ingratiated into the upper echelons of Turkish society. He was\ninvited to sit on the board of organizations such as Blockchain Turkey, a\nrespected crypto nonprofit in Istanbul, alongside the country\u2019s biggest\nbankers. He was attending private meetings with Turkey\u2019s highest ministers. He\nappeared regularly on news channels and in tech blogs. At one point, Thodex\nwas hacked for many millions of lira (supposedly $14 million US), allegedly\nfrom an IP address in China. \u00d6zer says he compensated the customers\u2019 losses\nout of his own pocket and reported the theft to the Istanbul Public\nProsecutor\u2019s cybercrime unit. Experts from regulating agencies audited\nThodex\u2019s financial infrastructure\u2014and \u00d6zer claimed they gave the company a\nclean bill of health. (Though that couldn't be confirmed.)\n\nIstanbul began to feel like Las Vegas. Dazzling billboards and banners hawking\ncrypto coins were everywhere. Backgammon caf\u00e9s, where old men have been\ndrinking tea and talking politics for centuries, buzzed with crypto gossip.\nSigns appeared on barber shops and storefronts advising customers that they\ncould pay with bitcoin. Bitcoin booths opened in the Grand Bazaar, next to the\ngold-trading stalls where people once sheltered their money when empires\ncollapsed. By 2020, Turkey had more people using cryptocurrency than almost\nanywhere else in the world. Istanbul had concluded a sweeping economic\nmetamorphosis, from a historic trading post to an information technology\nleader to one of the top mobile gaming centers on the planet. And finally to a\ncryptocurrency capital. Crypto \u201ctransformed into a national mindset\u201d among\nyoung people, Polat says.\n\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIR\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

But on the other side of the medallion, if\neveryone leaves the fiat\u2014if everyone leaves the social agreement of their\nnation\u2014it could derail the world.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, Thodex moved into a sprawling high-rise in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y, a chockablock\ndistrict on the Asian side of Istanbul. It had a big open floor plan and views\nof the Marmara Sea. Thodex was now the fastest-growing and second-largest\ncryptocurrency exchange in Turkey. In the office, \u00d6zer had a reputation for\nkeeping to himself. His 85 employees, most of whom applied for their jobs at\nThodex through ads on platforms like LinkedIn, say they were paid on time,\nreceived bonuses, got their time-off requests approved quickly, and enjoyed\nthe Thodex-branded coffee mugs and other swag. But the young man in charge\nclearly had some bluster. One former employee told me \u00d6zer\u2019s avatar on the in-\nhouse messaging system was an image of Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s character from The\nWolf of Wall Street.\n\nLike any CEO, \u00d6zer wanted to make it as easy as possible for customers to\nspend money on his products. He started a customer service center called\nThodex Academy that offered an introductory guide to cryptocurrencies for new\ninvestors. He offered scandalously cheap commission rates, so low that\nindustry experts were stumped as to how Thodex could be making a profit. The\ncompany also allowed people to buy crypto via credit cards; at times that was\nmoney an investor didn\u2019t really have, but the hope was that a coin\u2019s value\nwould go up faster than the interest accrued on the card. (The US Securities\nand Exchange Commission was alerting the public to avoid crypto exchanges\npromoting the practice.)\n\n\u00d6zer was also intent on taking Thodex global. In 2020, the company secured a\nmoney services business license from the US Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network. \u00d6zer endlessly paraded it around like a trophy, touting\nit in news interviews, on Thodex\u2019s website, and on social media. Like the\naudit a few years earlier, the license seemed to prove that Thodex was\nlegit\u2014that it had passed all the record-keeping and anti-money-laundering\nchecks, that it was a company people could trust.\n\nBy March 2021, 16 percent of people in Turkey were using crypto, putting the\nnation in the top five for crypto use, along with Nigeria, Vietnam, the\nPhilippines, and Peru\u2014all countries with struggling economies.\n\nThe value of the lira, meanwhile, was at a historic low\u2014as was Erdo\u011fan\u2019s\napproval rating. In April, Turkey\u2019s Central Bank announced a ban on the use of\ncrypto for purchases or services, set to go into effect later that month. This\nsent a shock wave across the global crypto market. (Bitcoin\u2019s value dropped\n4.6 percent.) The central bank issued a statement saying bitcoin could \u201ccause\nnon-recoverable losses.\u201d It also said bitcoin\u2019s use could undermine confidence\nin the lira. The bank and Erdo\u011fan promised more regulations to follow. \u00d6zer\u2019s\nentire empire was under threat.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

It worked\u2014sort of. Thodex\u2019s trade volume reportedly climbed to $538\nmillion. At the same time, the price of bitcoin soared again, reaching a high\nof $63,000. If there ever was a ripe moment to flee with Thodex\u2019s cold wallet,\nthis was it. Days later, \u00d6zer stood at the Istanbul Airport, a ticket to\nTirana in his hands.\n\nAs \u201cwanted\u201d fliers with \u00d6zer\u2019s picture went up on telephone poles across\nAlbania, Erdo\u011fan held a Q&A with college students from all over the country\nand talked about his \u201cwar\u201d with crypto. The outlook for Thodex\u2019s 400,000\ncustomers was grim. So many Thodex investors had put all of their money into\n\u00d6zer\u2019s company\u2014and all of their spouses\u2019, parents\u2019, in-laws\u2019, and kids\u2019 money\ntoo. They had taken out loans and lines of credit to buy more crypto.\n\nOne investor named Mahmut\u2014$100,000 lost\u2014had been using Thodex for three years\nand was in the final stages of buying a house and car for his family. (Like so\nmany victims, he didn\u2019t want to use his full name, because of a heavy burden\nof shame.) Mahmut had tried to withdraw his money\u2014a mixture of savings and\nloans\u2014in the days before the collapse, but it never came through. He attempted\nsuicide three times. When his 2-year-old was diagnosed with autism, Mahmut\ntook a job as a security guard at a storage facility to help pay for services\nfor his son. At least two other investors were reported to have died by\nsuicide.\n\nThen there were friends of the family; G\u00fcven and Serap had also recruited\ncustomers. One was a former colleague of G\u00fcven\u2019s; they had worked together\nthrough an advertising agency. G\u00fcven personally made a Thodex account for this\ncolleague. Over time the two became friends, calling each other on birthdays.\nAbout G\u00fcven, the friend told me, \u201cHe\u2019s a nice person who likes to joke\naround.\u201d\n\nPeople were devastated about losing their life savings, but they were also\nplagued by the mystery of what happened to \u00d6zer; they talked about \u00d6zer\nhaunting them in recurring dreams.\n\nBut when he saw the maintenance notice on Thodex\u2019s website, he called G\u00fcven to\nask about withdrawing his money. \u201cHis phone was off, and would never turn on\nagain after that,\u201d he said. \u201cI believed in it. It had public credibility. It\nhad a license. It had an office. Tax registration number. Employees. It\nchecked out as a reputable company,\u201d he said. He lost $7,900\u2014but, worse than\nthat, he said, \u201cI trusted it so much that I recommended Thodex to many\nfriends, and they all lost their money too.\u201d\n\nVictims formed support groups online. People were devastated about losing\ntheir life savings, but they were also plagued by the mystery of what happened\nto \u00d6zer; they talked about \u00d6zer haunting them in recurring dreams. People\nquestioned how \u00d6zer\u2014this self-made 27-year-old who didn\u2019t quite fit the\nprofile of a tech bro or a transnational cybercriminal\u2014could engineer the\nbiggest theft Turkey had ever seen all by himself.\n\nTwo months after the collapse, Sedat Peker, an infamous, self-exiled mafia\nboss turned YouTuber, inflamed the situation with a series of cryptic posts on\nhis YouTube channel and Twitter, accusing Turkey\u2019s interior minister of\ncollusion and profiteering. (The minister denied it, but photos of \u00d6zer and\nhim at a 2019 meeting fueled a heap of conspiracy theories.) At one point\nbefore he disappeared, \u00d6zer apparently stayed in pandemic lockdown with the\nson of a member of Turkey\u2019s parliament as they prepared to launch a new\ndigital wallet service called Hoppara. A lawyer representing some victims\nspeculated on a phone call with me that Thodex was actually a money laundering\nscheme, that \u00d6zer was just a puppet, and some other power was pulling the\nstrings. Others I spoke with echoed this theory, and more than a few people\nstrongly cautioned me to stop my reporting. Soon I started receiving anonymous\nthreats.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

(As the joke about people who steal money and blame it on\nhackers goes, \u201cI lost my bitcoin in a boating accident.\u201d) They came up short.\nWhile others looked for the money, I decided to search for \u00d6zer. He reminded\nme of the young founders I used to interview in San Francisco when I was\ncovering tech in 2013\u2014ambitious, naive, and at times loose with ethics. Also,\nwhat aspiring fugitive would say where they were absconding to and then post\nletters from the road? So I booked a ticket for Tirana, the last place \u00d6zer\nwas seen.\n\nTwo days later my apartment in Istanbul was ransacked in a way that seemed\nlike a stern message. The wood on my front door was split open by force, and\nthe contents of every drawer and cabinet were tossed around. The lock to a\nsafe was snipped open, its contents\u2014expensive camera equipment and\ncash\u2014remained untaken. Even a laptop on the entry table appeared untouched. I\ncanceled the trip.\n\nNearly one year after he disappeared, there was no sign of \u00d6zer or the money.\nRumors flew that he was no longer in Albania. He could be in a hotel in\nMontenegro, a yacht off Kosovo, or a tropical hideaway in Thailand, people\nsaid; or he could be locked in a Tirana basement. People told me they thought\nhe was dead, resting in a shallow grave.\n\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIR\n\nG\u00fcven and Serap idled in prison, awaiting their brother\u2019s capture so that\ntheir trial could begin. In March 2022, Istanbul\u2019s public prosecutor and\nTurkey\u2019s Financial Crimes Board released the findings of their investigation.\nThey painted \u00d6zer as a rapacious mountebank who used star-powered pitchmen to\ndupe people into funneling their savings into his criminal organization. The\nreport asserted that, in 2017, \u00d6zer founded Thodex with the intention of\noperating it as a crime ring for money laundering and that every employee was\na willing part of it\u2014from the top executives down to the call-center workers\nwho were placating customers and the social media managers who lured victims\nwith promotions and sweepstakes.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

It said that about $8 million in\nThodex-held assets had been cashed out in gold bricks in Malta a few weeks\nbefore \u00d6zer\u2019s disappearance. \u00d6zer might have escaped, but his employees and\nfamily were facing the possibility of spending many lifetimes in prison.\n\nJust as hope of \u00d6zer\u2019s resurfacing dwindled, the drama took a new twist: Sevgi\nErarslan, a lawyer whom \u00d6zer\u2019s father had hired initially to pay the victims\nback, then to represent his son in absentia, introduced herself to Twitter via\na shocking tweet: She said she would refund any victims of Thodex if they\nlegally withdrew their complaint against her client.\n\nA wave of questions followed\u2014where was this money coming from, and was \u00d6zer\nnot just alive but in contact with Erarslan while wanted by Interpol? I sent\nher an email asking if I could speak with \u00d6zer. To my surprise, she called me\nimmediately, saying that \u00d6zer was willing to be in touch. We began an\noccasional correspondence, though I often wondered if he really was the person\nanswering my questions, if he was even really alive.\n\nThe trial went forward under a swirl of confusion and skepticism\u2014about \u00d6zer\u2019s\nwhereabouts, about the large payments now being sent to victims from\nundisclosed sources, and about Erarslan\u2019s legitimacy as his official lawyer.\nOf the 62 people who had been initially arrested, 21 were charged. On an\novercast July morning, officers escorted those defendants into Istanbul\u2019s\nbeige brutalist courthouse, just a short walk from the Thodex headquarters\nwhere all the people on trial had once worked.\n\nG\u00fcven wore a dark olive blazer, and his mustache was trimmed into a neat\nchevron. Serap sat with her back turned to him, cloaked in a trench coat\npulled over a midnight black abaya. \u00d6zer\u2019s lawyer, Erarslan, wore Turkey\u2019s\nsatin lawyer cloak and carried a Louis Vuitton purse. The sound of dozens of\nhandcuffs being unhitched echoed through the cavernous room.\n\nWhen G\u00fcven\u2019s name was called, he stood, flanked by two crew-cut court officers\nsporting the dark irony of his name emblazoned on their vests (\u201cG\u00fcvenlik\u201d\nmeans \u201csecurity\u201d). He told the court that he had no official ties to Thodex.\n\u201cI only come to the office for tea with my siblings,\u201d he said. He explained\nhow Thodex subcontracted his company for advertising services, and added: \u201cMy\nbrother asked me to give him my personal account that I wasn\u2019t using, so I let\nhim use it.\u201d Saying that his brother told him he was going to Albania to try\nto sell the company, he corroborated Faruk\u2019s claim.\n\nWithout looking at her brother, Serap rose and explained that she was only an\naccountant; her job was to forward documents to an accounting firm. Like\nG\u00fcven, she had given Faruk her personal crypto exchange and bank account\ninformation at his request. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he was going to use it,\u201d Serap\nsaid. \u201cI can\u2019t say that my brother opened those fake accounts in my name.\nIdentity theft is common; it could have been anyone.\u201d The head judge twirled\nher pen as Serap spoke, her voice sputtering and cracking. \u201cI have been\nsuffering from both physiological and psychological problems. I am so worn out\nphysically.\u201d When she began losing her breath and stumbling over her\nsentences, the judge excused her from the stand.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

The judge shut her down, saying that the document\nwas invalid.\n\nOne of the victims\u2019 lawyers stood up and shouted that Erarslan should be\nkicked out of the courtroom. Erarslan shouted back. The room erupted into a\ncircus. Judges and lawyers, victims and defendants\u2014all volleyed slurs and\naccusations at one another. One of the defendants\u2019 lawyers yelled at the\njudge: \u201cYou need to know how crypto works. To have a fair trial you have to\nunderstand how crypto works.\u201d\n\nLate one August night in 2022, a few days before the defendants back in\nIstanbul were to receive their verdicts, it became clear that \u00d6zer was very\nmuch alive. The Albanian police had been tailing a BMW X5 that they suspected\nwas \u00d6zer\u2019s and traced the car to an elegant two-story art-deco villa in the\nhills of Vlor\u00eb, a ritzy tourist town on what\u2019s billed as the Albanian Riviera.\n\nJust outside the driveway, they pulled over and waited. At 2:30 am, two people\nleft the house and got into the BMW and started to pull out of the driveway.\nThe cops stopped it, arrested two young men, and a police squad in bulletproof\nvests and balaclavas stormed the villa. In video footage taken of the raid,\n\u00d6zer, shirtless and wearing red shorts, looks shocked. He stumbles around the\nroom. On a wall behind him, liquor bottles line the shelves. Three women were\nin the villa too. An officer grabbed \u00d6zer, and the young CEO, now wearing a\nwhite polo shirt, was handcuffed, escorted down a short flight of stairs,\nshuttled into an unmarked white van, and driven into the night.\n\nAt the police station in Tirana, \u00d6zer told the cops that he had been \u201chiding\nin the streets of poor neighborhoods.\u201d He added that he got around by bus.\n\u201cSince I grew up in a poor neighborhood in Turkey, I know how to deal with\npoor people. I looked for a house to rent by asking people on the streets.\u201d He\nalso said that he had been living off of $10,000 in cash he had brought into\nthe country and money that was occasionally being wired to him\u2014plus, some\ncrypto trading. He confessed that he planned on eventually escaping to Greece.\n\nFor nearly a year, \u00d6zer sat in an Albanian prison, appealing his extradition\nback to Turkey. \u201cWe are trying to explain to the court that if I am\nextradited, I do not have a chance to get a fair trial,\u201d he wrote to me. He\ncalled the trial \u201ctragicomic.\u201d His appeal was unsuccessful. In June 2023 he\narrived at Istanbul Superior Court. His head was shaved; he still had the\nscruffy beard. The once buoyant tech founder was now staring down a prison\nsentence that could carry an astonishing 43,000 years.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

Then he started to read\nfrom a 60-page soliloquy, his defense attorney clicking through slides at his\ninstruction.\n\n\u201cI did not defraud anyone, I did not smuggle money abroad, I did not establish\nor manage a criminal organization,\u201d he said with both frustration and\nsincerity in his voice. \u201cI started a company.\u201d He recognized people got hurt.\nThen he began trying to make a case that prosecutors (and the media) had\nsimply, mistakenly, criminalized a business failure.\n\nHe mentioned a litany of those supposed problems: getting hacked, an \u201catomic\nbomb\u201d of Dogecoin panic buying and selling that drained Thodex\u2019s funds after\nthe central bank announced its drastic curtailing of crypto. \u201cThe day I bought\nmy ticket to go to Albania, most of the Dogecoin withdrawal requests could no\nlonger be met,\u201d he said. In his retelling, \u00d6zer arrived at the conclusion that\nthe company itself was worth more than the funds in its wallet, so he saw only\none way out: selling it. He started, he said, shopping it around in Istanbul,\nItaly, and the Balkans. He eventually set up meetings with several potential\nbuyers in Albania. He didn\u2019t give their names. \u00d6zer showed the courtroom a\nnews clip with the widely circulated headline that he had fled with $2 billion\nand defrauded 400,000 people. \u201cAs soon as this news started to appear, both\ninvestors were off the table ... I had no other chance to cover the losses of\nthe stolen cryptocurrencies.\u201d He pointed out that the indictment estimated the\ndamages were closer to $43 million and the number of official claimants\nagainst him totaled 2,027 people.\n\nThen his testimony took a Shakespearean turn. \u201cThis was also done with the aim\nof killing me or having me killed,\u201d he said without flinching. \u201cTo announce to\nthe world that a 27-year-old man with $2 billion in his pocket is alone in a\ncountry with high crime rates like Albania.\u201d That, coupled with a red notice\nfrom Interpol on his back, and his face on wanted posters around Albania, made\nhim fear for his life. So, he said, he bought a tent and took a taxi to the\nsouthern Albanian coastline. He had hoped to ride out the nightmare camping\nalone. \u201cI needed time for the truth to emerge,\u201d he told the room.\n\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIR\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

He said that when he learned about the prosecutor\u2019s indictment\u2014that his\nbrother and sister were charged with fraud, that they would stand trial in a\nmonth, and that without \u00d6zer they would most likely take the blame for\nThodex\u2019s fall and spend the rest of their lives in prison\u2014he had a wild idea:\nIf every claimant were paid back, did a crime ever really happen? He did, in\nfact, have the Thodex cold wallet on him, he told the judges, though he claims\nto not remember how much was in it. He asked Erarslan to help him pay back the\nroughly 2,000 plaintiffs who had lost their money.\n\nAnd they did, in part. In total, while on the run, he paid approximately 185\nmillion lira ($10 million at the time) to more than 1,000 claimants. As \u00d6zer\ntells it, when the cold wallet was empty, he threw it into the Ionian Sea.\n\nWhen he addressed his use of other people\u2019s accounts to trade crypto\u2014an action\nat the center of the case\u2014he started to sound defiant and a little\ncondescending: \u201cStartup founders take all responsibilities, as the nature of\nstartups requires,\u201d he said. He underscored that they had no authority in the\ncompany and no access to these accounts. \u201cThere is no lawlessness or\nirregularity. Moreover, I am neither the first nor the last nor the only\nperson to arbitrage the cryptocurrency market.\u201d\n\nThe draconian sentence is punishment not only for a crime but also for shining\na spotlight on decades of embarrassing failures.\n\nNear the end of his address, \u00d6zer\u2019s frustrations seemed to turn to bitterness\nand hubris. He faced the judges and said it was \u201cabsurd to think that the IQ\nlevel of the person who made such a stupid escape plan\u201d was the same as that\nof a criminal mastermind allegedly capable of deceiving Turkish financial\nregulators for four years. \u201cI am smart enough to lead any institution on\nearth,\u201d \u00d6zer said. Then he had Erarslan pull up an image of a cartoon mocking\nthe court. Visibly annoyed, the chief judge ordered him to remove it.\n\nThe verdict came quietly on a balmy Thursday in September 2023 to an almost\nempty courtroom. \u00d6zer stood and solemnly read the lyrics from a Turkish folk\nsong, \u201cThe End of the Road Is Visible.\u201d\n\nThe chief judge handed G\u00fcven, Serap, and \u00d6zer the same sentence: 11,196 years\nin prison\u2014for establishing and managing a criminal organization and laundering\nassets. Most of the other defendants were released. It was the longest\nsentence in Turkey\u2019s history, handed out the month before the Republic\u2019s\ncentennial.\n\nFaruk Fatih \u00d6zer became a poster child of crypto crimes, but he also became an\naccidental representation of a particular economic era\u2014and the lengths people\nwill go through to flee it. To the Turkish regime, he was not so much an\nopponent as an unfortunate product of flawed economic policies. In that light,\nthe draconian sentence is punishment not only for a crime but also for shining\na spotlight on decades of embarrassing failures, ones that were made clear to\nthe entire country the day that \u00d6zer disappeared.\n\nSo perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that Turkey remains a haven for cryptocurrencies.\nIn the year after Thodex went bust, inflation in the country hit a 24-year\nhigh of 85.5 percent. Prices for goods nearly doubled\u2014and so did the\npercentage of Turks who owned bitcoin, ether, and other currencies. In terms\nof trade volume, the country ranks fourth globally, behind the US, the UK, and\nIndia. After decades of watching their currency devalue, their businesses and\nnest eggs get scrambled, the Turkish people aren\u2019t going to pass up the dream\nso easily. Earlier this year, the country\u2019s finance minister said the\ngovernment was working to finalize new regulations on crypto, \u201cto make this\nfield safer and to eliminate possible risks.\u201d So although \u00d6zer picked a fight\nwith an authoritarian regime and lost\u2014whether because he believed too fully in\nthe gospel of decentralization, because he was a naive kid, because he was a\ncynical hustler, or some combination of all three\u2014the flames of economic\nrevolution that he helped fan aren\u2019t going out anytime soon.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beril Eski, G\u00fcl\u015fah Karada\u011f, and Vladimir Karaj.\n\nLet us know what you think about this article.
