I feel\nhealthier and more aligned with myself, I\u2019m getting my shit together, and I\u2019m\nfiguring things out in a slow but steady pace. But all of these wonderful self\nrealizations and discoveries were not free. In fact, it is a luxury I\ngenuinely can\u2019t afford, and the loans I\u2019ve accumulated are all coming back to\nbite my ass.\n\nI\u2019ve been taking my time with myself as I turn a blind eye into all the\nurgencies surrounding me. Like putting on my earphones to block the external\nnoises from the outside, which isn\u2019t really a good thing to do when you\u2019re\ndriving 120 on a highway. Day by day, I take my time like I was a princess\ntending to her luscious green garden in an apocalyptic world, ignoring the\nfact that the world has gone to shit and everyone is dead. Like they say,\nignorance is bliss, but I\u2019m only feigning ignorance while being completely\naware that my whole life is falling apart so can I really say I\u2019m truly happy?\n\nI have been unemployed for as long as I can remember after graduating\nuniversity, only taking one seasonal part time job in between to keep me\nafloat for another year of desperately trying to make something of myself.\nEvery now and then I would always catch my bank account doing silly lil things\nlike going down, or my debit matching numbers with my credit card. My parents\nare extremely worried for me, and my brother is confused how I\u2019m even still\nalive.\n\nIn all honesty, I feel like I\u2019m financially on life support. I\u2019ve never told\nanyone - not my friends nor family. No one knows about my financial situation\n(other than you now) because I\u2019m afraid and ashamed. Afraid of what will\nhappen, and ashamed that it did. I want to believe that I can eventually get\nthrough this in due time, after all I\u2019m still young and have all the time in\nthe world.. but my parents don\u2019t.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore or how to proceed. I left my previous online\ngig that made quite a bit of money because of a change of heart and moral\nphilosophies. And along with these new ethics and lifestyle changes, the\noptions for online business ventures shrink more and more until there\u2019s barely\nanything to do left. The things that make good money on the internet require\ncertain personality traits and tactics that one must tolerate if they wish to\nbe successful, but none of them align with my beliefs and principles anymore,\nand forcing myself to continue trying will only ruin everything I\u2019ve built so\nfar. What\u2019s there left to do?\n\nI wanted to be something more than just a girl on the internet, but apparently\nit\u2019s not that easy. Is there a way for me to earn really good money without\nlying, deceiving anyone, or being stupid online? Without being annoying,\npolarizing, or insufferable? Without selling your body, your dignity, or your\nsoul? Is there a place for anything meaningful in this numb, apathetic world?\n\nI\u2019ve worked so hard to build my peace only to watch it slowly crumble down\nfrom all the external forces of stress and existential dread. It\u2019s such a\ncurse to be this allergic to fame and fortune.\n\nIf eternal financial suffering is the price of free and happier life, then I\u2019m\nquite doomed to be in debt forever. My free trial in this life has long\nexpired, perhaps I\u2019ve overstayed my welcome.\n\nMaybe I should just unsubscribe.\n\nPowered by Bear \u0295\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294\n\n", "frontpage": false}
