The fringes are projected onto a curved holographic\nplate without intervening optical elements, the curve being such that the\nfringes have a constant pitch along the surface of the plate. A methodology\nfor generating such a curve includes the creation of a graphic representation\nof the hyperbolic fringes generated by the interference between two coherent\npoint sources, which would fall on an appropriately curved holographic plate.\nA numerical technique derived from the graphic representation produces a\n\u201cconstant-pitch\u201d curve such that all of the fringes projected onto the curve\nare equidistant. The holographic plate, coated with a photosensitive material,\nis fabricated or formed in the shape of the constant-pitch curve. After the\nplate is exposed to the interference fringe pattern, the plate is processed to\nproduce a corresponding amplitude or phase structure on the plate. The plate\nis then flattened and used either as a precise linear encoder, or as a master\nfrom which precise linear encoders may be replicated.\n\n### Images (9)\n\n###\n\nClassifications\n\nmachine-classified\n\ncpc-machine-classified\n\nfterm-machine-classified\n\nfterm-family-classified\n\nThe classifications are assigned by a computer and are not a legal conclusion.\nGoogle has not performed a legal analysis and makes no representation as to\nthe accuracy of the classifications listed.\n\nThe CPC classifications are assigned by a computer and are not a legal\nconclusion.

Field of the Invention\n\nThe present invention relates to the manufacture of linear position encoders,\nand more particularly to a low-cost method of manufacture which avoids the use\nof collimating optics.\n\n2\\. Description Relative to the Prior Art\n\nPosition encoders are used in a variety of position measuring equipment. Such\nencoders contain a large number of closely-spaced rulings parallel to each\nother.\n\nAn error-free linear encoder is an encoder in which the pitch, or spacing\nbetween rulings, in constant from end to end. In the past, such encoders were\neither ruled in the same manner that diffraction gratings were ruled, or\nproduced lithographically by reducing a large-scale drawing of the encoder and\nusing a step-and-repeat process to make a long encoder. U.S. Pat. No.\n4,219,933 is an example of the ruling approach. The use of lithography in\nforming diffraction gratings is described by Akedo et al., Formation of a\nDifftactional Grating by Magnetic Lithograph, Nippon Oyo Jiki Gakkaishi, vol.\n13, No. 2, 1989.\n\nMore recently, holography has offered an attractive alternative as a technique\nfor making uniform encoders. In this technique, light from two coherent point\nsources is collimated and the resulting beams are made to overlap in the\nregion where the holographic encoder is to the exposed. FIG. 1 depicts an\napparatus used in the holographic approach. Referring to FIG. 1, two coherent\nlight sources 2, 4 radiate light cones 6,8 which are reflected off collimating\nmirrors, which create an overlapping region 14 in which interference fringes\nare produced. A hologram plate 16 is disposed within the area of the fringes.\n\nWhen the interference fringe pattern is generated, a series of bright bands\nappears where the two beams constructively interfere, and alternate dark bands\nwhere they destructively interfere. The pattern is generated in this way in\nthe plane of the hologram plate, which may be a photographic plate, or other\nphotosensitive surface. In the case of a photographic plate, the exposed\nemulsion is then fixed and hardened in an acid bath. Further processing\ninvolves a prewash, followed by a hypoclearing, a wash in filtered water, and\na final methanol bath before drying. U.S. Pat. No. 4,265,534 describes a\nprocess of this type in detail.\n\nThe holographic approach offers a number of advantages. First, this method\nproduces an encoder in which high-spatial-frequency errors are absent. Once\nthe setup is in place, this method allows for the rapid replication of\nencoders, one after another, with relative ease. By use of this method, it is\nrelatively easy to produce an encoder with a pitch on the order of a\nwavelength. When using this method, a \u201cfringe locker\u201d can be used to stabilize\nthe interference fringes for long exposures. The fringe locker is well known\nin the art, being a fringe stabilization system that views a part of the\nfringe pattern (above or below the hologram plate) and which electronically\ncontrols the relative phases of the two point sources so that the fringes\nremain locked in position\u2014thus compensating for air turbulence, vibrations,\netc. that might otherwise move the fringe pattern.\n\nA major disadvantage of this standard holographic approach, however, is the\nrequirement for collimating optics whose diameters are on the order of the\nlength of the desired encoder, and which require tight control of spherical\naberration in order to maintain a uniform pitch over the entire length of the\nencoder. In the case of encoders in the order of one meter, the optics can be\nextremely expensive to produce.\n\nThe current invention provides a means for producing encoders of a uniform\npitch, providing the advantages of the holographic method, without the need\nfor the expensive collimating optics.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nThese, and further features of the invention, may be better understood with\nreference to the accompanying specification and drawings depicting the\npreferred embodiment, in which:\n\nFIG. 1 depicts the apparatus for producing a Holographic Encoder using\nCollimating Optics.\n\nFIG. 2a depicts the Hyperbolic Fringes generated from 2 Point Sources in one\nquadrant only, showing their positions with respect to a positive x and y\naxis.\n\nFIG. 2b depicts the Hyperbolic Fringes generated from 2 Point Sources in all\nfour quadrants showing their positions with respect to a positive and negative\nx and y axis.\n\nFIG. 3 depicts the Numeric Solution to the Error-Free Linear Encoder Problem\nas a function of displacement along the x axis, expressed as a plot of the\ncurved holographic image plate, and also shows the residual errors of a 5^th\norder polynomial fit to the numerical data.\n\nFIG. 4 depicts the geometry of the components required for holographic encoder\nfabrication in accordance with the present invention.\n\nFIG. 5 depicts a cross section of a portion of the encoder, showing the pitch\nand ideal height of the grooves produced by the method.\n\nFIG. 6 depicts a perspective view of the curved holographic plate.\n\nFIG. 7 depicts a block diagram of the technique used to generate the cross-\nsectional curve of the holographic plate.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nA general object of the current invention to provide a method for producing an\nerror-free linear encoder on the order of 20 to 40 inches in length It is a\nspecific object of this invention to provide such a method which is\ninexpensive, and allows easy, rapid production of the encoders. It is a\nfurther specific object of this invention to provide such a method which uses\nholographic production methods, but does not require collimating optics.\n\nAccording to one aspect of the current invention, a method for making a\nconstant-pitch encoder involves a number of steps, beginning with the\ngenerating of a mathematical representation of the family of hyperbolic\nfringes which appear on a plane located a distance d from the midpoint of two\ncoherent point sources a distance p from each other, the representation having\nan X axis and a Y axis. Next, a constant-pitch curve is calculated, lying in\nthe plane and having a desired size on which the hyperbolic fringes appear\nequidistant, the curve intersecting a line normal to the plane containing the\npoint sources and midway between the point sources at a distance d from said\nmidpoint. Following this a holographic plate is calculated, the plate having a\nsuperior and inferior side, and in which the inferior side has the shape of\nthe constant-pitch curve. The holographic plate is then coated with\nphotosensitive material, and the plate is disposed at a distance d from two\ncoherent point sources a distance p from each other, so that the inferior\nsurface of the plate faces the point sources, and intersects a line normal to\nthe plane containing the point sources and midway between the point sources at\na distance d from the midpoint. The holographic plate is next illuminated with\nthe interference fringes produced by the point sources, and then processed to\nproduce grooves in the plate corresponding to the fringes. Finally, the plate\nis flattened.\n\nAccording to a second aspect of the invention, the calculating of the\nconstant-pitch curve further entails establishing a desired fringe spacing d,\nand then selecting a point f0 on the Y axis where the distance between the\nfringes, when projected onto the X axis, is a small amount less than d. A\npoint on the next adjacent fringe fn is selected such that the distance fn\u2212fd\nis equal to d. This process is repeated with each successive fringe, so that,\nfor the nth fringe, a point on the next adjacent fringe, fn+1, is selected\nsuch that the distance, fn+1\u2212fn, is equal to d. The process is repeated until\neither the curve is the desired size, or until there are no more fringes on\nwhich to repeat the process.\n\nAccording to a third aspect of the invention, the holographic plate is made\nfrom glass.\n\nAccording to a fourth aspect of the invention, the holographic plate is a\nmaster plate, and replicas are fabricated from the master plate by means of\nreplication.\n\nAccording to a final aspect of the invention, the replicas are fabricated from\neither glass, metal, fused silica, Zerodur or Invar.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\nIt is well known that two coherent point sources will produce interference\nfringes which are hyperbolic in shape. When interference from two point\nsources occurs, bright fringes are formed on surfaces which are the loci of\npoints for which:\n\nR _1 \u2212R _2 =ml, (1)\n\nWhere R_1 and R_2 where the distances from the point on the surface to each of\nthe two point sources, 1 is the wavelength of the light, and m is an\ninteger\u2014the order of interference. Each surface of this type is a hyperboloid\nof revolution about an axis formed by the line joining the two point sources.\nThese hyperboloids intersect aplane containing the two point sources in a\nseries of hyperbolae given by:\n\n(x/a)^2\u2212(y/b)^2=1, (2)\n\nWhere, if 2A is the separation between the two point sources (located\nsymmetrically on the x-axis), a=ml/2 and b=(A^2\u2212a^2).\n\nThus, if a planar holographic plate is disposed parallel to a plane containing\nthe two coherent point sources, the fringes which appear in the plane of such\na plate will be along the intersections of the hyperboloids given by\nequation(2) and the surface of the plate.\n\nFIG. 2a shows these hyperbolae for a pair of point sources that are 20\nwavelengths apart. Referring now to FIG. 2a, the X and Y axes represent\ndisplacements in units of wavelengths.\n\nFIG. 2a shows only one quadrant, the first, or positive X,Y quadrant. To show\nthe hyperbolae in all four quadrants, the figure must be reflected about the X\nand Y axes to show the entire fringe pattern. Referring to FIG. 2a, The point\nsources are at (\u221250,0) and (50,0), and the wavelength is 5. The fringes\nintersect the X-axis at intervals of 1\u20442 wavelength. Still referring to FIG.\n2a, the point sources 22 generate a family of hyperbolic fringes, with typical\nfringe 20.\n\nFIG. 2b shows the fringes in all four quadrants. The hyperbola in which curve\n20 is included has a branch in the negative x axis as well, depicted in FIG.\n2b as reference number 21. The point sources 22,24 generate the fringes of\nFIG. 2b.\n\nIf, however, the holographic plate is not planar, but rather curved, it is\npossible to generate a curve such that the fringes appearing on the plate are\nequidistant from each other.\n\nThe approach of the current invention for making an error-free encoder without\ncollimating optics is to find a smooth curve which, when overlaid on FIG. 2a,\nintersects the fringes, which appear as a family of hyperbolae, at equal\nintervals along the curve. This curve will be referred to hereafter as the\nconstant-pitch curve. The intervals are referred to as the pitch of the\nencoder.\n\nReferring now to FIG. 6, the holographic plate 140 must be then fabricated as\na cylinder having a cross section in the shape of this constant-pitch curve\n144, and having a constant width w. Practically speaking the cross section is\nnot a curved line, but also has a thickness d [142]. From a mathematical\nstandpoint, however, it will be treated in the following discussion as if it\nwere a curved line, with the understanding that this line is in fact the\nintersection of the inner face 144 with a plane normal to the depth of the\ncylinder.\n\nAlthough an exact, analytic solution to the problem of generating the\nconstant-pitch curve has not yet been defined, I have developed a numerical\ntechnique for generating families of such curves. This numerical solution can\nbe approximated by a polynomial equation and is described with the help of the\nblock diagram of FIG. 7.\n\nReferring now to FIG. 7, and referring to the hyperbolae of FIG. 2a, the\nconstant-pitch curve is generated with the help of a pair of dividers. For a\nparticular desired fringe spacing, the distance between the divider tips is\ninitially set to the desired fringe spacing 50 by using the X axis as a scale.\nNext one of the divider tips is placed on the Y-axis at a height where the\nlateral, or x, distance between the nearest hyperbolae is a little less than\nthe selected fringe spacing 52. Now, keeping the first point of the dividers\nwhere it is, the dividers are rotated so that the other tip falls on the next\nhyperbola to the right 54. There are two possible intersection points: the one\ncloser to the X-axis is selected. The process 56 is continued, going from one\nhyperbola to the next. The series of points on successive hyperbolae define\nthe shape of the encoder curve.\n\nIt has been found to be time-saving to select a fringe spacing and wavelength\nthat were both scaled up by the same factor (e.g. instead of an actual\nwavelength of 0.4416 \u03bcm and a desired encoder pitch of 10 \u03bcm, a waveleng of\n44.16 \u03bcm and a fringe spacing of 1000 \u03bcm was selected). This, in effect,\nallows the use of every 100^th fringe and reduces the number of computations\nproportionately-without any significant loss in accuracy.\n\nTo extend the curve on the other side of the y-axis, that is, for negative\nvalues of x, the same process is repeated, but intersection points that are\nfurther from the x-axis are selected. This process will continue the curve\nwithout any discontinuity at the y-axis.\n\nFIG. 3 shows a typical numerical solution, the curve 26 being generated by\nthis method. The intersection of curve 26 with the Y axis (that is, at X=0, or\nabout 2100 mm) represents the distance of a flat holographic plate from the\nmidpoint between the point sources which would produce the hyperbolic fringes\nof FIG. 2b when projected upon the plate. However, when the plate has the\ncross-section shown in FIG. 3 the fringes will be equidistant from each other\nwhen falling on the curved plate. Note that in general the curve 26 comes to\nan end\u2014at a point where the distance to the next hyperbola is greater than the\nselected encoder spacing. The shape of the curves so generated are also\nsomewhat counter-intuitive in that they are not symmetric about the y-axis. It\nshould also be noted that the technique for generating the curve of the\nholographic plate has been extended for negative values of X in FIG. 3.\n\nStill referring to FIG. 3, the curve fit error is also plotted, the Y-axis\nscale appearing on the right-hand side of the plot. The error curve is for a\n5^th power polynomial fit to the numeric solution. The figure shows that the\nerror for X values between \u2212175 mm to 500 mm is no greater than about 20\nmicrons.\n\nMaking the Encoder\n\nOnce the shape of the curve is defined and selected as described above, it\nmust be fabricated as a holographic plate. The method described herein is\nsuitable for making encoders up to a meter long. For this purpose, the\ngeometry shown in FIG. 4 is used. Referred now to FIG. 4, it is seen that\npoint sources 22,24 are 100 mm apart and the laser wavelength used is 441.6\nnm. A HeCd laser is used for this purpose. Still referring to FIG. 4, a\nholographic plate 30 having a constant pitch curve of a shape sufficient to\nproduce an encoder with a pitch of 10 microns is located at a distance of 2100\nmm from the a point halfway between the point sources, and normal to a place\ncontaining both point sources. The length of the plate is about 750 mm. FIG. 4\nalso shows a second holographic plate 32, located 2254.40 mm from the point\nsources, with a length of about 800 mm. Both of these plates will produce the\nencoder of the pitch desired, demonstrating that there is more than one\nsolution to this problem.\n\nClearly two material items are required to fabricate the holographic plate:\n(1) a rigid and thermally stable hologram substrate that can be formed into\nthe desired shape, and (2) a form that can be used to define the shape of the\nholographic plate (which will become the encoder), and which will hold the\nplate in place during exposure.\n\nThe form can be made in a straightforward manner from either the numeric\nsolution to the problem, or from a polynomial best-fit to the numeric\nsolution. Although the machining of the form should be smooth and accurate,\nsmall localized errors in the shape of the form will probably have little\neffect. The very nature of bending the substrate to fit the form acts very\neffectively to prevent errors of high-spatial frequency (the substrate simply\nwon't follow such errors). The thickness of the substrate will be selected on\nthe basis of its yield strength, the curve to be followed, and the method used\nto hold the substrate in place on the form. A convex form appears preferable,\nsince a flexible holographic plate can be easily held and bent to fit the\nconvex form. Glasses are readily available in thickness that will allow them\nto be easily bent into the shapes that are needed.\n\nOnce the curved holographic plate is properly aligned with respect to the\npoint sources, and the interference fringes created on the holographic plate,\nthe plate must then be processed to produce grooves, or rulings, in the plate\nwhere the interference fringes exposed photosensitive material on the face of\nthe plate. In actual practice, the flexible glass plate is coated first with\nchromium and then with photo-resist. The photo-resist is then exposed to the\nfringes, and processed to remove the photoresist in the exposed areas (or\nalternatively, the unexposed areas, depending upon the type of photoresist\nused.) The plate is then immersed in an etchant which removes the chromium\nwhere the photo-resist was removed. Finally the plate is further processed to\nremove the residual photoresist. This is a very common protocol and is the\nstandard practice used in making masks for semiconductor lithography.\n\nOnce the hologram is exposed and processed to give the desired groove profile,\nthe curved holographic plate is flattened. This plate then becomes a master,\nand used in the manufacture of replicas\u2014which can be on thicker glass or\nmetal. The material chosen should be one which does not change its dimensions\nwith variations in temperature. Low-expansion glass, low-expansion metal,\niron-nickel alloy, and fused silica are common materials used for this\npurpose. Fused silica, Zerodur and Invar are the preferred choices for the\nreplicas when thermal stability is an issue.\n\nThis process has been used to make a test encoder against a circular form. The\ncircular form does not, of course, produce a constant pitch over the length of\nthe encoder, but it provided means to validate the feasibility of the\nfabrication concept. The resultant encoder had exactly the pitch errors\npredicted by modeling.\n\nCONTROLLING THE GROOVE PROFILE\n\nThe specific goal is the manufacture of an encoder to be used in reflection.\nAlthough an encoder with alternating stripes of reflective and non-reflective\nmaterial will work, the most efficient approach, in terms of the amount of\nlight available to the encoder sensor, is an all reflective encoder with a\nstepped profile. Ideally, when the encoder is illuminated normally by a small\ndiameter beam of specified wavelength, there will be no light in either the\nzero order or in the \u00b12 order-thus minimizing contamination of the \u00b11 orders\nused to make position measurements. These two requirements are met by an\nencoder having a 50% duty cycle and a height 44 of 1\u20444-wavelength, as shown in\nFIG. 5. Still referring to this figure, it is seen that the encoder face has\nalternating raised 40 and depressed 42 cross sections, and that the width of\neach raised cross section is equal to the width of the depressed cross\nsection, or groove. In addition, the distance from the low point to the high\npoint of the profile is one- quarter wavelength. There are a variety of ways\nto manufacture this profile\u2014through a combination of substrate preparation,\nexposure control, and post-exposure processing.\n\nWhile the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments,\nit will be apparent that improvements and modifications may be made within the\npurview of the invention without departing from the scope of the invention\ndefined in the appended claims.\n\n###\n\nClaims (5)\n\nHide Dependent\n\ntranslated from\n\nI claim:\n\n1\\. A method for making a encoder, comprising the following steps, in order:\n\n(a) generating a mathematical representation of the family of hyperbolic\nfringes which appear on a plane located a distance d from the midpoint of two\ncoherent point sources a distance p from each other, said representation\nhaving an X axis and a Y axis;\n\n(b) calculating a apparently constant-pitch curve in said plane of a desired\nsize on which the hyperbolic fringes appear equidistant, the curve\nintersecting a line normal to the plane containing the point sources and\nmidway between the point sources at a distance d from said midpoint;\n\n(c) fabricating a holographic plate into a semicylindrical shape, having a\nsuperior and inferior side, the inferior side having the shape of the\napparently constant-pitch curve;\n\n(d) coating the holographic plate with photosensitive material;\n\n(e) disposing the semicylindrical plate the distance, d, from two coherent\npoint sources with the inferior side facing the two coherent point sources,\nthe axis of the semicylindrical holographic plate perpendicular to a line\nconnecting the two coherent point sources so that interference fringes from\nthe two coherent point sources will appear equidistant on the inferior side of\nthe semicylindrical holographic plate,\n\n(f) illuminating the holographic plate with the interference fringes produced\nby the point sources;\n\n(g) processing the holographic plate to produce grooves in the plate\ncorresponding to the fringes; and\n\n(h) flattening the holographic plate.\n\n2\\.
