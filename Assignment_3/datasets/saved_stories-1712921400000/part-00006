The recent emergence of large language\n> models (LLMs) has given machines new capabilities such as the ability to\n> generate new digital artifacts like text, images, code etc., resulting in a\n> new tool, a generative search engine, which combines the capabilities of\n> LLMs with a traditional search engine. Through the empirical analysis of\n> Bing Copilot (Bing Chat), one of the first publicly available generative\n> search engines, we analyze the types and complexity of tasks that people use\n> Bing Copilot for compared to Bing Search. Findings indicate that people use\n> the generative search engine for more knowledge work tasks that are higher\n> in cognitive complexity than were commonly done with a traditional search\n> engine.\n\nComments:| 32 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Information Retrieval (cs.IR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nComputers and Society (cs.CY); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)  \nACM classes:| J.4  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.04268 [cs.IR]  \n(or arXiv:2404.04268v1 [cs.IR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.04268arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Siddharth Suri [view email] [v1] Tue, 19 Mar 2024 18:17:46 UTC (1,284\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled The Use of Generative Search Engines for\nKnowledge Work and Complex Tasks, by Siddharth Suri and 13 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.IR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.CY cs.SI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
