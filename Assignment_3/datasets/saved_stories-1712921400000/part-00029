Kaiser, Mark Gurman and Bloomberg\n\nApril 10, 2024 at 12:16 AM UTC\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook in 2024.\n\nPhoto by Lionel Hahn/Getty Images\n\nApple Inc. is upgrading its presence in the Miami area, following other Big\nTech companies in setting up outposts or expanding in South Florida.\n\nApple is taking 45,000 square feet (4,181 square meters) in a new building in\nCoral Gables, a wealthy suburb just south of Miami, according to people\nfamiliar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plans are\nprivate.\n\nApple declined to comment.\n\nThe company already has a smaller office in the vicinity, which has focused\nmostly on Latin America as well as the advertising business, including selling\nad slots in the App Store. The firm is also expected to open a large new\nretail store location at the $4 billion Worldcenter development in Miami.\n\nSouth Florida has been a magnet for the ultra-wealthy and their companies\nsince the pandemic upended the U.S. economy, with firms either outright moving\nto the area or expanding their footprints. Amazon.com Inc. is looking for\nroughly 50,000 square feet in Miami, after founder Jeff Bezos moved to Florida\nfrom Seattle. Microsoft Corp. has also leased a new office in the city, in the\nsame building that will serve as headquarters for Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel.\n\nApple\u2019s new Miami space will be at The Plaza Coral Gables, a project\nbankrolled by Agave Holdings, a Mexican family office powered by tequila\nmoney. Raymond James has also set up shop in the building.\n\nThe increased demand for office space has led to sharp increase in rents.\nAsking rates on commercial properties in Miami are now close to $57 a square\nfoot, according to commercial real estate adviser Avison Young.\n\nSubscribe to Data Sheet, our daily newsletter about the business of tech.
