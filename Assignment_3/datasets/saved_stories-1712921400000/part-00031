A key component in our proposed approach is a new attention\n> technique dubbed Infini-attention. The Infini-attention incorporates a\n> compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism and builds in both\n> masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single\n> Transformer block. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on long-\n> context language modeling benchmarks, 1M sequence length passkey context\n> block retrieval and 500K length book summarization tasks with 1B and 8B\n> LLMs. Our approach introduces minimal bounded memory parameters and enables\n> fast streaming inference for LLMs.\n\nComments:| 9 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nMachine Learning (cs.LG); Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.07143 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.07143v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.07143arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Tsendsuren Munkhdalai [view email] [v1] Wed, 10 Apr 2024 16:18:42 UTC\n(248 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Leave No Context Behind: Efficient Infinite\nContext Transformers with Infini-attention, by Tsendsuren Munkhdalai and 1\nother authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
