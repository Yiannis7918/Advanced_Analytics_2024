Unfortunately for fans of Liliputian work machines, the\nAmerican Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators recommended states to ban\nnon-FMVSS compliant cars, including everything keijid\u014dsha, back in 2021. The\nTexas DMV has issued a ruling that these cars are now, and will remain, street\nlegal for use on Texas roadways.

This\nruling by the Texas DMV makes the state the first since the AAMVA decision\nwhich made any effort to allow imported cars to be legally driven again. This\nis all in spite of any imported car 25 years or older being perfectly legal in\nthe eyes of the federal government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nHere Are The Worst Automotive Laws And Regulations\n\nMost Used Cars Are Getting Cheaper Except For Trucks\n\nAccording to Bob: Why SUVs All Sort of Look the Same\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nAccording to Bob: Why SUVs All Sort of Look the Same\n\nTexas actually turned town a law to codify Kei truck legality in the state\nback in 2010, though some Kei enthusiasts have had luck registering and\ndriving their trucks since, though it was always policy that non-FMVSS\ncompliant cars were not legal in Texas. As of last week, the Texas Department\nof Motor Vehicles overturned that policy with a letter to all county tax\nassessor-collectors and licensed dealers to provide guidance on the titling\nand registering of mini vehicles. You can read the letter right here. The most\nimportant part, however, is below:\n\n> Counties should begin accepting and processing title and registration\n> applications for mini vehicles and ensure the applicant or dealer provides\n> all required title and registration documents, including import documents\n> when applicable. Ensure any off-highway use only vehicles are titled but not\n> registered. Do not collect a delinquent transfer penalty for mini vehicles\n> impacted by this [Registration and Title Bulletin].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a win for car enthusiasts in Texas, and the advocates who made it\nhappen are already hard at work to make similar legal changes in Georgia,\nPennsylvania, and Maine. Good luck, and Godspeed, ye heroes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": true}
