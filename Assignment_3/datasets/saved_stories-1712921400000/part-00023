The\nBlogposts Track aims to incentivize researchers to engage in reflective,\ncritical discourse about existing work, offering insights, developing new\nintuitions, and highlighting potential shortcomings.\n\nBuilding on the success of its inaugural year, which saw over 60 submissions\nand 20 accepted posts, the Blogposts Track continues to encourage the machine\nlearning community to contribute to a more open and accessible exchange of\nideas. By providing a formal venue for blog post publication, ICLR is taking a\nsignificant step towards democratizing knowledge dissemination in the field.\n\nThis year, 22 outstanding blog posts have been accepted for publication, each\noffering valuable perspectives on previously published papers. These posts,\nselected through a rigorous double-blind review process, cover a diverse range\nof topics and underscore the depth and breadth of contemporary machine\nlearning research. They not only contribute to the ongoing dialogue within the\ncommunity but also highlight the creative and pedagogical talent of their\nauthors.\n\nWe are excited to highlight three submissions that exemplify the diversity and\nexcellence of the contribution to the track this year:\n\n  * The N Implementation Details of RLHF with PPO \u2013 Revealing the many intricacies of RLHF, this post offers precious insights and fosters a deeper understanding of this new interactive learning paradigm.\n  * How to compute Hessian-vector products?\u2013 Exploring a ubiquitous computational aspect of optimization, this piece gives a clear and practical point of view on this problem.\n  * Bridging the Data Processing Inequality and Function-Space Variational Inference \u2013 Bridging information theory and practical aspects of Bayesian Deep Learning, this blog post gives valuable insights into predictive priors and their applications.\n\nThese posts not only highlight the broad spectrum of topics being explored in\nmachine learning but also underscore the Blogposts Track\u2019s commitment to\nfostering open, insightful, and high-quality scientific dialogue.\n\nIn line with the goal of promoting wider engagement and visibility, most of\nthese blog posts will be presented as posters at the ICLR conference in Vienna\nfrom May 7th to May 11th during special \u201cAffinity Posters\u201d sessions. This\npresentation format will provide a unique opportunity for conference attendees\nto interact directly with the authors, allowing deeper discussions and\npotential collaborations.\n\nAll Blog Posts can be found on the Blog page of the track\u2019s website.\n\nClaire Vernade, Gauthier Gidel, Fabian Pedregosa, Charlie Gauthier, David\nDobre, Leo Schwinn Blogposts Track Program Chairs\n\nAnnouncing the Accepted Workshops at ICLR 2024\n\n#### Related Posts\n\nICLR 2024\n\n#### Announcing the Accepted Workshops at ICLR 2024\n\nICLR 2024\n\n#### Tiny Papers Strike Back: 2023 Reflections and 2024 Announcement\n\nICLR 2024\n\n#### Authors of TMLR publications with Featured and Outstanding Certifications\nat ICLR 2024\n\n#### Recent Posts\n\n  * Blogposts Track ICLR 2024 : Announcing Accepted Blogposts April 2, 2024\n  * Announcing the Accepted Workshops at ICLR 2024 January 8, 2024\n  * Tiny Papers Strike Back: 2023 Reflections and 2024 Announcement November 2, 2023\n  * Authors of TMLR publications with Featured and Outstanding Certifications at ICLR 2024 October 6, 2023\n  * Announcing ICLR 2023 Office Hours April 24, 2023\n  * Ethics Review Process for ICLR 2023 April 12, 2023\n  * Announcing Notable Reviewers and Area Chairs at ICLR 2023 April 5, 2023\n  * Announcing the ICLR 2023 Outstanding Paper Award Recipients March 21, 2023\n  * Get Ready for ICLR 2023 February 17, 2023\n  * Announcing ICLR 2023 Keynote Speakers February 14, 2023\n  * Announcing the Accepted Workshops at ICLR 2023 December 21, 2022\n  * Reflection on the DEI Initiative at ICLR 2022 May 12, 2022\n\n#### Recent Comments\n\nBack To Top\n\nICLR Blog\n\n\u00a9 ICLR Blog 2024\n\nPowered by WordPress \u2022 Themify WordPress Themes\n\n", "frontpage": false}
