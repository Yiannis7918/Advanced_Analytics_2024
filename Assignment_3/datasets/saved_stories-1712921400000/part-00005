I think it will be more the fact\nthat it allows us to see things that maybe we should\u2019ve seen a long time ago,\nbut just haven\u2019t been able to until now.\n\n\u2014 Neil Armstrong, played by Ryan Gosling, in First Man (2018)\n\nImagine the splendor of the night sky, and consider. Even with light pollution\ndiminishing the clarity of the heavens in most of our cities, there is still\nsomething stirring about peering into the abyss. Whether it\u2019s the dozens of\nstars dotting the cityscape or the thousands you can see from a rural vantage,\nthe expanse of space is staggering, even to the naked eye. Add to that the\nwonders coming from deep space telescopes and modern astrophysics. To name\nonly a few: Within the past few months, scientists have identified a planet\nwith a shiny, reflective atmosphere; for a brief period of time, there was a\nsunspot larger than our entire planet; a chunk of metal five times the size of\nHawaii\u2019s Big Island is embedded in the mantle of the Moon; the fabric of\nspace-time ripples like an ocean; and apparently these ripples cause the\nentire cosmos to hum with sonic frequency.\n\nYet, in spite of its grandeur, space is also deadly, a lethal vacuum coupled\nwith lethal radiation. And it\u2019s huge. The great distance between us and our\ncosmic neighbors radically inhibits the possibility for meaningful\ninteraction. A recent article noted that scientists have discovered one of the\nclosest supernovas to Earth \u201cat only 21 million light-years away.\u201d Such\nnumbers are bewildering. Even a voyage to our next-door neighbor Mars requires\nastonishing amounts of fuel, thousands of tons at minimum, relegating the\nprospect of deep space travel to far futures or sci-fi dreams. We are so\nclose, and yet so far.\n\nAt times, when reading the latest astronomical discovery from this awe-\ninspiring, magisterial realm, one feels like Jack Skellington, the King of\nHalloween Town, puzzling over Christmas presents and shouting, \u201cWhat does it\nmean? What does it mean?\u201d For us to make progress in the quest to understand\nwhat space means, we must linger on the question: What is space for?\n\nThe question is rarely asked in this direct way. And yet it is there already,\njust beneath the surface of the many things people say today about a more\npractical matter: Should we go to space? The answers we hear to this question\nget us part of the way \u2014 but then stop just short of naming the deeper truth\nhuman beings have always known about the great promise of space.\n\n##### \u2018Space Is for Us\u2019\n\nThe modern space industry is fueled by the consensus that space is for us.\nSpace exists as a resource to meet human needs, in one form or another. NASA\u2019s\nmarching orders reveal a host of human interests at stake in the modern space\nrace, including governmental, political, economic, and aspirational needs. The\n2017 \u201cPresidential Memorandum on Reinvigorating America\u2019s Human Space\nExploration Program\u201d instructs various agencies, including NASA, to\n\n> lead an innovative and sustainable program of exploration with commercial\n> and international partners to enable human expansion across the solar system\n> and to bring back to Earth new knowledge and opportunities. Beginning with\n> missions beyond low-Earth orbit, the United States will lead the return of\n> humans to the Moon for long-term exploration and utilization, followed by\n> human missions to Mars and other destinations.\n\nGrounding its Moon-based Artemis Program upon this directive, NASA declares,\n\u201cwe\u2019re going back to the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and\ninspiration for a new generation of explorers.\u201d What is space for? Space is\nfor us \u2014 to advance and enrich humanity.\n\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nIt sounds noble, until we probe a little deeper and ask what \u201cfor us\u201d might\nmean. Understandably, NASA\u2019s aims are in large part about U.S. supremacy in\nspace, \u201cmaintaining American leadership in exploration,\u201d as NASA describes the\nArtemis program. However, the Artemis mandate is coupled with Space Policy\nDirective-4, \u201cEstablishment of the United States Space Force,\u201d which would\n\u201censure unfettered access to, and freedom to operate in, space, and to provide\nvital capabilities to joint and coalition forces in peacetime and across the\nspectrum of conflict.\u201d For all its universal humanitarian language, the real\nfuel powering NASA\u2019s rockets is America\u2019s national interest, backed by\nAmerican military might.\n\n#### Delivered to your inbox:\n\nClear thinking on science and tech\n\nOf course, this is nothing new for NASA. According to the agency itself, the\nApollo program sought to put a man on the Moon while also \u201cestablishing the\ntechnology to meet other national interests in space\u201d and \u201cachieving\npreeminence in space for the United States.\u201d This is to be expected. It would\nbe na\u00efve to insist that space exploration funded by national tax dollars be\nfree from national interests. And as suggested by the TV show For All Mankind,\na counterfactual world where Russia beats America to the Moon, we should count\nit a blessing that the biggest player in space has been a nation committed to\ndemocratic ideals.\n\nBut we can easily be tempted to mistake this reasonable view of space\u2019s\npurpose for America as the entire story of space\u2019s purpose per se. If we were\nto view political goals as the whole reason for exploring space, we would\ncheapen the wonder of the heavens. This is why we experience a certain amount\nof cognitive dissonance when we hear that President John F. Kennedy, who\nuttered the rousing words \u201cWe choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do\nthe other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard,\u201d was,\nin NASA\u2019s own later estimation,\n\n> not a visionary enraptured with the romantic image of the last American\n> frontier in space and consumed by the adventure of exploring the unknown. He\n> was, on the other hand, a Cold Warrior with a keen sense of Realpolitik in\n> foreign affairs, and worked hard to maintain balance of power and spheres of\n> influence in American/Soviet relations.\n\nSurely the beauty of the Moon and of Mars demands higher regard than being\nmere pawns in a political scheme.\n\nHardened realists might respond that this is just how government works. If so,\nwe must consider that an unfortunate byproduct of serving the national\ninterest is red tape, which hampers both exploration and national success in\nthe long run. The U.S. space shuttle tragically exemplifies this reality. Far\nfrom an awe-inspiring upgrade to the Saturn V rocket that might open up the\npossibility for interplanetary travel, the actual shuttle was birthed out of\nCold War military concerns and constrained by congressional spending cuts,\nwhich dramatically altered the design, function, and cost of the machine.\nUltimately, these political enmeshments doomed the shuttle to become what Adam\nKeiper, writing in these pages, has called \u201can unmitigated failure\u201d (\u201cA New\nVision for NASA,\u201d Fall 2003). This sad history offers a cautionary tale:\nvaluing space primarily through the lens of national interest will almost\ncertainly reduce our capacity to meaningfully interact with space. As an\nanswer to our question \u2014 \u201cwhat is space for?\u201d \u2014 the nationalistic-militaristic\n\u201cspace is for us\u201d reply falls short.\n\nMeanwhile, space-tech billionaires offer another flavor of the \u201cspace is for\nus\u201d approach, centered not on national interest but the survival of humanity.\nSpeaking at a 2013 conference, SpaceX founder Elon Musk bluntly stated his\nrationale for investing in space exploration: \u201cEither we spread Earth to other\nplanets, or we risk going extinct.\u201d If not explicitly focused on survival,\nJeff Bezos\u2019s galactic aspirations are similarly grounded in an expected\nhumanitarian crisis on Earth. Upon receiving the 2018 Axel Springer Award for\nbusiness innovation and social responsibility, Bezos stated his motivations:\n\n> If we don\u2019t [expand to other planets] we will eventually end up with a\n> civilization of stasis.... If you take baseline energy usage globally across\n> the whole world and compound it at just a few percent a year for just a few\n> hundred years, you have to cover the entire surface of the Earth in solar\n> cells. That\u2019s the real energy crisis.\n\nCompared to the energy constraints of Earth, Bezos finds the solution in\ninterplanetary civilization:\n\n> The solar system can easily support a trillion humans. And if we had a\n> trillion humans, we would have a thousand Einsteins and a thousand Mozarts\n> and unlimited, for all practical purposes, resources from solar power and so\n> on. That\u2019s the world that I want my great-grandchildren\u2019s great-\n> grandchildren to live in.\n\nIs this what space is for \u2014 a planetary Hail Mary for our failed tenure on\nEarth, or an endless battery supplying our ever-increasing energy needs? And\nwhen space ambitions are driven by apocalyptic fervor, what extreme steps are\nwe willing to justify? Musk, for one, does not seem to mind the wanton\ndestruction of Mars\u2019s poles that he thinks may be required for terraforming\nthe planet (in his words: \u201cNuke Mars!\u201d) or the bleak prospects for its early\nexplorers (\u201cHonestly, a bunch of people will probably die in the beginning\u201d).\nLess the blustery showman, Bezos has more to say about the potentials of space\nthan the costs of getting there. But his basic assumption remains\nunquestioned: that scattering trillions of people throughout the solar system\nwill make for a brighter human future.\n\nWill it? Having a few thousand more geniuses on hand, without a corresponding\ngrowth in virtue, will not likely make a dent in human suffering. And if that\nfuture turns out to be bleak, are the vast riches of outer space worth turning\ninto consumables for the interplanetary masses? By reducing the riches of\nouter space to mere resources for our survival, we risk losing them entirely\nto space barons who insist that their conquest of space ultimately ushers in\nthe good of all humankind. In its apocalyptic shade, \u201cspace is for us\u201d reaches\na destructive nadir.\n\nAside from nationalistic or anti-apocalyptic motivations, there is a final\nversion of \u201cspace is for us\u201d worth exploring, one that has often been advanced\nin the pages of this journal: a romantic-idealistic version. For this type of\nwriter, outer space provides the last meaningful frontier to fulfill the human\nneed to explore. Robert Zubrin writes that the prospect of sending humans to\nMars \u201cis the chance to do something heroic, to advance humanity on the\nfrontier\u201d (\u201cThe Human Explorer,\u201d Winter 2004). For Adam Keiper, such heroism\nis tied into our very nature: \u201cwe must go to space: it is the human thing to\ndo\u201d (\u201cA New Vision for NASA,\u201d Fall 2003). Far from being detriments, the risks\ninherent in space travel actually provide the necessary backdrop for human\nheroism. As Charles T. Rubin movingly writes, \u201cit is the grand vision, the\nsense of destiny and purpose, the excitement of playing out the widest range\nof human possibility, which sustains our long and risky journey into the dark\u201d\n(\u201cThumos in Space,\u201d Fall 2007).\n\nThe romantic-idealistic account of space-meaning strikes much closer to the\nactual experience of outer space. For the average person stargazing on a clear\nevening, the first thought is not \u201cI wonder if those stars could fuel my\ngreat-grandchildren\u2019s energy needs,\u201d but rather the wonder-filled \u201cWhat would\nit be like to see that up close?\u201d This imaginative, emotional connection with\nouter space prompts James Poulos to re-cast the quest for human exploration of\nMars, not as a functional escape from Earth, but as an expression of eros, \u201ca\ncosmic, intimate, and given relationship of loving destiny\u201d (\u201cFor the Love of\nMars,\u201d Spring 2018). Space is grand and attractive, inspiring the human need\nfor challenge and striving. This is why movies such as First Man, Apollo 13,\nOctober Sky, and especially 2001: A Space Odyssey resonate so deeply.\nRomantic-idealistic space-meaning is on to something.\n\nAnd yet, this vision still feels incomplete, because it stops short of naming\nthe very impulse driving it forward. Romantic-idealistic space advocates laud\nthe human need to overcome hard things. But why this hard thing? Why space?\nThere are any number of human endeavors that are both challenging and\nbeneficial: safer oil pipelines, longer bridges, taller buildings, a rat-free\nNew York City. Many dangerous places remain under-explored: Antarctica, the\nHimalayas, the Mariana Trench. Yet none of these command our universal human\naffection like outer space. There must be something more to space-meaning than\nus, something that these writers gesture toward but never fully articulate.\nSpace may be, in part, for us. And yet, the sheer Otherness of space \u2014 its\nvastness and bewitching beauty \u2014 gestures toward an innate, transcendent\ndignity.\n\n##### \u2018Space Is for Space\u2019\n\nThere is another version of space-meaning, centered on the inherent dignity of\nouter space. As astrodynamicist and self-described space environmentalist\nMoriba Jah puts it, space \u201cbelongs to no one.\u201d It exists in and for its own\nright. In other words, space is not for us; space is for space.\n\nSpace-centric arguments are numerous and varied. At times, they overlap with a\nmore humble \u201cspace is for us\u201d approach. Space regulations such as the 1967\nOuter Space Treaty, the less-successful 1979 Moon Agreement, and even the\nrecent Artemis Accords stress the value of respecting and preserving celestial\nbodies and sharing the benefits of exploration with nations who have yet to go\nthere. Even while these international agreements accept the permissibility of\nharvesting space materials for human use, they lay the groundwork for thinking\nabout space as a common good, perhaps with a value independent of humanity.\n\nOther \u201cspace is for space\u201d arguments rest on pragmatic grounds. Writing in a\nDubai newspaper in the mid-2010s, amidst the rapid growth of Middle Eastern\nspace programs, foreign policy expert Narayanappa Janardhan raised the\ndecades-old concerns of waste, militarization, and how humanity has already\nmismanaged life here on Earth as reasons to \u201cleave space alone!\u201d While\neschewing this purely hands-off approach, others argue that, at the least, it\nshould not be human hands doing the exploring. Writing in Scientific American,\nDonald Goldsmith and Martin Rees argue that, in spite of possible gains for\nnational pride and the human spirit, the actual costs of human missions to\nMars, including the potential cost in human lives, renders the pursuit\nthoroughly unwise. Maciej Ceg\u0142owski, a tech entrepreneur and writer, agrees:\nAfter detailing the costs of a human Mars mission \u2014 \u201csomething north of half a\ntrillion dollars\u201d \u2014 and the current gaps in our engineering, such as reliable\nlong-term life support and dependable mechanisms for preventing widespread\ncontamination, Ceg\u0142owski concludes, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t send human beings to Mars,\nat least not anytime soon. Landing on Mars with existing technology would be a\ndestructive, wasteful stunt whose only legacy would be to ruin the greatest\nnatural history experiment in the Solar System.\u201d This pragmatic version of\n\u201cspace is for space\u201d rests less on the positive independence of space than on\nits thorough inaccessibility.\n\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nMary-Jane Rubenstein, professor of religion and science at Wesleyan\nUniversity, offers a different account of cosmocentric space-meaning in her\n2022 book Astrotopia: The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race. Her\ncritique begins with theology: the drive to conquer space, or even imagine it\nas a frontier, is driven by Western colonialist-imperialist-religious\ndoctrine. From a misreading of Genesis 1 and 2 that centers on human dominion,\nto the European \u201cDoctrine of Discovery,\u201d to the American \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d\nto the modern space race, for her there is a clear running thread: salvation\nthrough conquest. The modern \u201cspace is for us\u201d entrepreneurs, in her reading,\nshare a theological heritage with those who conquered the Americas or the Wild\nWest because it was there for the taking, \u201cthus saith the Lord.\u201d\n\nBecause a religious problem demands a religious solution, Rubenstein rejects\nWestern Christianity and opts for a pragmatic blend of pantheism and\nindigenous spirituality that beholds outer space as possessing its own\npersonal integrity. Drawing from philosopher Holmes Rolston III, the question\nis not \u201chow \u2018this astronomical world can belong to us\u2019\u201d but rather \u201c\u2018how we\nbelong to it,\u2019 and \u2018whether it belongs to itself.\u2019\u201d She quickly qualifies this\nradical premise by stating a more pragmatic goal: \u201cLet me say from the outset\nthat I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ethically necessary to say that rocks have rights in\norder to envision a just and peaceful approach to outer space. But I do think\nwe can learn a lot from asking whether it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nRubenstein advances this thought experiment through Rolston\u2019s framework of\necological justice, which broadens the familiar opposition between subjective\nand objective \u2014 in short, human beings acting on the world \u2014 by adding a third\ncategory: \u201cprojective.\u201d In the subject\u2013object duality, subjects are free to\nact upon objects. But there are also \u201cnatural entities that have their own\nvalue independently of anything humans might want from them,\u201d and they need to\nbe regarded as such, Rubenstein argues. Space, she writes, belongs to this\nthird, projective, category: \u201cProjects include not only animals, vegetables,\nand microbes but also lakes and rivers, moons and stars.\u201d Planets, stars, and\nother heavenly bodies have intrinsic integrity, rather than being merely\nobjects that exist to be used by human subjects.\n\nLike Rubenstein, Moriba Jah also draws inspiration from indigenous peoples\nseeking to live in harmony with creation, preferring ideas of stewardship and\necological management to ownership. He suggests seeing space as an independent\necosystem with the capacity to teach habits for conservation, stating in a\nrecent lecture at M.I.T., \u201cMother Nature is so resilient, if we allow her to\nshow us the way. These are principles of traditional ecological knowledge.\u201d\nFor Jah, everything in the universe is interconnected, a reality that invites\nhumanity to approach outer space with humility and gratitude, even empathy.\n\nAs a philosophical approach, \u201cspace is for space\u201d has its benefits. If space\nis indeed an independent entity with inherent worth, human beings ought to\ntake greater pains to care for it, which would at the very least prevent our\nabuse of it. Jah\u2019s own research aims at charting the location of space junk to\nprevent damage to the satellites that provide valuable services to people,\nincluding television, cellphone, and GPS signals. But more than that, \u201cspace\nis for space\u201d helps explain the mythic power of the celestial realm that we\nintuitively sense when we see deep space photographs of ancient nebulae: that\nouter space has value beyond its material contents.\n\nEven a celestial body as ordinary as the Moon possesses an entrancing\nmystique. The 2018 film First Man brilliantly captures this lunar majesty in\none breathtaking scene. After minutes of stressed, strained, cramped close-ups\nof the astronauts struggling to land safely, the camera makes a dramatic\nshift. Once Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) opens the door, the lunar landscape\nis filmed on sweeping, seventy-millimeter IMAX film. The effect is stirring.\nCompared to the claustrophobia of the lunar lander, the Moon is gorgeous,\nserene, and expansive. Viewing this magisterial landscape, Robert Zubrin\u2019s\nassertion in a 2020 National Review article that \u201cclearly the Moon is a dead\nrock\u201d rings hollow.\n\nAt the same time, \u201cspace is for space\u201d is not the complete picture.\nRubenstein\u2019s defense of space reads like a patchwork of environmentalism plus\nindigenous mysticism plus postmodern pantheism, more a collection of\ninteresting ideas than an integrated philosophical worldview. In the end,\n\u201cspace is for space\u201d fails to provide a coherent and positive framework for\nhow we should respond to our longing for space. There is a palpable sense of\nloss, even resignation, as these writers uphold the vast Otherness of space\nwithout real guidance for experiencing it. After decrying Mars as a \u201chellhole\u201d\nin The Atlantic, science writer Shannon Stirone still admits that \u201cwalking\naround on Mars would be a life-changing, amazing, profound experience,\u201d though\nliving there permanently \u201cwill kill you.\u201d Rubenstein admits that the Apollo\nmissions were \u201cthrilling,\u201d even if they were, in her view, \u201creplay[ing] the\nChristian imperialism that founded and expanded the US.\u201d\n\nThese confessions reveal a perplexing truth: the dignity of space is precisely\nwhat makes space so desirable. We don\u2019t, in fact, want to leave space alone.\nIt would be a loss of spiritual proportion to simply give up. \u201cSpace is for\nus\u201d articulates this desire: we want space. \u201cSpace is for space\u201d tells us why:\nspace is sacred. It throbs with a special power that calls out to us like no\nother. On the map of space-meaning, these positions are like two coordinates,\npointing toward the missing third piece: relationship with the sacred.\n\n##### \u2018Space Is for Divine Communion\u2019\n\nThink again about the majestic enigma of the night sky, an expanse that both\nhumbles and exhilarates. The best accounting for this mesmerizing experience\nis that outer space is a sacred space that invites communion with the Divine.\n\nWith science as secularized as it is today, this claim may feel radical. But\nit echoes what has been said throughout human history. We have long associated\nouter space with divine presence. The aboriginal Yol\u014bu people view outer space\nas an interconnected layer of this world, called Sky Country: the place where\nthe ancestors live, giving an intimate connection to past generations. In\nOsage religious mythology, the first peoples were originally spirit beings in\nthe sky, who came to earth with guidance from the sun. Upon death, their\nwarriors were presented to the sun so that their spirits could return\nheavenward. We could add to these examples numerous others from Egyptian,\nGreek, and Roman mythologies, where the cosmos, and the high peaks of the\nearth stretching into the skies, was the home of the gods.\n\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nGlobal polytheistic cosmologies agree that the heavens are the realm of the\nDivine. The Shinto religion worships the Sun Goddess, one of the highest\ndeities and the mother of the Japanese emperors. Taoist rituals aim to create\nsacred space on earth to connect us with the heavenly realm. Hindu theology\nhas a rich engagement with space, teaching that the universe was created by\nBrahma as an extension of himself, giving the heavens a sacred quality, while\nBrahma himself lives in another cosmic, planet-like sphere named Brahmaloka.\nOne sacred text even recounts an interdimensional journey of the Hindu King\nKakudmi, traveling to Brahmaloka to consult with Brahma himself (and learning\nsome advanced astrophysics along the way).\n\nThe great monotheistic traditions also view the heavens as sacred space. In\nthe Bible, Psalm 19:1 announces that \u201cthe heavens declare the glory of God,\nand the sky above proclaims his handiwork.\u201d In the Quran, Surah 16:12 teaches\n\u201cHe has subjected for you the night and day and the sun and moon, and the\nstars are subjected by His command. Indeed in that are signs for people who\nreason.\u201d While differing with their polytheistic neighbors on whether the\nheavenly bodies should themselves be worshipped, the great monotheistic\nreligions affirm the common truth: outer space is sacred space.\n\nAnd as sacred space, outer space offers an unparalleled venue for encountering\nthe Divine. To borrow a concept from Celtic spirituality, sacred spaces are\n\u201cthin places\u201d where \u201cthe distance between heaven and earth shrinks, and time\nand eternity embrace,\u201d as theologian Timothy George has written. In these thin\nplaces, humans find themselves enrapt in a spiritual encounter with what\nphilosopher of religion Rudolf Otto termed \u201cthe Numinous.\u201d In his studies on\nreligious experience, Otto discerned that when humans met the Divine \u2014 a\nnuminous, radically-other presence \u2014 they described their experience as\nsimultaneously humbling and enlivening, producing the complex sensations of\nsmallness, dread, and awe combined with fascination, exuberance, and joy. In\nthese moments, \u201cthe mysterious is already beginning to loom before the mind,\nto touch the feelings,\u201d rendering a truly \u201cbeatific experience,\u201d Otto wrote.\nThis is divine communion: an exalted encounter with the numinous presence in a\nthin place. This is also what makes outer space so enthralling, and explains\nits universal draw. Outer space is numinous space, a sacred space of immediate\nspiritual encounter. Of all the thin places in our world, space is perhaps the\nthinnest.\n\nHuman space travelers confirm this, routinely recalling a singularly\ntranscendent experience as they view Earth from the vastness of space. Some\nhighlight the fragility of humanity compared to the coldness of the cosmic\nabyss. Upon his return to Earth after a Blue Origin space flight in 2022,\nactor William Shatner broke down in tears, reporting that he had experienced\none of \u201cthe strongest feelings of grief I have ever encountered.\u201d Others\nreport a distaste for nationalism and warfare, with increased sympathy for the\nunity of humankind. Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins captures this when he\nwrites,\n\n> I really believe that if the political leaders of the world could see their\n> planet from a distance of, let\u2019s say, 100,000 miles, their outlook could be\n> fundamentally changed. That all-important border would be invisible, that\n> noisy argument suddenly silenced. The tiny globe would continue to turn,\n> serenely ignoring its subdivisions, presenting a unified fa\u00e7ade that would\n> cry out for unified understanding, for homogeneous treatment. The earth must\n> become as it appears.\n\nSome recall a spiritual exuberance brought about by seeing the beauty of the\nEarth from this privileged vantage, reveling in what astronaut Terry Virts\ndescribes as the \u201cbizarre and exotic colors that God must have saved on his\npalette for some very special places.\u201d Others appreciate the untranslatable\nsense of mystery. Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, writes,\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s natural to try to liken space flight to familiar experiences, it\ncan\u2019t be brought \u2018down to Earth.\u2019 The environment is different; the\nperspective is different. Part of the fascination with space travel is the\nelement of the unknown \u2014 the conviction that it\u2019s different from Earthbound\nexperiences. And it is.\u201d Many have called this the \u201coverview effect.\u201d Otto\nwould call it a divine encounter.\n\nThe Apollo 11 mission provides a succinct case study of divine communion in\nouter space, as all three men reported some form of numinous encounter. On the\nsurface of the Moon, Buzz Aldrin prepared for his lunar walk by pausing for\nprayer and taking Holy Communion. He later wrote,\n\n> We had come to the moon in the name of all mankind \u2014 be they Christians,\n> Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists. But at the time I could\n> think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo 11\n> experience than by giving thanks to God.\n\n#### Humane dissent from technocracy\n\nExhausted by science and tech debates that go nowhere?\n\nWe offer a richer science journalism\n\nFirst Man Neil Armstrong had a different but equally profound experience. He\nhas been quoted as saying, \u201cIt suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty\nand blue, was the earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb\nblotted out the planet earth. I didn\u2019t feel like a giant. I felt very, very\nsmall.\u201d Meanwhile, with Armstrong and Aldrin down on the lunar surface, pilot\nMichael Collins grappled with an unparalleled aloneness, circling solo in the\ncommand module, cut off from radio contact with Earth \u2014 one man, floating\nalone in space, on the dark side of the Moon. He described the experience like\nthis: \u201cI am alone now, truly alone, and absolutely isolated from any known\nlife. I am it.... I feel this powerfully \u2014 not as fear or loneliness \u2014 but as\nawareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation.\u201d\n\nAwe, humility, perspective, transformation \u2014 these are the hallmarks of a\ndivine encounter in a sacred space. You don\u2019t even need to go to space to have\nyour senses sparked by an encounter with the Numinous. An evening with a\ntelescope, or an outing to a planetarium, or an afternoon perusing space\npictures can provide a similar experience of transcendence. As Neil\nArmstrong\u2019s character, played by Ryan Gosling in First Man, puts it, space\nexploration \u201callows us to see things that maybe we should\u2019ve seen a long time\nago, but just haven\u2019t been able to until now.\u201d This is the beauty and promise\nof space in full: a chance to enter the heavens and experience divine\ncommunion.\n\n##### \u2018By the Stars, We Hope\u2019\n\nThis theocentric account of outer space both chastens and completes what is\nimplicit in the other two, and it offers the inspiration to renew our vision\nfor space exploration in an age where we ask yet again, despite all the urgent\nproblems that need solving in the world: Why space? As Kendrick Oliver\nobserves in his book To Touch the Face of God: The Sacred, the Profane, and\nthe American Space Program, 1957\u20131975, \u201cWhen religion was present [in the\nApollo program], its presence meant more, to more people, than it did in any\nother national undertaking of the time.\u201d Far from imposing a religious,\noutdated worldview on a purely scientific undertaking, theocentric space-\nmeaning offers deep, spiritual purpose to our journey to the stars.\n\nTheocentric space-meaning amplifies the riches of our cosmological studies.\nOur ancestors knew well that there is wisdom to be gained by studying the\nwonders of space, beyond mere scientific knowledge. As sacred space, outer\nspace offers a satisfying synthesis of science and spirituality, and the more\nwe learn, the more wonderful the mysteries become. As Pope Benedict XVI\nwrites, \u201cPhysics and biology, and the natural sciences in general, have given\nus a new and unheard-of creation account with vast new images, which let us\nrecognize the face of the Creator.\u201d These theological lessons offer a hopeful\nvision of reality: \u201cThe universe is not the product of darkness and unreason.\nIt comes from intelligence, freedom, and from the beauty that is identical\nwith love.\u201d We can lean into outer space with a listening ear and open heart,\nseeking spiritual as well as scientific enlightenment.\n\nSimilarly, theocentric space-meaning helps direct our efforts at space\nconservation. We can applaud efforts to reduce space junk and minimize our\nbiological impact on other planets. We can ask hard questions about resources\nand the environment, because space is not simply there for the taking. It is a\ntranscendent gift to be stewarded. And, lest we believe that stewardship\ncannot provide reason enough for heroic human effort, we need only remember\nhow vigorously people strain to protect what they view as sacred. The\nMaccabean warrior-priests, who gave their lives to purge the Jewish temple of\npagan desolation in the second century b.c., demonstrate that protection of\nthe sacred can inspire the greatest acts of courage, discipline, sacrifice,\nand strength. Applied to outer space, conservation and protection can be\ninspiring and noble callings that engender great purpose and ingenuity, once\nwe fully embrace outer space as sacred space.\n\nTheocentric space-meaning also offers a profound vision for human space\nexploration: spiritual pilgrimage in a sacred wilderness. To heed an Arabic\nproverb, taken from Belden Lane\u2019s The Solace of Fierce Landscapes, \u201cThe\nfurther you go into the desert, the closer you come to God.\u201d In its fullness\nand beauty, its emptiness and harshness, outer space provides a vast sacred\nwilderness for transcendent experience, not only inviting but requiring human\nparticipation.\n\nThis brings our quest for space-meaning full circle. Why should human beings\nexplore space? Because space offers transcendence from which only human beings\ncan benefit. The James Webb Space Telescope cannot articulate awe. A robot\ncannot go into the deep and come back with soulful renewal. To fully\nappreciate space, we need people to go there and embrace it for what it fully\nis. Space is not merely for humans, nor is space merely for space. Space is\nfor divine communion. \u201cCreation exists for the sake of worship,\u201d writes Pope\nBenedict. Or, as Becky Chambers writes at the beginning of her space opera,\nThe Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet:\n\n> From the ground, we stand; From our ships, we live; By the stars, we hope.\n\n#### Topics\n\n  * Faith and Science\n  * NASA\n  * Beyond Earth\n\nLink copied to clipboard!\n\nSubscriber Only\n\nSign in or Subscribe Now for access to PDF downloads\n\nWilliam Boyce is lead pastor of Christ Church of Arlington, Virginia.\n\nWilliam Boyce, \u201cWhat Is Space For?,\u201d The New Atlantis, Number 75, Winter 2024,\npp. 45\u201360.\n\nHeader Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nEssay\n\nWinter 2024\n\n#### Topics\n\n  * Faith and Science\n  * NASA\n  * Beyond Earth\n\nLink copied to clipboard!\n\nSubscriber Only\n\nSign in or Subscribe Now for access to PDF downloads\n\n##### Related\n\nWinter 2004\n\n##### The Human Explorer\n\nWhy sending robots is not enough\n\nRobert Zubrin\n\nFall 2003\n\n##### A New Vision for NASA\n\nThe trouble with NASA and the need for space exploration\n\nAdam Keiper\n\nFall 2007\n\n##### Thumos in Space\n\nCharles T.
