They report that with AI, imaging is 100 times faster and improves\nimage contrast 3.5-fold. The advance, they say, will provide researchers with\na better tool to evaluate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other\nretinal diseases.\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence helps overcome a key limitation of imaging cells in\nthe retina, which is time,\u201d said Johnny Tam, Ph.D., who leads the Clinical and\nTranslational Imaging Section at NIH's National Eye Institute.\n\nTam is developing a technology called adaptive optics (AO) to improve imaging\ndevices based on optical coherence tomography (OCT). Like ultrasound, OCT is\nnoninvasive, quick, painless, and standard equipment in most eye clinics.\n\n\u201cAdaptive optics takes OCT-based imaging to the next level,\u201d said Tam. \u201cIt\u2019s\nlike moving from a balcony seat to a front row seat to image the retina. With\nAO, we can reveal 3D retinal structures at cellular-scale resolution, enabling\nus to zoom in on very early signs of\n\nWhile adding AO to OCT provides a much better view of cells, processing AO-OCT\nimages after they\u2019ve been captured takes much longer than OCT without AO.\n\nIllustration of the eye showing the location of the retina and its retinal\npigment epithelium (RPE).NEI\n\nTam\u2019s latest work targets the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a layer of\ntissue behind the light-sensing retina that supports the metabolically active\nretinal neurons, including the photoreceptors. The retina lines the back of\nthe eye and captures, processes, and converts the light that enters the front\nof the eye into signals that it then transmits through the optic nerve to the\nbrain. Scientists are interested in the RPE because many diseases of the\nretina occur when the RPE breaks down.\n\nImaging RPE cells with AO-OCT comes with new challenges, including a\nphenomenon called speckle. Speckle interferes with AO-OCT the way clouds\ninterfere with aerial photography. At any given moment, parts of the image may\nbe obscured. Managing speckle is somewhat similar to managing cloud cover.\nResearchers repeatedly image cells over a long period of time. As time passes,\nthe speckle shifts, which allows different parts of the cells to become\nvisible. The scientists then undertake the laborious and time-consuming task\nof piecing together many images to create an image of the RPE cells that's\nspeckle-free.\n\nA top-down view of lab-grown RPE cells as seen with high-resolution\nmicroscopy. Unlike AO-OCT, which is performed in an awake person, this image\nwas created with preserved tissue. NEI\n\nTam and his team developed a novel AI-based method called parallel\ndiscriminator generative adversarial network (P-GAN)\u2014a deep learning\nalgorithm. By feeding the P-GAN network nearly 6,000 manually analyzed AO-OCT-\nacquired images of human RPE, each paired with its corresponding speckled\noriginal, the team trained the network to identify and recover speckle-\nobscured cellular features.\n\nWhen tested on new images, P-GAN successfully de-speckled the RPE images,\nrecovering cellular details. With one image capture, it generated results\ncomparable to the manual method, which required the acquisition and averaging\nof 120 images. With a variety of objective performance metrics that assess\nthings like cell shape and structure, P-GAN outperformed other AI techniques.\nVineeta Das, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in the Clinical and Translational\nImaging Section at NEI, estimates that P-GAN reduced imaging acquisition and\nprocessing time by about 100-fold. P-GAN also yielded greater contrast, about\n3.5 greater than before.\n\nBy integrating AI with AO-OCT, Tam believes that a major obstacle for routine\nclinical imaging using AO-OCT has been overcome, especially for diseases that\naffect the RPE, which has traditionally been difficult to image.\n\n\u201cOur results suggest that AI can fundamentally change how images are\ncaptured,\u201d said Tam. \u201cOur P-GAN artificial intelligence will make AO imaging\nmore accessible for routine clinical applications and for studies aimed at\nunderstanding the structure, function, and pathophysiology of blinding retinal\ndiseases. Thinking about AI as a part of the overall imaging system, as\nopposed to a tool that is only applied after images have been captured, is a\nparadigm shift for the field of AI.\u201d\n\nMore news from the NEI Clinical and Translational Imaging Section.\n\nThis press release describes a basic research finding. Basic research\nincreases our understanding of human behavior and biology, which is\nfoundational to advancing new and better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat\ndisease. Science is an unpredictable and incremental process\u2014 each research\nadvance builds on past discoveries, often in unexpected ways. Most clinical\nadvances would not be possible without the knowledge of fundamental basic\nresearch.
