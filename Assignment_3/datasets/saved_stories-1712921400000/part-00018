Hundreds of millions of\ndollars.\n\nImagine a football stadium filled to the brim with avocados, and it still\nwouldn\u2019t represent the number eaten at this year\u2019s Super Bowl.\n\nAmericans put away 250m pounds of avocados this year, up from 100m ten years\nago, and 43.8m ten years before that.\n\nOnce known as an alligator pear, the avocado has sailed to prominence on the\nInstagram feeds of wellness influencers everywhere.\n\nThe fruit\u2019s surge has been anything but organic. It got an unlikely assist\nfrom a postman, the NFL, and a mascot named Mr. Ripe Guy.\n\n#### Alligator skin\n\nLong a mainstay of Mexican cuisine, avocados didn\u2019t make it to the US until\nthe early 1900s.\n\nBut they were hard to come by, and expensive. Luxury hotels in New York and\nSan Francisco were paying $1, roughly $25 today, per fruit to import them.\nTheir name back then \u2014 alligator pear \u2014 didn\u2019t help matters.\n\nOlivia Heller\n\n\u201cThat the avocado, an exalted member of the laurel family, should be called an\nalligator pear is beyond all understanding,\u201d wrote the California Avocado\nGrowers\u2019 Exchange trade group in 1927.\n\nThey decided on a smoother name: avocado, derived from the Aztec word\n\u201cahuacacacuahatl\u201d (or \u201ctesticle tree,\u201d in more direct translation).\n\nA California advertisement soon declared them \u201cthe aristocrat of salad fruit.\u201d\n\nShortly after, a postman and amateur farmer bought a 50-cent bag of avocado\nseeds from a local grower. Rudolph Hass planted them in sawdust-filled apple\nboxes in a grove in La Habra Heights, and waited as one persnickety baby tree\nrefused to graft.\n\nHass wanted to graft the seedling to grow an avocado variety called the\nFuerte, but instead it sprouted fruit of a different kind: an avocado with\ndark, pebbly skin.\n\nThe avocados started winning blue ribbons at the state fair, and Hass\u2019s kids\nloved their buttery, nutty flavor.\n\nHass realized his horticultural project had borne fruit (sorry). He filed for,\nand received, one of the country\u2019s first plant patents, and cut a deal with a\nnearby grower who\u2019d give him 25% of any Hass avocados sold. At the time, he\ncalled the discovery an act of God.\n\nThe original Hass avocado patent, plant patent number 139. (United States\nPatent and Trademark Office)\n\nBut his love for avocados was ahead of its time. Hass made only about $4k from\nhis share of the crops, and worked as a postman till his death at age 60. His\npatent expired the same year.\n\n\u201cFor every tree that was sold, my dad got a dollar,\u201d Rudolph\u2019s son Charlie\nHass told the Ventura County Star before he died. \u201cThat amounted to less than\n$4,000 over the life of the patent. It\u2019s amazing how many people, when they\nfind out I\u2019m associated with it, assume I made a lot of money from it.\u201d\n\nBecause of the rules governing patents at the time, there was nothing the\nfamily could have done to extend their ownership of the strain, whose sales\nnow total $2.7B.\n\nBut by the \u201960s, thanks to its size, texture, and stability en route, the Hass\nwas quickly surpassing another variety, the Fuerte, as the avocado of choice\non the West Coast.\n\nOutside of California and Florida, though, it wasn\u2019t that simple.\n\nDecades later, foodies are still trying to make avocado ice cream happen.\n(Getty Images)\n\n\u201cAvocados: Almost Perfect Food Not Just for Salads,\u201d pleaded one 1968\nheadline. \u201cYou\u2019d think the avocado was some kind of strange foreign critter\nthe way some folks treat it,\u201d wrote a Palm Beach writer in 1969.\n\nGrowers\u2019 associations published recipe booklets (avocado fritters, avocado ice\ncream), but still the public\u2019s attention didn\u2019t catch.\n\nFor one, the fruit was ugly, and grew uglier as it ripened. And for two, it\nwas complicated. You couldn\u2019t eat it like an apple. You couldn\u2019t peel it like\nan orange. You needed a knife, a dextrous set of fingers, and considerable\npatience.\n\nAvocados had a branding problem.\n\n#### Humanizing a fruit\n\nBonnie Goodman didn\u2019t eat avocados growing up. Back then, she was an East\nCoast kid in Philadelphia, and the fruit wasn\u2019t carried at local grocery\nstores. \u201cMy mother wasn\u2019t buying avocados,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen she moved to California, she got more familiar with the round green orbs.\nStill, she never imagined her PR career would lead her to a farmers market,\nstanding next to a colleague in a sweaty avocado costume.\n\nEnter Mr. Ripe Guy, a squishy, scaly, human-turned-avocado mascot and\nbrainchild of the team at powerhouse PR agency Hill & Knowlton.\n\nThe agency ran ads in newspapers across the country, and eventually narrowed\ntheir search to five contenders they presented at a farmers market in\nCalifornia. (Texas History archive)\n\nGoodman, then senior vice president at Hill & Knowlton and now senior VP at\nLA\u2019s The Music Center, oversaw the team hired by the California Avocado\nCommission to supercharge the avocado\u2019s growth. Playing with viral marketing\nbefore viral marketing was a thing, the team bandied ideas around.\n\n\u201cWe tried to, from a marketing standpoint, humanize the fruit, so people felt\nmore comfortable,\u201d she says.\n\nThe team took advantage of anything green. St. Patty\u2019s Day at local bars? Send\nin Mr. Ripe Guy, and see if he makes the news.\n\nAnd then one of the team members had another idea. What if Mr. Ripe Guy was\nlonely? Why not look across the States and see about finding Mr. Ripe Guy a\ngirlfriend?\n\n\u201cWe did a search, as a total stunt,\u201d Goodman says.\n\n#### A Super-Bowl-sized assist\n\nThe winner, a 26-year-old Chicagoan named Robyn Nardone, won a guest spot on\nBaywatch spinoff Baywatch Nights and lifelong bragging rights.\n\nAt the same time, the PR team saw another opportunity. They weren\u2019t the ones\nwho suggested consumers eat guac on Super Bowl Sunday, but they decided to\ncapitalize on it.\n\nEnlisting the help of the NFL and some of its players, the team introduced the\nGuacamole Bowl, sharing recipes from players and their families, and asking\nthe public to crown a winner.\n\nBefore long, the Super Bowl surpassed even Cinco de Mayo (81m pounds) in the\nnumber of avocados eaten.\n\nNot long after, the US government lifted its import restrictions on Mexican\navocados, and suddenly there were enough avocados to whet appetites across the\ncountry.\n\nOlivia Heller\n\nIn 2000, the government went a step further and passed a law to create a\npromotional program to further boost domestic consumption. By then, sales in\nCalifornia had already spiked 70%.\n\nToday, 80% of avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico, and 95% of them\nbear the name of Hass, the California postman. (The Hass mother tree itself\nsuccumbed to root rot in 2002, but has been regrafted and grown all over the\nworld countless times over.)\n\nAnd while Hass, the postman, never got to reap the benefits of his creation\u2019s\nposthumous pop-off, his family\u2019s quiet legacy lives on in nearly every US\ngrocery store.\n\n#### That\u2019s marketing\n\nThe avocado surge has come with costs: environmental, as the increase in\nproduction has led to ravaged forests, water shortages, and even small\nearthquakes. And criminal, as cartel violence ramps up against farmers in\nMexico. (Two years ago, the US banned imports temporarily after an inspector\nwas threatened in the Mexican state of Michoacan, where half the world\u2019s\nglobal avocado supply is grown.)\n\nStill, avocado growers and their backers are pouring money into ensuring the\nfruit stays top-of-grocery-list. The California Avocado Commission\u2019s latest\ngoal? To make the fruit America\u2019s favorite by 2025.\n\nOlivia Heller\n\nAs we chat, Goodman looks down at her desk and notices that a photo of her\ndaughter also shows Mr. Ripe Guy, standing behind her, a symbol of the fruit\u2019s\nubiquity and the role she played in it.\n\n\u201cToday when I go to Trader Joe\u2019s, I\u2019m constantly reminded of the fact that we\nhelped put this fruit on the map,\u201d Goodman says.\n\n\u201cWe had fun, people had fun along with us, and that\u2019s why it kept going. We\ngot to look at things in less traditional ways, and I think that\u2019s how we\nbroke through,\u201d Goodman says. \u201cThat\u2019s marketing, right?\u201d\n\nTopics: Agriculture Food\n\n## Follow us on social media\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * ### How One Professor\u2019s Lecture Launched a Food Movement\n\nSep 19, 2020\n\n  * ### How We Launched a Physical Product in 3 Months\n\nSep 19, 2020\n\n  * ### Did SunnyD really turn a girl orange?\n\nMar 22, 2024\n\n  * ### The curious case of the disappearing Hydrox cookies\n\nJan 08, 2024\n\n  * ### Why the world\u2019s best vanilla is so easy to steal\n\nAug 15, 2023\n\n  * ### How nuns got squeezed out of the communion wafer business\n\nJul 21, 2023\n\n  * ### How One Professor\u2019s Lecture Launched a Food Movement\n\nSep 19, 2020\n\n  * ### How We Launched a Physical Product in 3 Months\n\nSep 19, 2020\n\n  * ### Did SunnyD really turn a girl orange?\n\nMar 22, 2024\n\n  * ### The curious case of the disappearing Hydrox cookies\n\nJan 08, 2024\n\n## Get Smarter on Business and Tech Thanks for subscribing!\n\nGet the 5-minute newsletter keeping 2M+ innovators in the loop.\n\nWant even more business resources?
