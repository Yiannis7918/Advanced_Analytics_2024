It combines bark from timber production, used coffee grounds and other\nbio-based materials to create sheets and granules/pellets that can be used by\npackaging manufacturers to create a variety of materials.\n\nAs it is currently filing patents, the company remains tight-lipped about its\nproduction process, but says it doesn\u2019t involve solvents: \u201cThe production\nprocess starts with compounding, followed by the creation of pellets or\nsheets, and concludes with the casting of solid packaging, which takes place\neither by injection molding or thermoforming.\u201d\n\nThe resulting biodegradable material can handle high-moisture products but\n\u201cshould fully decompose in moist soil within one to two months,\u201d claims the\ncompany. \u201cIt is 100% home-compostable.\u201d\n\nAccording to Skalkin: \u201cTraditional bio packaging often struggles to compete\nwith its plastic counterparts in terms of pricing and integration complexity.\nOur bio-based plastic substitute can be manufactured using existing plastic\nproduction equipment, eliminating the need for plastic factories to purchase\nnew equipment.\n\n\u201cMoreover, our packaging is 100% bio-based, with up to 75% of materials\nsourced from production waste [such as bark and used coffee grounds],\u201d noted\nSkalkin, who said annual bark production was estimated to be between 300 and\n400 million m3.\n\nBpacks cofounder and CEO Mikhail Skalkin: \u2018Our packaging is 100% bio-based,\nwith up to 75% of materials sourced from production waste.\u2019 Image credit:\nBpacks\n\n#### \u2018The majority of bark ends up as waste. We are giving it a new life\u2019\n\nCurrently, Bpacks head of innovation Dr. Aleksandra Ne\u0161i\u0107 told AgFunderNews,\nmost biodgradable bioplastics are made from agricultural feedstocks such as\ncorn, soybeans, sugarcane or brewery residues to create materials such as\npolylactic acids (PLAs), or in some cases wood pulp from the paper industry to\ncreate cellulose-based products.\n\n\u201cIn the rigid packaging industry, PLA is the most used, but cellulose based\npackaging is also coming back to the market because some products cannot be\npacked in PLA and for some products it is too expensive.\n\n\u201cOther [bioplastics] such as PBAT [Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate from\nsugarcane or cornstarch] or PHAs [Polyhydroxyalkanoates made via microbial\nfermentation with various sugary feedstocks] are out there but in very low\namounts.\u201d\n\nBark, she said, \u201cis a massively underutilized natural resource and it\u2019s almost\nfree as a raw material. Some of it is utilized for extracts because it has\nsome interesting properties [anti-microbial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,\nimmunomodulatory, astringent, anti-ulcer, and wound-healing properties],\nalthough those extractions typically require high amounts of harmful chemicals\nor petroleum-based chemicals.\n\n\u201cBut the majority ends up as waste. We are giving it a new life.\u201d\n\n#### Integration with existing infrastructure\n\nAccording to Bolshakov: \u201cThere are plenty of bio-based packaging solutions out\nthere but cost and scale is an issue and some of them face integration\nchallenges [to fit into existing infrastructure for packaging materials\nproduction]. We\u2019re introducing a new technology that integrates with current\nequipment. So if a manufacturing company wants to replace its plastic pellets,\nthis can be done easily and seamlessly with our granules.\n\n\u201cOur lab has limited capacity but we can also license our technology [to\nmanufacture the granules] to plastic packaging companies. It doesn\u2019t require\nexpensive bespoke equipment, so existing production equipment can be used.\u201d\n\nProperties of the material can be tuned both by altering the ratios of the\ningredients used in the 100% bio-based formulation, but also by altering the\nprocess parameters, said Bolshakov, who said the company has thus far been\nfunded by the founders\u2019 capital and a small group of private investors.\n\n#### Extending shelf-life\n\nBpacks\u2019 packaging is ideal for fruits and vegetables and meats, where internal\ntesting shows it can extend shelf-life thanks to its anti-microbial\nproperties, added Bolshakov, who is now validating this via testing at\nindependent third-party labs.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe increase in shelf-life is a key advantage to potential\ncustomers, plus we think we can be competitive with petroleum-based products.\u201d\n\nBpacks combines bark from timber production, used coffee grounds and other\nbio-based materials to make pellets that can be used by packaging\nmanufacturers to create a variety of biodegradable rigid packaging materials.\nImage credit: Bpacks\n\nAccording to Precedence Research, bioplastics currently make up less than 1%\nof the global plastics market, but are expected to grow significantly in the\ncoming years as firms are under increasing pressure to reduce their carbon\nfootprint and meet legislative requirements. In 2021, the global bioplastics\nmarket size was estimated at $11.2 billion, and it is projected to reach $46.1\nbillion by 2030.\n\n  * biomaterials, bioplastics, serbia, sustainable packaging, UK\n\n## Join the Newsletter\n\n## Get the latest news & research from AFN and AgFunder in your inbox.\n\nPrevPreviousMeet the founder: \u2018You cannot be green if you\u2019re in the red\u2019 when\nit comes to financing regen ag, says Agreena\u2019s Simon Haldrup\n\nNextHow HeavyFinance plans to finance the regen ag transition for more of\nEurope\u2019s small and medium farmersNext\n\n### Related Stories\n\n## Q&A: Biomaterials startups are \u2018not necessarily configured for venture\ncapital,\u2019 says GANNI co-founder\n\n## New report: Agrifoodtech startup investment drops 50%, accounts for just\n5.5% of global VC dollars\n\n## Sponsored\n\n## The economy will tighten in 2024.
