As a representative, the Virginia Democrat leads a\nbipartisan group focused on promoting fusion energy. He reads books about\ngeometry for fun.\n\nSo when questions about regulating artificial intelligence emerged, the\n73-year-old Beyer took what for him seemed like an obvious step, enrolling at\nGeorge Mason University to get a master\u2019s degree in machine learning. In an\nera when lawmakers and Supreme Court justices sometimes concede they don\u2019t\nunderstand emerging technology, Beyer\u2019s journey is an outlier, but it\nhighlights a broader effort by members of Congress to educate themselves about\nartificial intelligence as they consider laws that would shape its\ndevelopment.\n\nFrightening to some, thrilling to others, baffling to many: Artificial\nintelligence has been called a transformative technology, a threat to\ndemocracy or even an existential risk for humanity. It will fall to members of\nCongress to figure out how to regulate the industry in a way that encourages\nits potential benefits while mitigating the worst risks.\n\nBut first they have to understand what AI is, and what it isn\u2019t.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nAmazon adds Andrew Ng, a leading voice in artificial intelligence, to its\nboard of directors\n\nConsumers would be notified of AI-generated content under Pennsylvania bill\n\nTech companies want to build artificial general intelligence. But who decides\nwhen AGI is attained?\n\n\u201cI tend to be an AI optimist,\u201d Beyer told The Associated Press following a\nrecent afternoon class on George Mason\u2019s campus in suburban Virginia. \u201cWe\ncan\u2019t even imagine how different our lives will be in five years, 10 years, 20\nyears, because of AI. ... There won\u2019t be robots with red eyes coming after us\nany time soon. But there are other deeper existential risks that we need to\npay attention to.\u201d\n\nRisks like massive job losses in industries made obsolete by AI, programs that\nretrieve biased or inaccurate results, or deepfake images, video and audio\nthat could be leveraged for political disinformation, scams or sexual\nexploitation. On the other side of the equation, onerous regulations could\nstymie innovation, leaving the U.S. at a disadvantage as other nations look to\nharness the power of AI.\n\nStriking the right balance will require input not only from tech companies but\nalso from the industry\u2019s critics, as well as from the industries that AI may\ntransform. While many Americans may have formed their ideas about AI from\nscience fiction movies like \u201cThe Terminator\u201d or \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d it\u2019s important\nthat lawmakers have a clear-eyed understanding of the technology, said Rep.\nJay Obernolte, R-Calif., and the chairman of the House\u2019s AI Task Force.\n\nWhen lawmakers have questions about AI, Obernolte is one of the people they\nseek out. He studied engineering and applied science at the California\nInstitute of Technology and earned an M.S. in artificial intelligence at UCLA.\nThe California Republican also started his own video game company. Obernolte\nsaid he\u2019s been \u201cvery pleasantly impressed\u201d with how seriously his colleagues\non both sides of the aisle are taking their responsibility to understand AI.\n\nThat shouldn\u2019t be surprising, Obernolte said. After all, lawmakers regularly\nvote on bills that touch on complicated legal, financial, health and\nscientific subjects. If you think computers are complicated, check out the\nrules governing Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nKeeping up with the pace of technology has challenged Congress since the steam\nengine and the cotton gin transformed the nation\u2019s industrial and agricultural\nsectors. Nuclear power and weaponry is another example of a highly technical\nsubject that lawmakers have had to contend with in recent decades, according\nto Kenneth Lowande, a University of Michigan political scientist who has\nstudied expertise and how it relates to policy-making in Congress.\n\nFederal lawmakers have created several offices \u2014 the Library of Congress, the\nCongressional Budget Office, etc. \u2014 to provide resources and specialized input\nwhen necessary. They also rely on staff with specific expertise on subject\ntopics, including technology.\n\nThen there\u2019s another, more informal form of education that many members of\nCongress receive.\n\n\u201cThey have interest groups and lobbyists banging down their door to give them\nbriefings,\u201d Lowande said.\n\nBeyer said he\u2019s had a lifelong interest in computers and that when AI emerged\nas a topic of public interest he wanted to know more. A lot more. Almost all\nof his fellow students are decades younger; most don\u2019t seem that fazed when\nthey discover their classmate is a congressman, Beyer said.\n\nHe said the classes, which he fits in around his busy congressional schedule \u2014\nare already paying off. He\u2019s learned about the development of AI and the\nchallenges facing the field. He said it\u2019s helped him understand the challenges\n\u2014 biases, unreliable data \u2014 and the possibilities, like improved cancer\ndiagnoses and more efficient supply chains.\n\nBeyer is also learning how to write computer code.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m finding that learning to code \u2014 which is thinking in this sort of\nmathematical, algorithmic step-by-step, is helping me think differently about\na lot of other things \u2014 how you put together an office, how you work a piece\nof legislation,\u201d Beyer said.\n\nWhile a computer science degree isn\u2019t required, it\u2019s imperative that lawmakers\nunderstand AI\u2019s implications for the economy, national defense, health care,\neducation, personal privacy and intellectual property rights, according to\nChris Pierson, CEO of the cybersecurity firm BlackCloak.\n\n\u201cAI is not good or bad,\u201d said Pierson, who formerly worked in Washington for\nthe Department of Homeland Security. \u201cIt\u2019s how you use it.\u201d\n\nThe work of safeguarding AI has already begun, though it\u2019s the executive\nbranch leading the way so far. Last month, the White House unveiled new rules\nthat require federal agencies to show their use of AI isn\u2019t harming the\npublic. Under an executive order issued last year, AI developers must provide\ninformation on the safety of their products.\n\nWhen it comes to more substantive action, America is playing catchup to the\nEuropean Union, which recently enacted the world\u2019s first significant rules\ngoverning the development and use of AI. The rules prohibit some uses \u2014\nroutine AI-enabled facial recognition by law enforcement, for one \u2014 while\nrequiring other programs to submit information about safety and public risks.\nThe landmark law is expected to serve as a blueprint for other nations as they\ncontemplate their own AI laws.\n\nAs Congress begins that process, the focus must be on \u201cmitigating potential\nharm,\u201d said Obernolte, who said he\u2019s optimistic that lawmakers from both\nparties can find common ground on ways to prevent the worst AI risks.\n\n\u201cNothing substantive is going to get done that isn\u2019t bipartisan,\u201d he said.\n\nTo help guide the conversation lawmakers created a new AI task force\n(Obernolte is co-chairman), as well as an AI Caucus made up of lawmakers with\na particular expertise or interest in the topic. They\u2019ve invited experts to\nbrief lawmakers on the technology and its impacts \u2014 and not just computer\nscientists and tech gurus either, but also representatives from different\nsectors that see their own risks and rewards in AI.\n\nRep. Anna Eshoo is the Democratic chairwoman of the caucus. She represents\npart of California\u2019s Silicon Valley and recently introduced legislation that\nwould require tech companies and social media platforms like Meta, Google or\nTikTok to identify and label AI-generated deepfakes to ensure the public isn\u2019t\nmisled. She said the caucus has already proved its worth as a \u201csafe place\u201d\nplace where lawmakers can ask questions, share resources and begin to craft\nconsensus.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a bad or silly question,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to understand\nsomething before you can accept or reject it.\u201d\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSuggested For You\n\nChallenger to the judge in Trump's 2020 Georgia election interference case is\ndisqualified\n\nUndo\n\nPro VerbraucherAd Content\n\nAdvertisement Bestatter packt aus: Anspruch auf Sterbegeld ist vielen\nunbekanntPro Verbraucher:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUndo\n\nA mom who threw two kids onto an LA freeway, killing her infant, appeared\nagitated by the impending eclipse\n\nUndo\n\nVietnam sentences real estate tycoon Truong My Lan to death in its largest-\never fraud case\n\nUndo\n\nJudge in Trump's election interference case rejects 'hostages' label for\njailed Jan. 6 defendants\n\nUndo\n\nSpeaker Johnson to meet with Trump, offers Marjorie Taylor Greene advisory\nrole as own job teetersWith his job on the line, House Speaker Mike Johnson is\ndashing to Florida to meet with Donald Trump this week.
