Source: CGTN\n\nChina\u2019s industrial \u201covercapacity\u201d is one of the most dominant issues in the\nworld at the moment. This week, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is warning\nChina against flooding the market with low-cost exports during a trip there.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sounded the alarm in a\nrecent speech that China\u2019s \u201covercapacities in protected industries are\nflooding global markets and can undermine our industrial base.\u201d\n\nBut the debate over \u201covercapacity\u201d reveals something much deeper. Let me\ndescribe two different visions of how the global economy should work, and tell\nme which resonates more with you.\n\n###\n\nVision 1: Finite demand and unfair competition\n\nGlobal demand for manufactured goods, such as cars and solar panels, may be\ngrowing over time, but it\u2019s limited. Each country that\u2019s able to produce these\ngoods at a decent level of quality and at a decent price should get a fair\nshot at getting a piece of the global production pie. This is important\nbecause there are jobs tied to this production. China\u2019s production of more\nthan its fair share of certain goods\u2014relying on unfair state support to drive\ndown prices\u2014is contributing to \u201covercapacity\u201d and preventing other countries\nfrom getting their fair share of the jobs associated with this production.\n\n###\n\nVision 2: Helping the world through global competition\n\nAll the talk about \u201covercapacity\u201d is overblown. When firms compete with each\nother globally to make products better and cheaper, everybody benefits.\nConsumers are the most obvious winners. But so are businesses that rely on\nthese products as inputs. If these goods are related to clean energy and can\nhelp reduce carbon emissions, that\u2019s a big win for the planet on climate\nchange. State support for domestic companies is not unfair; it\u2019s just another\nset of tools for raising competitiveness. Countries that are upset about\nChinese companies dominating their markets with better, cheaper products\nshould focus on making their own companies more competitive.\n\nGeely plant making Polestar EVs\n\n###\n\nWhat\u2019s missing in the debate about \u201covercapacity\u201d?\n\nLately, there\u2019s been a lot of good writing on Chinese \u201covercapacity.\u201d Lan\nXiaohuan at Fudan University and Yanmei Xie at Gavekal have argued separately\nthat overcapacity is a deliberate part of China\u2019s industrial strategy, geared\ntowards ramping up investment and stimulating competition. Mary Gallagher at\nthe University of Michigan shows how overcapacity is part of a broader style\nof Chinese governance that tends toward \u201cexcess capacity\u201d and overshooting\ntargets, from the Great Leap Forward to China\u2019s real estate boom.\n\nOther analysis has focused on overcapacity as a problem of supply and demand.\nA recent Rhodium Group report makes a distinction between the temporary\noversupply swings that are \u201ca normal part of market cycles\u201d versus a state-\ndriven \u201csystemic bias toward supporting producers rather than households or\nconsumers\u201d that causes an \u201cimbalance between domestic supply and demand.\u201d This\nimbalance, combined with China\u2019s current economic malaise, has led to\nquestions about whether China is trying to export its way out of its problems.\nZongyuan Zoe Liu at the Council on Foreign Relations and Michael Pettis at the\nCarnegie Endowment for International Peace have argued that China should focus\nmore on boosting domestic consumption rather than fueling overcapacity through\nmore investment.\n\nBut several important issues are being overlooked.\n\n####\n\n1\\. China itself pays a price for overcapacity.\n\nChina makes a gamble when it throws state support behind an industry. Chinese\ncompanies that receive state investments might not succeed and even go\nbankrupt. Fiscal resources might be wasted on supporting products that no one\nwants. State bank loans and other forms of financing might see little-to-no\nreturn on investment and be written off. China\u2019s state resources are finite,\nand there are significant risks and costs for China when it makes these kinds\nof bets. In retrospect, we see EVs and solar panels as obvious successes for\nChina. But there are plenty of areas of uncertainty where China\u2019s big,\nexpensive bets might not pan out, such as semiconductors and commercial jets.\n\nBoeing factory\n\n####\n\n2\\. Many countries besides China use state policies to support their own\nindustries.\n\nEvery country with a major automotive industry\u2014the US, Germany, Japan,\nIndia\u2014has strong state measures to protect their own domestic industries and\ntheir own auto-related manufacturing jobs. Boeing and Airbus have long\nreceived significant state support. The US Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s\npreferential treatment of American clean energy companies, particularly in EV\nmanufacturing, has provoked outcry from the EU, South Korea, and Japan. The EU\nhas already struck back with its own self-preferencing Green Deal Industrial\nPlan. The difference between China and other countries is a matter of scale:\nChina\u2019s industrial policy is far broader, deeper, and arguably more effective\nat generating domestic production capacity.\n\n####\n\n3\\. Why do countries have to produce as much as they consume?\n\nA lot of the arguments about China\u2019s overcapacity seem to assume that\ncountries should be producing at or below their level of consumption. But why\nshould this be the case at all? Saudi Arabia and Norway produce far more oil\nthan they consume. Likewise with American natural gas. Taiwan singlehandedly\nproduces more than half of the world\u2019s semiconductor chips. The idea of\nexporting goods to other countries\u2014goods that they want to buy voluntarily\u2014is\nsuddenly being talked about like its borderline criminal behavior. Part of\nthis is just a longer-standing gripe about China not consuming enough the way\nthat the US does, for example. The great irony is that as Western countries\nurge China to become more like them, they\u2019re becoming more like China.\n\n###\n\nIt\u2019s really about jobs and \u201cfairness\u201d\n\nSo the \u201covercapacity\u201d debate is not really about factory utilization rates or\nsupply-demand imbalances. It\u2019s about jobs and a sense of what\u2019s fair. That\u2019s\nVision 1 of the world.\n\nYou can tell it\u2019s really about jobs because the overcapacity issue only comes\nup for certain types of goods tied to certain types of jobs. Nobody in the US\nor Europe is accusing China of overcapacity in clothing or toy or smartphone\nmanufacturing because, frankly, Americans and Europeans don\u2019t want those kinds\nof low-skill, low-wage \u201csweatshop\u201d jobs\u2014and they like their cheap clothing.\n\nThe \u201cChina shock\u201d was a big deal not because manufacturing moved to China per\nse but because many \u201cgood jobs\u201d tied to manufacturing left the US. Remember:\nthe headlines about the original \u201cChina shock\u201d paper were all about the\nestimated loss of more than 2 million American manufacturing jobs due to\nimports from China. Biden and Trump both talk all the time about stemming the\nloss of jobs to China on the campaign trail. Now fears of a \u201csecond China\nshock\u201d are looming for the same reasons\u2014except this time it\u2019s the loss of\nadvanced manufacturing jobs and jobs tied to new, emerging industries that are\nat stake. Plus, the Chinese economy is just much bigger now, meaning that the\nimpact will be that much larger.\n\nChina Shock. Source: WSJ.\n\nSo while China\u2019s vision of the world is focused on the global competition over\ngoods, the rest of the world is focused on the global competition over good\njobs.\n\nThe question then becomes: who\u2019s getting the good jobs, and is it fair?\nIndeed, the issue of fairness comes up all the time. Biden used the phrase\n\u201cunfair economic practices\u201d when talking about China in his latest State of\nthe Union address. Janet Yellen used the same phrase several times in a recent\nspeech on China. Ursula von der Leyen, during a summit with Xi Jinping, said:\n\u201cPolitically, EU leaders will not be able to tolerate that our industrial base\nis undermined by unfair competition.\u201d (Of course, China is also trying to use\nthe same language, saying that a recent EU investigation into state support\nfor Chinese EV makers is \u201cunfair.\u201d)\n\n###\n\nChina\u2019s mistake is political\n\nChina views its industrial success as being the result of a superior system\nthat can integrate state coordination with the competitive forces of the\nmarket. (In the world of Chinese SOEs, I call this approach \u201cmanaged\ncompetition.\u201d) China doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s being unfair\u2014it\u2019s just better.\n\nOf course, the rest of the world doesn\u2019t see it that way. China is not only\nexplicitly trying to dominate critical industries, such as clean energy; it\u2019s\nalso bragging about it. This is part of a longer pattern of tin-ear\ngeopolitics where China doesn\u2019t seem to fully appreciate how much its\ncheerleading and boasting aimed at domestic audiences\u2014like talking up \u201cChina\u2019s\nmanufacturing prowess\u201d\u2014is angering foreign audiences and fueling a powerful\ngeopolitical backlash. The classic example of this is \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d\nChina\u2019s now infamous industrial policy plan targeting a set of strategic\nindustries, which has been widely cited by other countries as a reason to push\nback against China economically.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen giving a speech on China\n\nThere is some recognition of this problem within China. Two Peking University\neconomists, Huang Yiping and Lu Feng, have argued: \u201cWe need to take this\n[criticism] seriously. If a protectionist wave against Chinese products gained\nmomentum around the globe, then it would be detrimental to our development in\nthe next phase, especially in innovation.\u201d A recent high-level Chinese\ngovernment work report stated: \u201cWe will strengthen coordination, planning, and\ninvestment guidance for key sectors to prevent overcapacity and poor-quality,\nredundant development.\u201d But China needs to take real action.\n\n###\n\nWhat should China do?\n\nRather than simply pushing back more forcefully and asserting that its vision\nof the world is the right one, China needs to better appreciate the concerns\nof other countries and incorporate this into its policies. One way that China\ncan do better is to work with other countries to make sure they get a larger\nshare of the jobs associated with advanced manufacturing. China could do more\nto encourage its companies to set up plants abroad that provide jobs to\nworkers in those countries. Chinese firms are already starting to do this,\nlike BYD\u2019s factories in Hungary and Brazil. Chinese companies can also try to\npartner more with local firms in other countries, like SAIC is doing in India.\n\nUltimately, China might not believe that \u201cthe customer is always right.\u201d But\nin an age of greater economic nationalism and concern about China\u2019s actions,\nlistening to your customers and trying to really understand their point of\nview would be a wise first step.\n\nMore reading:\n\n  * Financial Times: Will Xi\u2019s manufacturing plan be enough to rescue China\u2019s economy?\n\n  * Bloomberg: Xi\u2019s Solution for China\u2019s Economy Risks Triggering New Trade War\n\n    * These are two of the best overviews of the overcapacity issue and its geopolitical backlash\n\n  * Lan Xiaohuan on China's Local Government Competition and Overcapacity\n\n    * An excerpt from Fudan University economist Lan Xiaohuan\u2019s book How China Works: An Introduction to China\u2019s State-led Economic Development\n\n  * The Economist: How Xi Jinping plans to overtake America\n\n    * A good overview of China\u2019s current industrial policy strategy\n\n### Subscribe to High Capacity\n\nBy Kyle Chan\n\nWriting about industrial policy, clean technology, EVs, infrastructure, and\ndevelopment, particularly in China and India.\n\n10 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n3 Restacks\n\n10\n\nShare this post\n\n#### China's \"overcapacity\" reveals two different visions of the world\n\nwww.high-capacity.com\n\n6\n\nShare\n\n6 Comments\n\nGlenn Lukreading, writing & investingApr 5Liked by Kyle ChanMy view is that\nthe biggest policy change China could do is simply allow the \u00a5 to strengthen.\nThe overall trade surplus (goods and services) is mainly a function of how\nstrong or weak a currency is.You're right - there is nothing wrong with\nexporting at a category level. But China is a magnet for blame when it is\nrunning ever-increasing trade surpluses, especially after the pandemic.This\ngoes to your point about creating jobs for others. One easy fix for China is\nto simply accelerate the process of shedding labor-intensive jobs \u2014 which\ngiven labor market dynamics and a shrinking workforce, they need to do anyway\nin the coming decades. Given wage levels, this will be mainly lower-wage\ndeveloping countries, although with a stronger \u00a5 this could also be higher-\nwage developed countries.Bringing the trade surplus back to zero will cause\npain but in the long run may be worth it for China. It won't eliminate all of\nthe criticism - after all, trade tensions rose even as China reduced its\ncurrent account deficit in both % and absolute terms after the GFC - but it\nwould have a positive effect on its trade relations with both the developed\nand developing world.Expand full commentLike (3)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n4 replies by Kyle Chan and others\n\nAbdul7 hrs agoExcellent article.
