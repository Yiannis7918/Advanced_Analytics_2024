Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace\nReport. I\u2019m Amy Goodman.\n\nThe Israeli publications +972 Magazine and Local Call have exposed how the\nIsraeli military used an artificial intelligence known as \u201cLavender\u201d to\ndevelop a \u201ckill list\u201d in Gaza that includes as many as 37,000 Palestinians who\nwere targeted for assassination with little human oversight. The report is\nbased in part on interviews with six Israeli intelligence officers who had\nfirsthand involvement with the AI system.\n\n+972 reports, quote, \u201cLavender has played a central role in the unprecedented\nbombing of Palestinians, especially during the early stages of the war. In\nfact, according to the sources, its influence on the military\u2019s operations was\nsuch that they essentially treated the outputs of the AI machine 'as if it\nwere a human decision.'\u201d\n\nA second AI system known as \u201cWhere\u2019s Daddy?\u201d tracked Palestinian men on the\nkill list. It was purposely designed to help Israel target individuals when\nthey were at home at night with their families. One intelligence officer told\nthe publications, quote, \u201cWe were not interested in killing operatives only\nwhen they were in a military building or engaged in a military activity. On\nthe contrary, the IDF bombed them in homes without hesitation, as a first\noption. It\u2019s much easier to bomb a family\u2019s home. The system is built to look\nfor them in these situations,\u201d they said.\n\nToday we spend the hour with the Israeli investigative journalist Yuval\nAbraham, who broke this story for +972 and Local Call. It\u2019s headlined\n\u201c'Lavender': The AI machine directing Israel\u2019s bombing spree in Gaza.\u201d I spoke\nwith Yuval Abraham yesterday and began by asking him to lay out what he found.\n\n> YUVAL ABRAHAM: Yeah. Thank you for having me again, Amy.\n\n> It is a very long piece. It\u2019s 8,000 words. And we divided it into six\n> different steps. And each step represents a process in the highly automated\n> way in which the military marks targets since October. And the first finding\n> is Lavender. So, Lavender was designed by the military. Its purpose was,\n> when it was being designed, to mark the low-ranking operatives in the Hamas\n> and Islamic Jihad military wings. That was the intention, because, you know,\n> Israel estimates that there are between 30,000 to 40,000 Hamas operatives,\n> and it\u2019s a very, very large number. And they understood that the only way\n> for them to mark these people is by relying on artificial intelligence. And\n> that was the intention.\n\n> Now, what sources told me is that after October 7th, the military basically\n> made a decision that all of these tens of thousands of people are now people\n> that could potentially be bombed inside their houses, meaning not only\n> killing them but everybody who\u2019s in the building \u2014 the children, the\n> families. And they understood that in order to try to attempt to do that,\n> they are going to have to rely on this AI machine called Lavender with very\n> minimal human supervision. I mean, one source said that he felt he was\n> acting as a rubber stamp on the machine\u2019s decisions.\n\n> Now, what Lavender does is it scans information on probably 90% of the\n> population of Gaza. So we\u2019re talking about, you know, more than a million\n> people. And it gives each individual a rating between one to 100, a rating\n> that is an expression of the likelihood that the machine thinks, based on a\n> list of small features \u2014 and we can get to that later \u2014 that that individual\n> is a member of the Hamas or Islamic Jihad military wings. Sources told me\n> that the military knew, because they checked \u2014 they took a random sampling\n> and checked one by one \u2014 the military knew that approximately 10% of the\n> people that the machine was marking to be killed were not Hamas militants.\n> They were not \u2014 some of them had a loose connection to Hamas. Others had\n> completely no connection to Hamas. I mean, one source said how the machine\n> would bring people who had the exact same name and nickname as a Hamas\n> operative, or people who had similar communication profiles. Like, these\n> could be civil defense workers, police officers in Gaza. And they\n> implemented, again, minimal supervision on the machine. One source said that\n> he spent 20 seconds per target before authorizing the bombing of the alleged\n> low-ranking Hamas militant \u2014 often it also could have been a civilian \u2014\n> killing those people inside their houses.\n\n> And I think this, the reliance on artificial intelligence here to mark those\n> targets, and basically the deadly way in which the officers spoke about how\n> they were using the machine, could very well be part of the reason why in\n> the first, you know, six weeks after October 7th, like one of the main\n> characteristics of the policies that were in place were entire Palestinian\n> families being wiped out inside their houses. I mean, if you look at U.N.\n> statistics, more than 50% of the casualties, more than 6,000 people at that\n> time, came from a smaller group of families. It\u2019s an expression of, you\n> know, the family unit being destroyed. And I think that machine and the way\n> it was used led to that.\n\n> AMY GOODMAN: You talk about the choosing of targets, and you talk about the\n> so-called high-value targets, Hamas commanders, and then the lower-level\n> fighters. And as you said, many of them, in the end, it wasn\u2019t either. But\n> explain the buildings that were targeted and the bombs that were used to\n> target them.\n\n> YUVAL ABRAHAM: Yeah, yeah. It\u2019s a good question. So, what sources told me is\n> that during those first weeks after October, for the low-ranking militants\n> in Hamas, many of whom were marked by Lavender, so we can say \u201calleged\n> militants\u201d that were marked by the machine, they had a predetermined, what\n> they call, \u201ccollateral damage degree.\u201d And this means that the military\u2019s\n> international law departments told these intelligence officers that for each\n> low-ranking target that Lavender marks, when bombing that target, they are\n> allowed to kill \u2014 one source said the number was up to 20 civilians, again,\n> for any Hamas operative, regardless of rank, regardless of importance,\n> regardless of age. One source said that there were also minors being marked\n> \u2014 not many of them, but he said that was a possibility, that there was no\n> age limit. Another source said that the limit was up to 15 civilians for the\n> low-ranking militants. The sources said that for senior commanders of Hamas\n> \u2014 so it could be, you know, commanders of brigades or divisions or\n> battalions \u2014 the numbers were, for the first time in the IDF\u2019s history, in\n> the triple digits, according to sources.\n\n> So, for example, Ayman Nofal, who was the Hamas commander of the Central\n> Brigade, a source that took part in the strike against that person said that\n> the military authorized to kill alongside that person 300 Palestinian\n> civilians. And we\u2019ve spoken at +972 and Local Call with Palestinians who\n> were witnesses of that strike, and they speak about, you know, four quite\n> large residential buildings being bombed on that day, you know, entire\n> apartments filled with families being bombed and killed. And that source\n> told me that this is not, you know, some mistake, like the amount of\n> civilians, of this 300 civilians, it was known beforehand to the Israeli\n> military. And sources described that to me, and they said that \u2014 I mean, one\n> source said that during those weeks at the beginning, effectively, the\n> principle of proportionality, as they call it under international law,\n> quote, \u201cdid not exist.\u201d\n\n> AMY GOODMAN: So, there\u2019s two programs. There\u2019s Lavender, and there\u2019s Where\u2019s\n> Daddy? How did they even know where these men were, innocent or not?\n\n> YUVAL ABRAHAM: Yeah, so, the way the system was designed is, there is this\n> concept, in general, in systems of mass surveillance called linking. When\n> you want to automate these systems, you want to be able to very quickly \u2014\n> you know, you get, for example, an ID of a person, and you want to have a\n> computer be very quickly able to link that ID to other stuff. And what\n> sources told me is that since everybody in Gaza has a home, has a house \u2014 or\n> at least that was the case in the past \u2014 the system was designed to be able\n> to automatically link between individuals and houses. And in the majority of\n> cases, these households that are linked to the individuals that Lavender is\n> marking as low-ranking militants are not places where there is active\n> military action taking place, according to sources. Yet the way the system\n> was designed, and programs like Where\u2019s Daddy?, which were designed to\n> search for these low-ranking militants when they enter houses \u2014\n> specifically, it sends an alert to the intelligence officers when these AI-\n> marked suspects enter their houses. The system was designed in a way that\n> allowed the Israeli military to carry out massive strikes against\n> Palestinians, sometimes militants, sometimes alleged militants, who we don\u2019t\n> know, when they were in these spaces in these houses.\n\n> And the sources said \u2014 you know, CNN reported in December that 45% of the\n> munitions, according to U.S. intelligence assessments, that Israel dropped\n> on Gaza were unguided, so-called dumb bombs, that have, you know, a larger\n> damage to civilians. They destroy the entire structure. And sources said\n> that for these low-ranking operatives in Hamas, they were only using the\n> dumb munitions, meaning they were collapsing the houses on everybody inside.\n> And when you ask intelligence officers why, one explanation they give is\n> that these people were, quote, \u201cunimportant.\u201d They were not important\n> enough, from a military perspective, that the Israeli army would, one source\n> said, waste expensive munitions, meaning more guided floor bombs that could\n> have maybe taken just a particular floor in the building.\n\n> And to me, that was very striking, because, you know, you\u2019re dropping a bomb\n> on a house and killing entire families, yet the target that you are aiming\n> to assassinate by doing so is not considered important enough to, quote,\n> \u201cwaste\u201d an expensive bomb on. And I think it\u2019s a very rare reflection of\n> sort of the way \u2014 you know, the way the Israeli military measures the value\n> of Palestinian lives in relation to expected military gain, which is the\n> principle of proportionality. And I think one thing that was very, very\n> clear from all the sources that I spoke with is that, you know, this was \u2014\n> they said it was psychologically shocking even for them, you know, like it\n> was \u2014 yeah.\n\n> So, that\u2019s the combination between Lavender and Where\u2019s Daddy? The Lavender\n> lists are fed into Where\u2019s Daddy? And these systems track the suspects and\n> wait for the moments that they enter houses, usually family houses or\n> households where no military action takes place, according to several\n> sources who did this, who spoke to me about this. And these houses are\n> bombed using unguided missiles. This was a main characteristic of the\n> Israeli policy in Gaza, at least for the first weeks.\n\n> AMY GOODMAN: You write that they said they didn\u2019t have as many smart bombs.\n> They were more expensive, so they didn\u2019t want to waste them, so they used\n> the dumb bombs \u2014\n\n> YUVAL ABRAHAM: Yeah.\n\n> AMY GOODMAN: \u2014 which kill so many more.\n\n> YUVAL ABRAHAM: Yeah, exactly. Exactly, that\u2019s what they said. But then I\n> say, if the person, you know, is not important enough for you to waste\n> ammunition on, but you\u2019re willing to kill 15 civilians, a family?\n\n> AMY GOODMAN: Yuval Abraham, I wanted to read from the Israeli military\n> statement, the IDF statement, in response to your report.\n\n> YUVAL ABRAHAM: Please.\n\n> AMY GOODMAN: They say, quote, \u201cThe process of identifying military targets\n> in the IDF consists of various types of tools and methods, including\n> information management tools, which are used in order to help the\n> intelligence analysts to gather and optimally analyze the intelligence,\n> obtained from a variety of sources. Contrary to claims, the IDF did not use\n> an artificial intelligence system that identifies terrorist operatives or\n> tries to predict whether a person is a terrorist. Information systems are\n> merely tools for analysts in the target identification process.\u201d Again,\n> that\u2019s the IDF response, Yuval Abraham, to your report. Your response?\n\n> YUVAL ABRAHAM: I read this response to some of the sources, and they said\n> that they\u2019re lying, that it\u2019s not true. And I was surprised that they were \u2014\n> you know, usually they\u2019re not so, you know, blatant in saying something that\n> is false.\n\n> I think this can very easily be disproven, because, you know, a senior-\n> ranking Israeli military official, the head of the 8200 unit\u2019s AI center,\n> gave a public lecture in last year, in 2023, in Tel Aviv University \u2014 you\n> can google it, anybody who\u2019s listening to us \u2014 where he spoke about, quote \u2014\n> I\u2019m quoting him in that lecture \u2014 \u201can AI system that the Israeli military\n> used in 2021 to find terrorists.\u201d That\u2019s what he said. So, to have that on\n> record, to have \u2014 I have the presentation slides showing how the system is\n> rating the people \u2014 and then to get a comment from the IDF spokesperson\n> saying, \u201cWe do not have a system that uses AI to...\u201d I really don\u2019t know.\n> Like, I almost thought, \u201cDo I put this in the piece or not?\u201d Because, you\n> know, like, I know \u2014 in the end, you know, I gave them the space in the\n> piece to make those claims, like I think I tried to be as dry as possible in\n> the way that I was reporting. But, really, like, I am very, very confident\n> in those findings. They are verified from from numerous sources that I\u2019ve\n> spoken with.\n\n> And I think that people who read the full investigation, read the depth of\n> it \u2014 the commander of the 8200 unit wrote a book in 2021, titled Human-\n> Machine Teams: How Synergy Between AI and Human Beings Can Revolutionize the\n> World. And in the book, he\u2019s talking about how militaries should rely on\n> artificial intelligence to, quote, \u201csolve the problem of the human\n> bottleneck\u201d in creating new targets and in the decision-making to approve\n> new targets. And he wrote in that book, he said \u2014 and this is another quote\n> from him \u2014 he says that \u201cno matter how many intelligence officers you have\n> tasked with producing targets during the war, they still will not be able to\n> produce enough targets per day.\u201d And he gives a guide in that book as to how\n> to build these AI systems. Now, I want to emphasize, you know, he writes in\n> the book very, very clearly that these systems are not supposed to replace\n> human judgment. He calls it, you know, a mutual learning between humans and\n> artificial intelligence. And he says \u2014 and the IDF still maintains this \u2014\n> they say it is intelligence officers who look at the results and make a\n> decision.\n\n> From what I heard from numerous sources, after October 7th, that stopped\n> being the cases, at least in some parts of the IDF, where, again, Amy, as I\n> said before, sources were told that if they check that the target is a man,\n> they can accept Lavender\u2019s recommendations without thoroughly looking at\n> them, without checking why the machine made the decision that it made.\n\n> And I think, you know, when speaking with sources, like, just to describe \u2014\n> like, many of these sources, you know, they were drafted to the military\n> after October 7th. Many of them were shocked by atrocities that happened on\n> October 7th, their families, their friends. Some of them did not think they\n> would be drafted to the military again. They said, \u201cOK, we have to go now.\u201d\n> There was this sense that \u2014 and gradually, when they realized what they were\n> being asked to do, the things that they are involved in, not \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t\n> say that all six are like this, but at least some of them felt, again,\n> shocked by committing atrocities and by being involved in things and killing\n> families, and they felt it\u2019s unjustifiable. And they felt a responsibility,\n> I think. And I felt this also in the previous piece that I wrote, \u201c'A mass\n> assassination factory,'\u201d which spoke about another AI machine called The\n> Gospel. They felt a need to share this information with the world, out of a\n> sense that people are not getting it. You know, they\u2019re hearing the military\n> spokesperson and all of these narratives that we\u2019ve been hearing for the\n> past six months, and they do not reflect the reality on the ground.\n\n> And I really believe, I really believe \u2014 you know, there\u2019s a looming attack\n> now on Rafah \u2014 these systems could be used there again to kill Palestinians\n> in massive numbers, these attacks, and, you know, it\u2019s placing the Israeli\n> hostages in danger who are still unjustifiably held in Gaza and need to be\n> released. There needs to be a ceasefire. It cannot go on. And I hope that\n> this investigation, that exposes things so clearly, will help more people\n> all around the world call for a ceasefire, call to release the hostages and\n> end the occupation and move towards a political solution there. For me,\n> there is no \u2014 there is no other way forward.\n\n> AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to ask if U.S. military, if U.S. technology is playing\n> a role in Israeli AI, artificial intelligence.\n\n> YUVAL ABRAHAM: So, I don\u2019t know. And there is some information that I cannot\n> fully share, like, at this moment. I\u2019m investigating, like, you know, who is\n> involved in developing these systems.\n\n> What I can tell you is, you know, based on previous experience of the 2014\n> war and the 2021 war, when the wars end, these systems are then sold to\n> militaries all over the world. And I think, regardless of, you know, the\n> horrific results and consequences of these systems in Gaza, alongside that,\n> I really think there is a danger to humanity. Like, this AI-based warfare\n> allows people to escape accountability. It allows to generate targets,\n> really, on a massive \u2014 you know, thousands, 37,000 people marked for\n> potential assassination. And it allows to do that and maintain a sort of\n> aesthetic of international law, because you have a machine that makes you a\n> target file with, you know, commander or, like, target, collateral damage,\n> but it loses all meaning.\n\n> I mean, take the principle of distinction under international law. When you\n> design a system that marks 37,000 people, and you check, and you know that\n> 10% of them are actually not militants \u2014 right? \u2014 they\u2019re loosely related to\n> Hamas or they\u2019re not related at all \u2014 and you still authorize to use that\n> system without any meaningful supervision for weeks, I mean, isn\u2019t that a\n> breach of that principle? When you authorize to kill, you know, up to 15 or\n> up to 20 civilians for targets that you consider, from a military point of\n> view, not especially important, isn\u2019t that a clear breach of the principle\n> of proportionality? You know, and I don\u2019t know, like, I think international\n> law really is in a crisis right now. And I think these AI-based systems are\n> making that crisis even worse. They are draining all of these terms from\n> meaning.\n\n> AMY GOODMAN: Let me play for you a clip of National Security Council\n> spokesperson John Kirby being questioned on Tuesday about Israel\u2019s killing\n> of seven aid workers in three cars from Chef Andr\u00e9s\u2019s World Central Kitchen.\n> This is Kirby.\n>\n\n>> NIALL STANAGE: Is firing a missile at people delivering food and killing\nthem not a violation of international humanitarian law?\n\n>\n\n>> JOHN KIRBY: Well, the Israelis have already admitted that this was a\nmistake that they made. They\u2019re doing an investigation. They\u2019ll get to the\nbottom of this. Let\u2019s not get ahead of that. ... The State Department has a\nprocess in place. And to date, as you and I are speaking, they have not found\nany incidents where the Israelis have violated international humanitarian law.\n\n> AMY GOODMAN: So, that\u2019s the U.S. top spokesperson, John Kirby, saying Israel\n> has never broken international law so far since October 7th. And again, this\n> is in response to a question about the killing of the seven aid workers, one\n> Palestinian and six international aid workers. Can you talk about your\n> response to this attack, three different missiles hitting all three cars,\n> and then what Kirby said?\n\n> YUVAL ABRAHAM: Yeah. Wow! It\u2019s quite shocking, in my mind, I mean, what he\n> said, you know, based on the evidence that exists. The first thought that\n> popped up to my mind when he was talking about, you know, Israel is\n> investigating it, since I know the statistics \u2014 so, if you take the 2014\n> bombing and war in Gaza, so, you know, 512 Palestinian children were killed.\n> Israel said that it will investigate. There were like hundreds of claims for\n> war crimes. Like, only one file the Israeli military actually prosecuted a\n> soldier about, and it was about looting of like 1,000 shekels. Everything\n> was closed. This happens, you know, 2018, 2019. Two hundred thirty\n> Palestinians are shot dead at the border. Again, tens of \u2014 one file\n> prosecuted. Like, to claim that because Israel is having an investigation,\n> it somehow means that they are getting to the bottom of this and changing\n> something, it\u2019s just mocking our intelligence, I think.\n\n> The second thing that I would say is that it\u2019s true that the state of Israel\n> has apologized for it. But if you actually look at the track record of\n> people being killed around aid trucks, this has happened over and over again\n> for Palestinians. I mean, in the beginning of March, 112 Palestinians were\n> killed around the flour aid truck. The Guardian reported at the time that 14\n> such cases happened, like in February and January. So it\u2019s clear to me that\n> the Israeli military is apologizing not because of the crime, but because of\n> the identity of the people who were killed in the crime. And I think that\u2019s\n> really hypocrisy.\n\n> And to answer the question about my findings, I mean, I don\u2019t know if\n> artificial intelligence was involved in that strike. I don\u2019t want to say\n> something that I\u2019m not, you know, 100% sure of. But what I have learned from\n> Israeli intelligence officers makes me not be surprised that this strike\n> took place, because the firing policy is completely permissive. And we\u2019re\n> seeing it. I mean, we\u2019re seeing, you know, unarmed civilians being bombed to\n> death. We saw that video of four people walking and being bombed to death.\n> We have doctors, you know, talking about how in hospitals they\u2019re seeing\n> young children, like, with bullet holes, like The Guardian investigation who\n> spoke to nine doctors that spoke about that. So, this extreme permissiveness\n> is not surprising to me.\n\n> AMY GOODMAN: Your piece doesn\u2019t talk about drones, but, Yuval, can you talk\n> about how the AI systems interact with unmanned attack drones?\n\n> YUVAL ABRAHAM: Yeah, so, you know, I said this last time, Amy. Like, I can\u2019t\n> speak about everything, also because we are sort of \u2014 always have to think\n> of the military censor in Israel. As Israeli journalists, we\u2019re very much,\n> you know, binded by that.\n\n> But the systems interact. And, you know, if somebody is marked to be killed\n> by Lavender, then that person could be killed by a warplane, they could be\n> killed by a drone, and they could be killed by a tank that\u2019s on the ground.\n> Like, there is like a sort of policy of sharing intelligence between\n> different \u2014 yeah, different units and different weapon operators.\n\n> Like, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if \u2014 because Israel said, you know, there was\n> a target, like somebody that we suspected. Of course, the aid workers and \u2014\n> like, they completely rejected that. But, like, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if\n> the flagging, you know, that the Israeli system received was somehow related\n> to a faulty automated mechanism that is, you know, mass surveilling the area\n> and picked up on something and had, you know, not the highest precision\n> rate. Again, from what I\u2019m hearing from sources, this is the atmosphere.\n> This is the case.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Investigative reporter Yuval Abraham on his latest piece for +972\nMagazine and Local Call headlined \u201c'Lavender': The AI machine directing\nIsrael\u2019s bombing spree in Gaza.\u201d He\u2019s speaking to us from Jerusalem.\n\nWhen we come back, I ask Yuval about a film he co-directed, which won the\nprize for best documentary at the Berlinale, the Berlin film festival in\nGermany. In his acceptance speech, Yuval said Israel was guilty of apartheid.\nHe\u2019ll talk about what happened next.
