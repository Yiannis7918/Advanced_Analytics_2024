It is a program\nof the IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization (ISTO), a global,\nnot-for-profit corporation that provides its member organizations with legal\nand financial infrastructure and administrative support for standards\ndevelopment and market adoption of emerging technologies.\n\nIn addition to other headsets on the market, such as Meta\u2019s Oculus Quest 3,\nthe US $3,499 Vision Pro could invigorate the market, members of the AR\nAlliance say.\n\n\u201cUnlike many other devices, Vision Pro goes beyond gaming and entertainment,\u201d\nsays Bharath Rajagopalan, the alliance\u2019s chair. \u201cUsers can engage in\nproductivity activities such as checking email and reading documents. Even\nthough the headset isn\u2019t technically pure AR, it is a way of letting people\nsimultaneously see the real world and the digital world and interact with\ncontent in an intuitive and compelling way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe launch of the Vision Pro could be a watershed moment for the AR\nindustry,\u201d adds Rajagopalan, who is director of strategic marketing for\nSTMicroelectronics, a global semiconductor company. STM is one of the\nalliance\u2019s founding members.\n\n\u201cWhen a technology leader like Apple comes into this domain in such a big way,\nit helps to validate the category,\u201d Rajagopalan says. \u201cTo advance AR, we need\nto enable everyday use of the technology for the average user, not just the\ntechies of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo advance AR, we need to enable everyday use of the technology for the\naverage user, not just the techies of the world.\u201d\n\nAfter trying out the Vision Pro, Rajagopalan says he believes the headset,\nwhich integrates an array of technologies, is the kind of device that is\nneeded to bring together companies in the hardware ecosystem to advance AR\ntechnology.\n\n\u201cApple is unique in the sense that it develops, or facilitates the development\nof, the many critical technologies and components for such a device,\u201d he says.\nBut companies that don\u2019t or can\u2019t take that approach \u201cwill have to pick and\nchoose different classes of technologies and components to integrate into\ntheir products. To facilitate faster time to market, enable interoperability,\nensure a robust supply chain, and drive for lower costs, having standards and\nprotocols will be a key element.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where the AR Alliance comes in.\n\n## Leveraging existing technical standards\n\nThe alliance grew out of the LaSAR Alliance, a collaboration of companies that\nworked to advance laser-scanning technology for use as displays on AR\nwearables such as smart glasses. The organization decided to expand the scope\nand rebrand the alliance last year after fulfilling its mission of\nestablishing laser scanning as a core AR display technology.\n\nWhile the alliance was reorganizing, Apple unveiled the Vision Pro. Several\nLaSAR Alliance members said the timing was right to advance AR beyond display\ntechnologies\u2014which led to the AR Alliance. Corning, Dispelix, Essilor\nLuxottica, Microoled, and OptoFidelity are some of the other member\norganizations and founding members, in addition to STM.\n\n\u201cWe decided to take what we did for laser-scanning technology and think about\nhow we could address the overall needs of the AR marketplace,\u201d Rajagopalan\nsays. \u201cWe asked ourselves what were the things that were really going to help\nthis industry and the market advance. Just like for other industries, the way\nto do it is to have standards and protocols and an ecosystem that companies\ncan coalesce around.\n\n\u201cA benefit of the alliance being part of IEEE-ISTO is that it can leverage\nIEEE\u2019s work on existing AR, VR, and mixed-reality standards.\u201d\n\n## Tackling image quality, connectivity, and certification\n\nThe first step the alliance took was to meet with companies building AR\nhardware and software to find out their needs and to solicit ideas.\n\nThe businesses \u201casked for a neutral environment that allows companies to come\ntogether\u2014not competitively but cooperatively,\u201d Rajagopalan says. Their other\nrequests were to work together on addressing key challenges such as improving\nimage quality, tackling connectivity challenges, and developing technical\nstandards necessary for product certifications.\n\nWith more headsets expected to come on the market, Rajagopalan says, the\nalliance wants to ensure there are uniform ways to measure their image\nquality. Currently none exist for AR devices, so the alliance\u2019s image quality\nmethods, metrics, and metrology working group is researching and developing\napproaches and techniques.\n\nAnother group is working to establish connectivity protocols for smart\nglasses, so-called light AR. Such glasses let users access digital content\nsuch as maps, calendars, and other apps that deliver relevant information, and\nthey can display instructions while the user interacts with the physical\nworld.\n\nA compelling user experience requires smooth, reliable wireless connectivity.\nWorking with existing standards but adapting them for the needs of smart\nglasses is the approach the alliance is taking, such as by adapting latency\nand bandwidth specifications, Rajagopalan says.\n\nAnother group of the AR Alliance is assisting the Underwriters Laboratory\nTechnical Committee 8400 with establishing standards for testing and\ncertifying augmented, virtual, and mixed-reality products. UL is in the\nprocess of defining standards and certification requirements.\n\nUL wanted a single voice for the industry, Rajagopalan says, and it didn\u2019t\nwant one that might be biased in favor of one company.\n\n\u201cThe reason for forming this alliance is so that we can be that voice of the\nindustry,\u201d he says. \u201cOur tagline is Building AR Together. That\u2019s the whole\npoint.\u201d\n\nTo participate in the alliance, you can apply here.\n\nThis article has been updated from an earlier version.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * Stay Current on How VR and AR Could Impact Your Industry \u203a\n  * Augmented-Reality Platform Lets Consumers Customize Products \u203a\n  * Tiny Lasers Could Finally Bring Us Really Smart AR Glasses \u203a\n\napple vision proaugmented realityconsumer electronicsieee products and\nservicesstandardstype:ti\n\nKathy Pretz\n\nKathy Pretz is editor in chief for The Institute, which covers all aspects of\nIEEE, its members, and the technology they're involved in.
