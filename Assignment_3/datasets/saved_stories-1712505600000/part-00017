Exposure\ntherapy, where people are gradually exposed to what they\u2019re afraid of in a\ncontrolled way, is the best treatment we have, teaching the brain that the\nfeared thing is no longer a threat. This therapy doesn\u2019t just reduce fear of\nthe specific thing it\u2019s aimed at but can also lessen fear of other, similar\nthings. For example, treating a fear of spiders might also reduce a fear of\ncockroaches.\n\nIris Kodzaga and colleagues looked into whether this effect can apply to\ncompletely different fears, like treating a fear of spiders to help with a\nfear of heights, to understand how broad and effective this therapy can be.\nThis research was published in Translational Psychiatry.\n\nA telephone screening process identified individuals between 18\u201340 years old\nwho reported fears of spiders and heights, excluding those with acute\npsychological conditions or ongoing treatments. This process narrowed down the\nparticipant pool to a final sample of 50, divided into exposure and control\ngroups.\n\nMaterials used in the study included a non-venomous house spider and a\n72-meter church tower for the fear-inducing stimuli, alongside various\ndiagnostic and assessment tools such as the Mini-DIPS, Beck\u2019s Depression\nInventory-II, and the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire. Behavioral Approach Tests\n(BATs) assessed fear and avoidance behaviors towards spiders and heights.\n\nThe study started with the initial screening and recruitment, followed by a\npre-assessment phase where participants completed diagnostic interviews and\nquestionnaires, and underwent BATs for spiders and heights to establish\nbaseline fear levels. The exposure group then received therapy based on \u00d6st\u2019s\nprotocol, involving 14 steps of increasing proximity to the spider, monitored\nby the Subjective Unit of Distress Scale.\n\nA post-assessment for this group involved repeating the BATs and\nquestionnaires to gauge changes in fear and avoidance behaviors. The control\ngroup underwent a similar process but without the exposure therapy, to assess\nthe impact of time and task repetition alone.\n\nExposure therapy significantly reduced fear and avoidance behaviors in\nindividuals with a fear of spiders, with improvements observed in both\nsubjective fear levels and behavioral scores during spider BATs. These effects\nwere not only confined to the treated spider fear but also generalized to an\nuntreated fear of heights.\n\nBoth the exposure and control groups exhibited increased approach behavior\ntowards heights, but the exposure group showed a more substantial reduction in\nfear, as evidenced by decreased subjective fear ratings and Acrophobia\nQuestionnaire scores. This indicates that exposure therapy not only directly\naddresses specific fears but also has a broader impact on reducing related,\nuntreated fears, showcasing its effectiveness in tackling fear generalization.\n\nFuture studies ought to replicate these findings across various anxiety\ndisorders and include long-term follow-ups to assess the durability of these\ngeneralization effects.\n\nThe paper, \u201cGeneralization of beneficial exposure effects to untreated stimuli\nfrom another fear category\u201d, was authored by Iris Kodzaga, Ekrem Dere, and\nArmin Zlomuzica.\n\nTweetSendScanShareSendPin1ShareShareShare\n\n### RELATED\n\nAnxiety\n\n### New neuroscience research links social anxiety disorder to altered brain\nthickness in several regions\n\nApril 2, 2024\n\nNeuroimaging research has found individuals with social anxiety disorder have\nincreased cortical thickness in specific brain regions, indicating altered\nbrain structures linked to attention and socio-emotional processing, compared\nto healthy individuals.\n\nRead more\n\nAnxiety\n\n### How can I stop overthinking everything?
