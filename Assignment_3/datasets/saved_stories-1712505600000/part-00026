Read all about it in our End\nof Life Announcement\n\n# End of Life Announcement\n\nWritten by ElephantSQL blog team 2024-02-26\n\nImportant announcement: ElephantSQL will discontinue its services. The product\nwill reach its End of Life on January 27, 2025.\n\nAre you a customer? Learn more about practical information, important dates,\nmigration options and contact information to our support at End of Life -\nCustomer Information\n\n## Epilog\n\nBack in 2013 we launched ElephantSQL as one of the first services out there to\noffer hosted PostgreSQL. Since then we\u2019ve assisted many customers building all\nkinds of applications on the platform.\n\nIn the spirit of keeping our company agile, we\u2019ve made the strategic decision\nto focus on something else: the AMQP protocol via CloudAMQP. We're noticing\nsignificant growth and interest in both RabbitMQ and LavinMQ (our high\nperformance AMQP broker), where we continue as market leaders. As such, we\nplan to invest more in these areas with the full attention from the company.\n\nWe want to express our gratitude to our customers and partners who have been\nwith us throughout this time. Though this chapter may be ending, our\ncommitment to supporting you remains. We're here to help you until you\ncontinue your PostgreSQL journey elsewhere.\n\n## Service Shutdown Schedule\n\nExisting customers will have complete access to the service until its\ndiscontinuation on January 27, 2025. After May 1, 2024, we will cease to\naccept new users. Comprehensive information regarding our shutdown process is\navailable under End of Life - Customer Information\n\n## Customer Information and Action Plan\n\nOur top priority is ensuring a smooth transition for our current customers.\nFor this reason, we have compiled all necessary information, including contact\nand support details as well as migration options here.\n\nEnd of Life - Customer Information\n\n## The next chapter for our team\n\nAs we navigate through this transition, our team is not saying goodbye but\nrather stepping into a new chapter. The expertise, dedication, and passion\nthat powered ElephantSQL are now joining forces with our colleagues at\nCloudAMQP and LavinMQ. This strategic shift allows us to focus our collective\nefforts on advancing our service offerings in Message Queuing and Message\nStreaming solutions.\n\nFor more details on our journey ahead and what this means for our team and\nservices, we invite you to read our announcement: Next Chapter for 84codes\n\n#### Menu\n\n  * Home\n  * Pricing\n  * Documentation\n  * Support\n  * Blog\n\n#### Resources\n\n  * Changelog\n  * Legal and Policies\n  * Security and Compliance\n  * Status\n\nElephantSQL\n\nContact Support\n\nOpen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2011-2024 ElephantSQL.
