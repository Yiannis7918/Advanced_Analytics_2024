A former Geek\nSquad agent tells the outlet that they received an email on Tuesday about a\nwork from home event the following day regarding a \u201ccompany change.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur leadership gave individual calls stating we were being let go for the\nsimple fact that the company couldn\u2019t afford to pay us, more or less. It was\nextremely short notice and devastating,\u201d an ex-Geek Squad worker told 404\nMedia.\n\nOver at r/GeekSquad, recently laid-off Geek Squad agents have posted photos of\ntheir badges in solidarity and referred to themselves as belonging to a Geek\nSquad \u201csleeper cell\u201d, writing that they\u2019re \u201cgoing sleeper\u201d along with their\nlocation and badge number.\n\nThe Verge has reached out to the company for more details about the layoffs\nand will update if we hear back.\n\n### Related\n\n  * Best Buy will no longer carry physical movies in 2024, and I am no longer whole\n\nDuring the company\u2019s last earnings call in February, Best Buy\u2019s CEO Corie\nBarry said to expect layoffs this year as part of a push to \u201credirect\ncorporate resources to make sure we have the necessary assets dedicated to\nareas like AI and other elements of our strategy and rightsize parts of the\nbusiness where we expect to see lower volume than we envisioned a few years\nago. whether that is the result of lower industry sales or due to decisions we\nmade like evolving our paid membership benefits.\u201d\n\nAs far as why, Barrie referenced multiple \u201cmacro factors\u201d affecting consumer\nspending on electronics, including a drop in sales following heightened demand\nduring the pandemic, and that, \u201chonestly, really, right now, there isn\u2019t any\nmassive current innovation that would spur you to go buy a new laptop.\u201d\n\nBarry called out Geek Squad repair operations specifically, saying, \u201cOur\nfiscal \u201825 initiatives are focused on driving further efficiencies across\nforward and reverse supply chain, our Geek Squad repair operations and our\ncustomer care experience. We will continue to lean heavily on analytics and\ntechnology to achieve these efficiencies. This includes leveraging AI safely\nand effectively.\u201d Another area she\u2019s looking at is health, mentioning Best Buy\nHealth as an area \u201cwhere we are leveraging our expertise and our Geek Squad\nagents to capitalize on the growing use of technology to help provide health\ncare in the home.\u201d\n\nThat \u201crightsizing\u201d also includes the physical space in stores, where she\nconfirmed Best Buy \u201cwill be removing physical media and updating our mobile\ndigital imaging, computing, tablets, and smart home departments.\u201d\n\nNumerous former and current Geek Squad employees on Reddit over the years\nnoted the high turnover rate associated with the job due to its relatively low\npay and slim prospects of promotion. Based on 231 salaries, Glassdoor\nestimated a pay range of $16-$21 per hour for a Geek Squad agent. This\nestimate appears to be accurate based on the listed open roles on Best Buy\u2019s\nwebsite. For example, there\u2019s currently an active listing for a \u201cGeek Squad\nCity Supervisor\u201d in Brooks, Kentucky, with an hourly pay range of $20-$30 per\nhour. An opening for an entry-level Geek Squad agent at a store in Encinitas,\nCalifornia, has an hourly pay range of $15-$19 per hour.\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## Apple opens the App Store to retro game emulators\n\n  2. ## The PlayStation Vita still rules\n\n  3. ## iPhone emulators are allowed now so here are some great iOS controllers\n\n  4. ## Best Buy Geek Squad employees report mass layoffs\n\n  5. ## OpenAI transcribed over a million hours of YouTube videos to train GPT-4\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from this stream The tech industry\u2019s layoffs and hiring freezes: all\nof the news\n\n  * ### Amazon lays off hundreds in the AWS physical store technology team.\n\nApr 3, 2024, 4:53 PM UTC\n\n  * ### EA is the latest gaming company to lay off workers.\n\nFeb 28, 2024, 9:50 PM UTC\n\n  * ### \u201cWhy are we expected to do the coding Olympics for every company that wants to interview you?\u201d\n\nFeb 23, 2024, 6:40 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Mozilla is laying off around 60 workers and scaling back its Mastodon instance.\n\nFeb 13, 2024, 10:35 PM UTC\n\nSee all 201 stories\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
