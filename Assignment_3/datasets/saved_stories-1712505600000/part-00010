It\ntalks about how I prefer issues to PRs, how I work in batches, and how I'm\ntrigger-happy with bans. It's all about setting expectations.\n\nIt got some unexpected attention, so I'm sharing it with my Maintainer\nDispatches subscribers. Feedback welcome! (As a reminder, if you're only here\nfor the cryptography topics, there's a one-click Unsubscribe link at the\nbottom of the email that lets you choose which issues to receive.)\n\n## Filippo's open source maintenance policy\n\nThis policy explains how I work on my open source projects, what you should\nexpect from me as a maintainer, and how to contribute.\n\nYou can always find the latest version of this document at\nfilippo.io/maintenance.\n\n### I work in cycles\n\nI work on a number of codebases, and the way to apportion attention that works\nbest with my brain is to batch up work, focus on a project for one to four\nweeks, and then move to a different project. This reduces context switching\noverhead and gives me time to consider overall trends.\n\nThis means there might be extended periods during which I am not actively\nworking on a specific project. This does NOT mean the project is unmaintained:\nI still read every issue filed, and would react promptly to urgent issues,\nsuch as security reports or any breakage that makes a project not work anymore\nfor its current users.\n\nIf a project is unmaintained, it will be either archived or moved to\nFiloSottile/mostly-harmless.\n\n### Projects have a precise scope\n\nMost of my projects are meant to be simple solutions to a specific problem,\nand I generally try to resist scope creep.\n\nI understand that might make them not a good fit for you, and that\u2019s ok. Feel\nfree to open a discussion or a feature request, but please understand if we\nconclude that the issue is out of scope. Forks are welcome!\n\nThis is critical both to keep the UX simple, and to keep the maintenance\nburden manageable.\n\n### Well researched issues are gold\n\nThe most useful contributions are detailed issue reports. The more you can\ntell us about environment and expectations the better. I truly appreciate when\nusers investigate further, or do the work of checking how other\nimplementations behave, or what the relevant specifications say.\n\nEven if you can\u2019t do the extra work, feel free to open an issue. I don\u2019t\nresent any issue, they\u2019re all gifts (but as gifts they don\u2019t entitle you to a\nresponse).\n\n### Experience reports are gems\n\nEven if something might look like it\u2019s working as intended, or if you\u2019re\nencountering a non-technical issue, I invite you to file an experience report.\n\nIt can be as simple as \u201cthis error was confusing, even if I figured it out\u201d or\nas high-level as \u201cgetting started was a mess, here are all the things I tried\u201d\nor as specific as \u201cwhen I try to use this for this workflow it\u2019s very clunky\u201d.\n\nFocus on your experience, not on the solution. Oftentimes the solution will\nneed to take into account the needs of other stakeholders, or solve multiple\nissues at once, but having a clear idea of a problem is the first step.\n\nMaybe we will conclude there\u2019s nothing we can do within the project\u2019s scope\n(see above), but every experience report informs how I think about the\nproject.\n\nIf you want to contribute but don\u2019t know where to start, try to use the\nproject from scratch keeping a friction log of all the things that you found\nconfusing or difficult or unclear, and then share that.\n\n### PRs might get reimplemented\n\nUnlike some projects, I do not prefer PRs to issues, for a number of reasons.\n\n  * Working in batches (see above) means you might have to wait a while before I review a PR, and you might have moved on to other work by then.\n  * I don\u2019t have the bandwidth for long review cycles, but I am also very particular about the code I accept into a project, since it will be on me to maintain it.\n  * Cryptography and security projects require an unusually high degree of code review.\n  * Contributors naturally focus on their use case and circumstances when writing patches, which might need to be adapted to serve other project users.\n  * I am generally not trying to build large contributor communities around most of my projects, as they are small scoped tools (see above).\n\nAll together, this means that detailed issues are usually more useful to me\nthan PRs, and while you\u2019re welcome to open a PR as a way to demonstrate an\nissue, you should expect it to be reimplemented rather than merged. Please\ndon\u2019t take this personally. I try to use Co-authored-by lines liberally to\nshare credit where possible.\n\nThere are some exceptions, like support for operating systems I am not\nfamiliar with, or features I am not well-equipped to implement. We can discuss\nthose cases in the issue tracker. I am also usually happy to merge\ntrivial/short changes.\n\n### Funding\n\nI\u2019m a professional Open Source maintainer. If your company might be interested\nin enabling my work, in the reciprocal value of a direct line to a maintainer,\nand in unlimited access to my expertise, reach out to discuss a retainer! \ud83d\udce8\n\nI believe the critical role of open source maintainer can develop into a real\nprofession, commanding compensation in line with that of a senior software\nengineer, charging companies that rely on open source projects and wish to get\naccess to the maintainer's unique and extensive expertise.\n\nI don't rely on crowdfunding for sustainability, so I generally don't solicit\ndonations from individuals. If you wish to express gratitude or encourage my\nwork, send me a postcard! \ud83d\udcee\n\n> Filippo Valsorda 9450 SW Gemini Dr #52960 Beaverton, Oregon 97008-7105 USA\n\n### Conduct\n\nMost of my projects don\u2019t have a formal code of conduct, but I uphold the\nvalues of the Go Community Code of Conduct and I have a zero-tolerance policy\nfor toxic behavior.\n\nComments that create an unwelcoming environment will lead to a ban. This is my\ngarden, you can go be a jerk elsewhere.\n\n### Security\n\nPlease email me privately at security@filippo.io to report a potential\nsecurity issue. If you\u2019re not sure if something is a security issue, reach\nout! You should expect a reply within a week, usually much quicker.\n\nI am happy with standard ninety days disclosure timelines, or with embargoes\nno longer than nine months. I will produce security advisories and file CVEs\nfor any issue I consider a security issue.\n\nI know projects are not entitled to free security research or coordinated\ndisclosure, and I appreciate the contribution of reporters. I do not offer bug\nbounties at this time.\n\n#### On security scanners\n\nI do not update dependencies just to silence automated reports of unrelated\nvulnerabilities that don't affect my project. (Nor do I subscribe to the\nendless dependabot churn, although my opinions about the benefits of that are\nmore nuanced.)\n\nUsing automated tools that fail to do even package-level scoping and then\npushing the churn onto every upstream project to reduce noise is\nunsustainable. My responsibility is making sure my projects are not affected\nby security vulnerabilities. The responsibility of scanning tools is making\nsure they don't disturb their users with false positives.\n\ngovulncheck is awesome and even does static analysis to filter vulnerabilities\nat the symbol level, but simple package-level filtering is something you\nshould demand of your vendors.\n\n## The picture\n\nThat's it for the policy. But if I don't include a picture I found people\ncomplain, which I love to be honest. If you got this far, you might also want\nto follow me on Bluesky (now open for registration!) at\n@filippo.abyssdomain.expert or on Mastodon at @filippo@abyssdomain.expert.\n\nOne perk of Milan (which can't compete with Rome, but still) is that when I'm\nrushing up a stairwell to catch a train, this is the stairwell.\n\nMy awesome clients\u2014Sigsum, Latacora, Interchain, Smallstep, Ava Labs,\nTeleport, and Tailscale\u2014are funding all my work for the community and through\nour retainer contracts they get face time and unlimited access to advice on Go\nand cryptography.\n\nHere are a few words from some of them!\n\nLatacora \u2014 Latacora bootstraps security practices for startups. Instead of\nwasting your time trying to hire a security person who is good at everything\nfrom Android security to AWS IAM strategies to SOC2 and apparently has the\ntime to answer all your security questionnaires plus never gets sick or takes\na day off, you hire us. We provide a crack team of professionals prepped with\nprocesses and power tools, coupling individual security capabilities with\nstrategic program management and tactical project management.\n\nTeleport \u2014 For the past five years, attacks and compromises have been shifting\nfrom traditional malware and security breaches to identifying and compromising\nvalid user accounts and credentials with social engineering, credential theft,\nor phishing. Teleport Identity Governance & Security is designed to eliminate\nweak access patterns through access monitoring, minimize attack surface with\naccess requests, and purge unused permissions via mandatory access reviews.\n\nAva Labs \u2014 We at Ava Labs, maintainer of AvalancheGo (the most widely used\nclient for interacting with the Avalanche Network), believe the sustainable\nmaintenance and development of open source cryptographic protocols is critical\nto the broad adoption of blockchain technology. We are proud to support this\nnecessary and impactful work through our ongoing sponsorship of Filippo and\nhis team.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
