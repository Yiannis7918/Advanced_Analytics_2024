New-vehicle average transaction prices (ATP) in February 2024 declined from January and were lower year over year by 2.2%; new-vehicle ATPs are now down 5.4% from the December 2022 peak.\n  2. February electric vehicle (EV) prices were lower by nearly 13% year over year, led by strong incentive packages; volume leader Tesla posted higher prices after hitting bottom in January.\n  3. Affordability continues to fade: Nine new vehicles transacted for under $25,000 in February, down from 29 in February 2021.\n\nATLANTA, March 11, 2024 \u2013 New-vehicle transaction prices (ATP) in February\n2024 held mostly steady, according to an analysis by Kelley Blue Book, falling\nless than one-tenth of 1% from the revised January ATP. The average\ntransaction price of a new vehicle in the U.S. last month was $47,244, down\n2.2% from February 2023 and down 5.4% from the market peak in December 2022.\nStill, new-vehicle prices in the U.S. remain elevated, higher by nearly 14%\ncompared to February 2021.\n\n##### NEW-VEHICLE AVERAGE TRANSACTION PRICE\n\nWith new-vehicle inventory continuing to rise in the U.S., downward price\npressure and higher incentives appear to be key drivers of the market\u2019s\ncurrent momentum. At the start of February, new-vehicle inventory in the U.S.\nstood near 2.61 million units, a 50% increase from one year earlier. Sales\nlast month picked up from January and, with a seasonally adjusted annual rate\n(SAAR) of sales of 15.8 million, kept 2024 on track for the best new-vehicle\nsales year since 2019.\n\n\u201cWhile everyone may applaud that prices are coming down, even marginally for\nthe moment, affordability is still challenging the market,\u201d said Erin Keating,\nexecutive analyst for Cox Automotive. \u201cMost shoppers have not seen their\nincomes increase as quickly as vehicle prices, so affording a new vehicle\nremains difficult. We should also note that despite rising inventory, which is\ngood for consumers, the levels are muted, not alarming.\u201d\n\n## Higher Incentives Help Keep New-Vehicle Prices in Check\n\nNew-vehicle incentives in February averaged 5.9% of transaction price, up from\n5.7% in January and significantly higher than the average of 3.1% recorded in\nFebruary one year ago. Incentives hit bottom in the fall of 2022 \u2013 2.1% of ATP\nin September of that year \u2013 and, along with inventory, have increased steadily\nsince.\n\n##### INDUSTRY AVERAGE TRANSACTION PRICE VERSUS INDUSTRY AVERAGE INCENTIVE\nSPEND AS % OF ATP\n\nLuxury vehicle incentives continue to be more generous than non-luxury. In\nFebruary, incentives in the luxury market averaged 6.1% of ATP, down from\nJanuary but nearly twice the level seen one year ago. The luxury ATP in\nFebruary was $61,424, an increase from January. Non-luxury vehicle incentives\naveraged 5.9% in February, an increase from 5.5% in January. Non-luxury\nvehicle ATPs last month were $44,052, generally unchanged from January, when\nprices were estimated at $44,062.\n\nIncentive packages continue to be highest with Infiniti, Audi, Mini, and\nPolestar, all over 10% of average transaction price, according to Kelley Blue\nBook estimates. On the other end of the scale, Lexus, Toyota, Porsche, and\nLand Rover had some of the lowest incentives last month, all 3.0% or lower.\nIncentives at Land Rover averaged only 2.0% of ATP, according to the Kelley\nBlue Book estimates. Still, the average price paid for a new Land Rover last\nmonth was over $102,000.\n\n## Affordability Continues To Fade\n\nIn February, of the roughly 275 different models available in the U.S. market,\nonly nine had transaction prices below $25,000 and only two transacted for\nless than $20,000. The Kia Rio and Mitsubishi Mirage were the two most\naffordable vehicles in the U.S. last month, and both are being dropped from\nthe market. While vehicle price increases have slowed in the past year, the\nindustry\u2019s vehicle mix and shift toward luxury has tilted the U.S. auto market\naway from affordability. In February 2021 \u2013 three years ago \u2013 there were 29\nvehicles with transaction prices routinely below $25,000, including eight\ndifferent models transacting below $20,000.\n\n##### PRICE CHANGE PERCENTAGE BY AUTOMAKER\n\nThe market is in a new place now. Last month, the top of the market was more\ncrowded than ever: Among mainstream brands, 30 different vehicles posted\naverage transaction prices over $100,000, with the Mercedes G-Class on top\nwith an ATP of $203,154. In fact, the February Kelley Blue Book report shows\nthat significantly more vehicles in the U.S. transact at prices above $75,000\n(sales of more than 81,000) than below $25,000 (nearly 52,000). According to\nthe latest Cox Automotive/Moody Analytics Vehicle Affordability Index, new-\nvehicle affordability has improved in recent months but remains far worse\ntoday than it was in 2019. (Note: Kelley Blue Book estimates exclude exotics\nfrom brands including Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Rolls Royce.)\n\n## Tesla Prices Rise, But EV Prices Continue To Decline\n\nAccording to newly revised electric vehicle (EV) transaction price data, the\naverage price paid for an electric vehicle in February was $52,314, down from\na revised $54,863 in January, according to Cox Automotive and Kelley Blue Book\nestimates. EV transaction prices in February were lower year over year by\n12.8%, an accelerating decline compared to January when prices were lower year\nover year by 11.6%.\n\n\u201cOur research continues to show that price remains a significant barrier for\nconsumer adoption,\u201d said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of Industry\nInsights at Cox Automotive. \u201cWhile the higher inventory levels and increased\ncompetition continue to drive down the price premium of EVs, it\u2019s important to\nacknowledge that EVs remain priced above mainstream non-luxury vehicles by\nnearly 19%.\u201d\n\nThe market\u2019s general EV price decline has been led in part by the two most\npopular EVs in the U.S. \u2013 the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y. Transaction prices\nfor the Model Y last month, estimated at $49,363, were the lowest on record\nand were lower versus February 2023 by 16.2%. Model 3 transaction prices last\nmonth, at $43,614, were lower year over year by 12% and near the lowest level\non record. High incentives and discounts on most models also continue to play\na major role in lower EV prices.\n\nDownload the data tables\n\n### Sign up here to receive bi-weekly updates on news and trends dominating\nthe automotive industry.\n\n* ## @CoxAutomotive\n\nTweets by @CoxAutomotive\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\n##### Tags\n\nATP, average transaction price, new-vehicle prices\n\n## Related Content\n\n6 min read\n\nData Point Wholesale Used-Vehicle Prices Declined in March Wholesale used-\nvehicle prices (on a mix, mileage, and seasonally adjusted basis) were down in\nMarch compared to February...
