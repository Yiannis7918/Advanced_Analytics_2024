AI Powered to be You. Just You.\n\nNUCA is a speculative design and art project by Mathias Vef and Benedikt Gro\u00df.\nThe project aims to provoke and question the current trajectory of generative\nAI in reproducing body images.\n\nNUCA is an AI-powered camera that redefines image creation. NUCA captures\nindividuals in their purest form \u2013 no clothing, literally stripped down to\ntheir authentic selves in their natural state.\n\nNUCA explainer and project summary video.\n\nNUCA startup video: NUCA framed as a speculative consumer product in the\nmanner of a typical tech startup pitch video, trying with a private beta\ncampaign to find its users.\n\nDemo video showing the functional prototype of the NUCA cam.\n\nA camera that renders people completely naked? Ever fantasized about\nSuperman\u2019s X-Ray Vision? NUCA brings that childhood dream (of many boys) to\nlife, challenging our perceptions of privacy and exposure. The project wants\nto explore what that \u201cdream\u201d coming true could mean and explore this new\nscenario together with you. Unlike other deepfakes, the NUCA device ties\ncreator and subject physically together, and shows the result immediately. It\nso takes away the anonymity that is inherent to internet deepfakes and\ncontrasts playfulness with this nightmarish trend. To make this speculative\n(though very plausible) scenario tangible, NUCA is framed in the manner of a\ntypical tech startup, trying with a private beta campaign to find its users.\n\nNUCA is a speculative consumer product and not meant to be used uncontrolled\nin \u201cthe wild\u201d. The generated images are not used in any way, except with\nexplicit consent given. To ensure the safety of minors, the project is\nexclusively for adults.\n\nNUCA has already sparked diverse reactions, ranging from fears of AI's bias\ntowards body cult and beauty mania to enthusiasm for its celebration of\nnatural human beauty and form. This project prompts a crucial discussion on\nAI's potential, emphasizing consent, algorithmic fairness, and the societal\nimpacts of AI-generated imagery. As Emanuel Maiberg and Samantha Cole put it,\nwe must confront that we are facing an \u201cexplosion of non-consensual sexual\nimagery that\u2019s seeping out of every crack of internet infrastructure [...] a\nnew type of pornography in which humans are only a memory that\u2019s copied and\nremixed to instantly generate whatever sexual image a user can describe with\nwords\u201d. [Source]\n\nThe current NUCA prototype is a 3d-printed camera (19.5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 1.5 cm, 430g).\nThe device is equipped with a 37 mm wide angle lens and an ergonomic grip. The\nviewfinder displays the input image and can be configured to show some of the\ninput parameters e.g. pose detection in real-time. By pressing the trigger,\nthe camera will create an estimated natural nude representation of the person\nbeing photographed. The inputs of the generative image process are the photo,\nthe person\u2019s pose (estimated skeleton) and the landmarks of the person\u2019s face.\nThe input photo is being analyzed by a custom classifier on 45 identifiers on\ngender, age, ethnicity, expression, hair, glasses, body shape etc. These\nratings are then being used to generate a base image by formulating a prompt\nfor a text-to-image AI (Stable Diffusion). The base image is a generic\nestimation of a nude person fulfilling this prompt. In the last step the image\nis then being individualized by taking the person\u2019s face and pose into account\nin the final development of the nude portrait.\n\n## Contact\n\nContact us.
