Texans\nworked with their lawmakers, and now the state will be the first to\nsuccessfully reverse a ban on imported cars.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been following this multi-year saga, I\u2019ll bring you up to\nspeed. The Imported Vehicle Safety Compliance Act of 1988 was passed under the\nguise of protecting American consumers from potentially unsafe imported\nvehicles that weren\u2019t built to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The law\neffectively bans the importation of non-compliant vehicles until they\u2019re 25\nyears old or they have been converted to U.S. standards. Once either is met,\nthe federal government no longer cares. So, many enthusiasts wait until their\nfavorite vehicles reach that magical age. Sadly, states have been pushing\nback.\n\nThe Subaru Crosstrek Wilderness Has A Weird Skidplate\n\nIn 2021, Maine changed its laws to state that any vehicle that does not meet\nFMVSS is an off-road vehicle and therefore not legal to drive on its roads.\nThis change was made infamous when the owners of Mitsubishi Delica vans began\nreporting that the state revoked their registrations. As if a floodgate had\nopened, other states joined in, removing imported Japanese cars from their\nroads in one way or another.\n\nUpdate: To be clear, Maine was not the first state to ban Kei trucks. Many\nstates had existing bans on Kei trucks dating back a decade or longer.\nHowever, Maine was the first state to enact a practically universal imported\nvehicle ban under then-new guidance issued by a lobbying group. This triggered\nother states to follow suit, as I\u2019ll explain below.\n\nMercedes Streeter\n\nSince Maine kicked off the tidal wave, enthusiasts in Rhode Island, New York,\nPennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Texas have all reported headaches in\ngetting their vehicles titled and registered. Kei truck registration has been\na longtime battle in Texas, with Kei truck owners reporting registration\ndenials as far back as the late 2000s. However, things appeared to get better\njust for them to get worse again in 2021, the same time the aforementioned\nstates started their own bans.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## What A Headache\n\nTexas Kei Truck Advocates\n\nAs I have reported many times before, all of this traces back to the\nAssociation of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA). The AAMVA is a non-\ngovernmental non-profit lobbying organization composed of motor vehicle\nadministrators, law enforcement administrators, and executives from all 50\nstates, Canada, Mexico, the Virgin Islands, and Washington D.C. Among other\nthings, the organization seeks standardization of laws across member states\nregarding traffic safety, vehicle titling, and driver licensing. AAMVA does\nnot have legislative power but it does urge all member states to follow its\n\u201cbest practices.\u201d\n\nThe AAMVA has been studying Japanese and Chinese Kei vehicles since at least\nthe late 2000s. Back then, the AAMVA didn\u2019t really know how to handle the\nflood of cheap 25 mph speed-limited off-road utility trucks that came in from\nChina. The answer came courtesy of an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety\nopinion published in 2010. The IIHS crash-tested a Kei truck against a Ford\nRanger and concluded that low-speed vehicles and mini trucks are unsafe and\nshould be removed from the road.\n\nFrom that point forward, the AAMVA has advocated against allowing Kei trucks\nfrom being allowed on state roads. In 2021, this guidance went even further,\nessentially telling states to ban any vehicle that doesn\u2019t meet FMVSS. The\nAAMVA was serious about this, stating in its documentation that if banning a\nvehicle ran afoul state law, it urged lawmakers to change the laws until the\nban became legal.\n\nTo these states, it doesn\u2019t matter that a 25-year-old Kei truck imported from\nJapan doesn\u2019t have a speed limiter and is exempt from meeting FMVSS on the\nfederal level. The states retain the right to determine what can and cannot\ndrive on their roads. Weirdly, while the AAMVA is urging the states free will\nto ban any vehicle that doesn\u2019t meet FMVSS, states have focused primarily on\nimports from Japan, usually just in the Kei class.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAAMVAAAMVA\n\nThis has caused turmoil within enthusiast communities in the impacted states.\nIt has also caused concern in states that aren\u2019t currently banning JDM cars.\nIf Maine wants to stop people from registering Mitsubishi Delicas, nothing is\nstopping Illinois from doing the same.\n\nEnthusiasts have been fighting back, from individual DMV appeals in\nPennsylvania and Rhode Island to a lawsuit in Georgia. One Maine lawmaker even\nintroduced a bill that would have reversed the ban in that state. Sadly, that\nbill didn\u2019t get traction and died off. Some people have gotten small victories\nin their individual appeals, but until now, not a single state has reversed\nits bans. That was until Texans got involved.\n\n## Come And Take It\n\nTexas Kei Truck Advocates\n\nIn my last entry, I noted how I spoke with David from the Texas Kei Truck\nAdvocates. A lot of Kei truck advocacy groups have launched in the wake these\nbans, but the Texas Kei Truck Advocates had a different strategy than everyone\nelse.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s been happening with Kei truck owners in the state:\n\n> David and I spoke on a call where he revealed that the situation in Texas is\n> a bit weird. Some Kei truck owners haven\u2019t experienced any issues\n> registering their vehicles while others have been getting turned away from\n> the DMV. It would appear that some counties are better than others. This\n> does mean that Texas Kei truck owners are currently in a better position\n> than Kei truck owners in, say, Maine, but it\u2019s still not a great place to\n> be. If you don\u2019t know if your Kei truck will be able to be registered, you\n> may think twice about putting down your hard-earned cash on one.\n>\n> Which is right? Are Kei trucks legal in Texas? According to the January 2024\n> edition of the Texas Vehicle Title Manual, the answer is no:\n>\n> Mini-trucks Vast numbers of used Japanese mini-trucks and vans (also known\n> as Kei-class vehicles) are being imported into the US primarily as off-road\n> vehicles. Some states allow mini-trucks to operate on roadways as low or\n> slow speed vehicles. Mini-trucks are not eligible for title or registration\n> due the vehicle\u2019s lack of compliance with US environmental and safety\n> standards.\n\nThe Texas Vehicle Title Manual then goes on to clarify that Kei trucks do not\nmeet the definition of a motor vehicle, therefore they cannot be titled. The\nconfusing part about that is that Texas law doesn\u2019t appear to support that\nassertion. I could not find a law excluding Kei trucks, mini trucks, or\nimported cars from being classified as motor vehicles. I didn\u2019t even find the\nAAMVA wording that any vehicle not meeting FMVSS should be removed from Texas\nroads. Unlike Maine, Texas did not appear to change its laws, just its DMV\npolicies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis put Texas Kei truck enthusiasts in a weird spot. The DMV\u2019s official\npolicy was to deny the title and registration of Kei trucks, but clearly, not\nall DMV offices have gotten the memo. Now, they could have decided to wait it\nout. As I said above, some people were still reporting success getting their\nKei trucks on the road.\n\nHowever, the Texas Kei Truck Advocates didn\u2019t want to wait for Texas to start\nrevoking titles like the other states are doing. Instead, the enthusiasts\nwanted to get ahead by working with lawmakers to get the DMV policy changed.\nSome people felt that Texans were rocking the boat and they should have just\nleft things alone. The enthusiasts ran the risk of alerting the DMV that some\noffices weren\u2019t following the rules, and thus accidentally end up triggering\nthe statewide ban they were hoping to avoid.\n\nOn the other hand, working with lawmakers instead of working against them\ncould result in success. That was the gamble Texas enthusiasts were willing to\nmake. So, David told me that the Texas Kei Truck Advocates reached out to the\nTexas DMV as well as lawmakers over the state, including Governor Greg Abbott.\nThey approached the situation armed with a multi-page document explaining what\nKei trucks are, how they\u2019re different than 25 mph-limited mini trucks, how the\ntrucks are federally legal, and how banning these vehicles would negatively\nimpact small businesses in the state.\n\nTexas Kei Truck Advocates\n\nIt should also be noted that these bans aren\u2019t being applied equally.\nAccording to the AAMVA, vehicles that were not built to FMVSS are too unsafe\nto drive on American roads. Yet, save for the crackdown in Maine, the logic is\nbeing applied only to tiny Kei vehicles from Japan. I can import a 1999 Smart\nCity Coupe or a Mercedes-Benz A-Class, two European city cars that were never\nbuilt for U.S. roads, but have no problem registering them because they aren\u2019t\nKei cars.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a welcoming turn of events, the Texas DMV did not shut the door with the\nTexas Kei Truck Advocates, but agreed to review its policies.\n\nWhile this was happening, we also reached out to the Texas DMV and to Texas\nState Representative Gene Wu. The DMV didn\u2019t get back to us, but Rep. Wu,\nalong with other lawmakers, flexed some muscles. As a result of all of these\nefforts, Rep. Wu was pleased to announce that Texas will be reversing its\npolicies on Kei truck registration, from Representative Gene Wu on X:\n\nRepresentative Gene Wu\n\nIn a statement, Rep. Wu said:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to the wonderful people at the Texas DMV who took our\n> inquiry seriously, even though it was just a mini-request, and reformulated\n> their policy to include the interest of thousands of Texas automotive\n> enthusiasts, like myself.\u201d\n\nRep. Wu actually understates how big this win actually is. Texas is officially\nthe first state to reverse the damage started in 2021. David is understandably\nvery happy, too. He sent me this message:\n\n> \u201cToday marks a momentous day for Kei truck owners, enthusiasts, and small\n> businesses across Texas. Thanks to the tireless efforts of our grassroots\n> advocacy group, The Texas Kei Truck Advocates, and the support of our\n> passionate community, we have successfully achieved a policy reversal at the\n> Texas Department of Motor Vehicles. As of today, Kei trucks are officially\n> street legal in the Lone Star State.\n>\n> This victory is a testament to the power of civic engagement and the\n> importance of standing up for our rights and freedoms. By engaging with our\n> state legislators, sharing our personal stories, and highlighting the unique\n> value that Kei trucks bring to our lives and communities, we were able to\n> effect meaningful change.\n>\n> We would like to extend a special thank you to state Representatives Will\n> Metcalf and Terry Canales, as well as Senator Brandon Creighton. Their\n> support and advocacy were crucial in helping us achieve this policy\n> reversal. We are grateful for their willingness to listen to our concerns,\n> understand the importance of this issue, and champion our cause at the\n> TxDMV.\n>\n> We also extend our heartfelt gratitude to the TxDMV for their willingness to\n> listen to our concerns, review their policies, and ultimately make the right\n> decision. This policy reversal not only benefits current Kei truck owners\n> but also provides a lifeline to small businesses that deal in Kei trucks.\n> Many of these businesses have faced uncertainty and financial hardship due\n> to the previous restrictions on Kei truck registration and use. Now, they\n> can operate with confidence, knowing that their vehicles are fully legal and\n> recognized by the state.\n>\n> However, our work is not finished. While this policy reversal is a\n> significant step forward, our ultimate goal has always been to secure a\n> state law that protects these trucks once and for all. Policies can be\n> easily changed, but laws provide more certainty and long-term protection. We\n> will continue to work with our legislative allies to draft and pass\n> legislation that enshrines the legality of Kei trucks in Texas statutes.\n>\n> Texas now joins a growing list of states that recognize the value of\n> personal choice and freedom when it comes to vehicle ownership. We hope that\n> our success will inspire other states to follow suit and embrace the\n> diversity of vehicles on our roads.\n>\n> As we celebrate this victory, we remain committed to promoting responsible\n> Kei truck ownership, educating the public about the benefits and limitations\n> of these vehicles, and fostering a supportive community of enthusiasts. We\n> look forward to seeing more Kei trucks on the streets of Texas and to\n> continuing our advocacy efforts to protect and expand the rights of Kei\n> truck owners nationwide.\n>\n> Thank you to everyone who supported us along the way. Together, we have made\n> a difference and shown that when passionate citizens unite behind a common\n> cause anything is possible. Let us carry this momentum forward as we work to\n> secure permanent legal protection for Kei trucks in Texas.\u201d\n\nTexas Kei Truck Advocates\n\nI mention that Texas is the first to beat the 2021 AAMVA rules because\ntechnically, there have been earlier victories in other states before the\nAAMVA\u2019s rules came out. David gives me the example of North Carolina, where in\n2019, Kei truck dealer Mayberry Mini Trucks as well as other advocates managed\nto convince North Carolina to keep Keis legal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo, what\u2019s next? Texas will publish its latest edition of the Texas Vehicle\nTitle Manual, which should have no mention of Kei trucks being unable to be\ntitled, if it even mentions Kei trucks and mini trucks at all. Thankfully,\nTexas did not get to the point of revoking titles, so now, enthusiasts should\nbe able to go to their local DMV and get a title and registration.\n\n\u201cI would encourage every car nut and gearhead to reach out to your elected\nofficials during this year\u2019s election cycle. Let them know you exist and that\nyou matter,\u201d said Representative Wu.\n\nHopefully, what we\u2019re seeing in Texas is only the beginning. There\u2019s still a\nlong road ahead for enthusiasts in other states. It will be an especially\ndifficult battle in states where the laws were changed to ban imported\nvehicles. However, perhaps some of them might find some luck in banding\ntogether with lawmakers. For now, Kei truck fans in Texas can breathe a sigh\nof relief. It would appear the AAMVA just learned that you do not mess with\nTexas.\n\n  * Five Terrific Auto-Repair YouTube Channels You\u2019re (Probably) Sleeping On\n\n  * New Owner Of The Legendary \u2018Chicago Cutlass\u2019 Rustbucket Describes What\u2019s Broken, And It\u2019s A Lot\n\n  * How The Small Car Died In America\n\n  * Why This One NASCAR Track Is So Hard On Tires, And How This Completely Changes A Driver\u2019s Strategy\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n  * BigFeatured, Car Imports, car laws, Georgia, Import Ban, imports, JDM, kei cars, kei trucks, lawtopian, Maine, mitsubishi delica, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, texas\n\nShare on facebook\n\nFacebook\n\nShare on whatsapp\n\nWhatsApp\n\nShare on twitter\n\nTwitter\n\nShare on linkedin\n\nLinkedIn\n\nShare on reddit\n\nReddit\n\n#### Mercedes Streeter\n\nMercedes is a lifelong fan of all things powered by an engine.

If I\nwant a Kei truck or a VW Toaureg I should be able to import a new or lightly\nused one if it complies with US emission standards regardless of age. It\u2019s not\na danger to anyone. And if selling them is the issue brand the title as a\n\u201cforeign vehicle\u201d and make it clear it doesn\u2019t adhere to US safety standards\nand it\u2019s risky to buy it without proper research.\n\n0\n\nTsorel\n\n13 hours ago\n\nReply to SomeIntern\n\nUnfortunately, these vehicles do not comply with US emission standards, if\nthey have never been tested federally.\n\n0\n\nMikkeli\n\n1 day ago\n\nI had wondered if anyone would push bac; very similar facts as OAG opinion\nKP-0202.\n\n0\n\nSam Gross\n\n1 day ago\n\nWhat really pokes a hole in the safety argument is the fact that Kei trucks\nare really only dangerous to the operators.

I really was not trying to upset anyone, rile\nanyone up, or to cause any offense. As someone that lives in Texas, I was\nreally just pointing out the absurdity of what things the state government\nchooses to focus on when it comes to safety. Some small vehicles that don\u2019t\nreally fit modern safety standards coming into the state warrants a lot of\ngovernment involvement and worries/concerns/legislation/talks about safety\nstart happening, but when my son spends two and a half hours huddled in the\nback of a store fearing for his life because there\u2019s a guy walking around the\nmall literally shooting and killing people, the only thing state government\nhas to offer is thoughts and prayers. If you feel like people talking about\nthe state laws surrounding safety should only involve cars since that was the\npoint of this article, I can certainly understand where you\u2019re coming from. I\ntend to interlink the ideas of safety here in Texas with things like gun laws\ndue to personal experience, but I can see how that may not be welcome to\neveryone. Again, I really wasn\u2019t trying to upset or offend\n\n0\n\nPresterJohn\n\n1 day ago\n\nReply to ChefCJ\n\nYours was the main comment I was referring to, yes. I was not personally\noffended in the slightest by your comment, I just don\u2019t think it belongs on\nthis site.\n\nI can certainly see where you might hold those views as a resident of Texas\nand you should not feel bad for holding them, but dropping that missive on a\nniche interest site like theautopian.com does absolutely nothing to further\nyour goal of changing how your state government operates when it comes to\ngeneral safety.\n\nWhat it does do is cause a bunch of rage from people who are offended when\nthey see that kind of thing which lowers the overall quality of the comment\nsection on here and turns off the people who are hoping to read stuff about\ncars. I don\u2019t know if you were or are a reader of Jalopnik, but this is\nexactly what ruined that site for me. I have felt that the Autopian\u2019s core\nvalue of \u201cpro-car\u201d is in direct response to what Jalopnik became, which was in\nmany ways, pro-politics and anti-car. That\u2019s not to say the site shies away\nfrom politics when it overlaps, but I\u2019ve been generally happy with the way\nthat\u2019s been handled here.\n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t a personal attack in any way, just growing pains of the site\nwhere comments like that wouldn\u2019t previously have been an issue when the site\nwas small. Now that it\u2019s growing, there are more people that could see a\ncomment like that and end up taking over the comment section.\n\n0\n\nChefCJ\n\n1 day ago\n\nReply to PresterJohn\n\nIn my defense, look at that banner picture- I see that flag everyday on the\nback of a truck, the only thing changing being what type of weapon is right\nnext to the Come and Take It. It\u2019s hard not to associate that flag with people\nadvocating for gun rights when that\u2019s the reason it gets flown.\n\nAt the same time, I really do understand your point, and I was also a long\ntime reader on jalopnik and hated the immediacy of the comments section to get\nderailed into annoying political conversations. I\u2019ve never really made a\npolitical comment on a website before, let alone one about loving cars. That\none just hit home since it\u2019s something I deal with on an unfortunately regular\nbasis.\n\n0\n\nMercedes Streeter\n\n1 day ago\n\nReply to PresterJohn\n\nWe try to be a bit open with comments here, so long as they don\u2019t get too\nnasty. The \u201cline\u201d we have drawn at the moment is when off-topic comments begin\nto attack regular people, like a minority group. The writers of Jalopnik are\nalso a popular punching bag, and we aren\u2019t really the site for trying to kick\nour former co-workers.\n\nFor now, we\u2019re ok with people blowing off some steam about their elected\nofficials. Those are public figures fully open to blowback from their\nconstituents.\n\nLast edited 1 day ago by Mercedes Streeter\n\n1\n\nDavid McChristian\n\n1 day ago\n\nReply to Mercedes Streeter\n\nDo you have any plans to dig into the AAMVA any further?

I do think your vision for moderation on this site\ndeserves an article though.\n\nI disagree that contrasting this site with Jalopnik is somehow attacking your\nformer coworkers. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re fine people, but the environment they\nallowed to flourish is part of the reason this site is successful \u2013 there\nexists a critical mass of people who are not getting what they want there. I\ndo agree it\u2019s not appropriate to bring that up all the time, but this was one\nof those instances where it made sense. I have yet to see a personal attack\nagainst them here.\n\nAlso, with a membership model you\u2019re going to have people that feel more\ninvested in the site, they\u2019ve literally invested. With that in mind, you can\nexpect these issues will come to a head at some point. Deciding before then on\na more comprehensive moderation policy goes hand in hand with defining values\nas a site.\n\n0\n\nChronometric\n\n1 day ago\n\nTake note Georgia.\n\n7\n\nDanangme69\n\n1 day ago\n\nI\u2019d like to see a video of a head on with a King Ranch or Suburban both\neverywhere you look in Texas.
