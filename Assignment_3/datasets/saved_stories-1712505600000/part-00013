The drone is equipped with a\nrobust onboard perception and navigation system that enables it to locate\npowerlines and approach them for landing. A passively actuated gripping\nmechanism grasps the powerline cable during landing after which a control\ncircuit regulates the magnetic field inside a split-core current transformer\nto provide sufficient holding force as well as battery recharging.\n\nThe system is evaluated in an active outdoor three-phase powerline\nenvironment. We demonstrate multiple contiguous hours of fully autonomous\nuninterrupted drone operations composed of several cycles of flying, landing,\nrecharging, and takeoff, validating the capability of extended, essentially\nunlimited, operational endurance.\n\nOriginal language| English  \n---|---  \nTitle of host publication| The 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics\nand Automation (ICRA2024)  \nPublisher| International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)  \nPublication status| E-pub ahead of print - 2024  \n  \n## Documents & Links\n\n  * Open Access VersionAccepted manuscript, 5.79 MB\n\n## Other files and links\n\n  * Video\n\n## Fingerprint\n\nDive into the research topics of 'Autonomous Overhead Powerline Recharging for\nUninterrupted Drone Operations'.
