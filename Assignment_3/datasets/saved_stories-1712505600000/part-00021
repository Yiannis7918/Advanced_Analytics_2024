Buy it\nhere. (Or see a preview.)\n\n___________\n\nEveryone feels something when they\u2019re in a really good starry place on a\nreally good starry night and they look up and see this:\n\nSome people stick with the traditional, feeling struck by the epic beauty or\nblown away by the insane scale of the universe. Personally, I go for the old\n\u201cexistential meltdown followed by acting weird for the next half hour.\u201d But\neveryone feels something.\n\nPhysicist Enrico Fermi felt something too\u2014\u201dWhere is everybody?\u201d\n\n________________\n\nA really starry sky seems vast\u2014but all we\u2019re looking at is our very local\nneighborhood. On the very best nights, we can see up to about 2,500 stars\n(roughly one hundred-millionth of the stars in our galaxy), and almost all of\nthem are less than 1,000 light years away from us (or 1% of the diameter of\nthe Milky Way). So what we\u2019re really looking at is this:\n\nGalaxy image: Nick Risinger\n\nWhen confronted with the topic of stars and galaxies, a question that\ntantalizes most humans is, \u201cIs there other intelligent life out there?\u201d Let\u2019s\nput some numbers to it\u2014\n\nAs many stars as there are in our galaxy (100 \u2013 400 billion), there are\nroughly an equal number of galaxies in the observable universe\u2014so for every\nstar in the colossal Milky Way, there\u2019s a whole galaxy out there. All\ntogether, that comes out to the typically quoted range of between 10^22 and\n10^24 total stars, which means that for every grain of sand on every beach on\nEarth, there are 10,000 stars out there.\n\nThe science world isn\u2019t in total agreement about what percentage of those\nstars are \u201csun-like\u201d (similar in size, temperature, and luminosity)\u2014opinions\ntypically range from 5% to 20%. Going with the most conservative side of that\n(5%), and the lower end for the number of total stars (10^22), gives us 500\nquintillion, or 500 billion billion sun-like stars.\n\nThere\u2019s also a debate over what percentage of those sun-like stars might be\norbited by an Earth-like planet (one with similar temperature conditions that\ncould have liquid water and potentially support life similar to that on\nEarth). Some say it\u2019s as high as 50%, but let\u2019s go with the more conservative\n22% that came out of a recent PNAS study. That suggests that there\u2019s a\npotentially-habitable Earth-like planet orbiting at least 1% of the total\nstars in the universe\u2014a total of 100 billion billion Earth-like planets.\n\nSo there are 100 Earth-like planets for every grain of sand in the world.\nThink about that next time you\u2019re on the beach.\n\nMoving forward, we have no choice but to get completely speculative. Let\u2019s\nimagine that after billions of years in existence, 1% of Earth-like planets\ndevelop life (if that\u2019s true, every grain of sand would represent one planet\nwith life on it). And imagine that on 1% of those planets, the life advances\nto an intelligent level like it did here on Earth. That would mean there were\n10 quadrillion, or 10 million billion intelligent civilizations in the\nobservable universe.\n\nMoving back to just our galaxy, and doing the same math on the lowest estimate\nfor stars in the Milky Way (100 billion), we\u2019d estimate that there are 1\nbillion Earth-like planets and 100,000 intelligent civilizations in our\ngalaxy.1\n\nSETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) is an organization dedicated\nto listening for signals from other intelligent life. If we\u2019re right that\nthere are 100,000 or more intelligent civilizations in our galaxy, and even a\nfraction of them are sending out radio waves or laser beams or other modes of\nattempting to contact others, shouldn\u2019t SETI\u2019s satellite dish array pick up\nall kinds of signals?\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t. Not one. Ever.\n\nWhere is everybody?\n\nIt gets stranger. Our sun is relatively young in the lifespan of the universe.\nThere are far older stars with far older Earth-like planets, which should in\ntheory mean civilizations far more advanced than our own. As an example, let\u2019s\ncompare our 4.54-billion-year-old Earth to a hypothetical 8-billion-year-old\nPlanet X.\n\nIf Planet X has a similar story to Earth, let\u2019s look at where their\ncivilization would be today (using the orange timespan as a reference to show\nhow huge the green timespan is):\n\nThe technology and knowledge of a civilization only 1,000 years ahead of us\ncould be as shocking to us as our world would be to a medieval person. A\ncivilization 1 million years ahead of us might be as incomprehensible to us as\nhuman culture is to chimpanzees. And Planet X is 3.4 billion years ahead of\nus...\n\nThere\u2019s something called The Kardashev Scale, which helps us group intelligent\ncivilizations into three broad categories by the amount of energy they use:\n\nA Type I Civilization has the ability to use all of the energy on their\nplanet. We\u2019re not quite a Type I Civilization, but we\u2019re close (Carl Sagan\ncreated a formula for this scale which puts us at a Type 0.7 Civilization).\n\nA Type II Civilization can harness all of the energy of their host star. Our\nfeeble Type I brains can hardly imagine how someone would do this, but we\u2019ve\ntried our best, imagining things like a Dyson Sphere.\n\nA Type III Civilization blows the other two away, accessing power comparable\nto that of the entire Milky Way galaxy.\n\nIf this level of advancement sounds hard to believe, remember Planet X above\nand their 3.4 billion years of further development. If a civilization on\nPlanet X were similar to ours and were able to survive all the way to Type III\nlevel, the natural thought is that they\u2019d probably have mastered inter-stellar\ntravel by now, possibly even colonizing the entire galaxy.\n\nOne hypothesis as to how galactic colonization could happen is by creating\nmachinery that can travel to other planets, spend 500 years or so self-\nreplicating using the raw materials on their new planet, and then send two\nreplicas off to do the same thing. Even without traveling anywhere near the\nspeed of light, this process would colonize the whole galaxy in 3.75 million\nyears, a relative blink of an eye when talking in the scale of billions of\nyears:\n\nSource: Scientific American: \u201cWhere Are They\u201d\n\nContinuing to speculate, if 1% of intelligent life survives long enough to\nbecome a potentially galaxy-colonizing Type III Civilization, our calculations\nabove suggest that there should be at least 1,000 Type III Civilizations in\nour galaxy alone\u2014and given the power of such a civilization, their presence\nwould likely be pretty noticeable. And yet, we see nothing, hear nothing, and\nwe\u2019re visited by no one.\n\nSo where is everybody?\n\n_____________________\n\nWelcome to the Fermi Paradox.\n\nWe have no answer to the Fermi Paradox\u2014the best we can do is \u201cpossible\nexplanations.\u201d And if you ask ten different scientists what their hunch is\nabout the correct one, you\u2019ll get ten different answers. You know when you\nhear about humans of the past debating whether the Earth was round or if the\nsun revolved around the Earth or thinking that lightning happened because of\nZeus, and they seem so primitive and in the dark? That\u2019s about where we are\nwith this topic.\n\nIn taking a look at some of the most-discussed possible explanations for the\nFermi Paradox, let\u2019s divide them into two broad categories\u2014those explanations\nwhich assume that there\u2019s no sign of Type II and Type III Civilizations\nbecause there are none of them out there, and those which assume they\u2019re out\nthere and we\u2019re not seeing or hearing anything for other reasons.\n\nExplanation Group 1: There are no signs of higher (Type II and III)\ncivilizations because there are no higher civilizations in existence.\n\nThose who subscribe to Group 1 explanations point to something called the non-\nexclusivity problem, which rebuffs any theory that says, \u201cThere are higher\ncivilizations, but none of them have made any kind of contact with us because\nthey all _____.\u201d Group 1 people look at the math, which says there should be\nso many thousands (or millions) of higher civilizations, that at least one of\nthem would be an exception to the rule. Even if a theory held for 99.99% of\nhigher civilizations, the other .01% would behave differently and we\u2019d become\naware of their existence.\n\nTherefore, say Group 1 explanations, it must be that there are no super-\nadvanced civilizations. And since the math suggests that there are thousands\nof them just in our own galaxy, something else must be going on.\n\nThis something else is called The Great Filter.\n\nThe Great Filter theory says that at some point from pre-life to Type III\nintelligence, there\u2019s a wall that all or nearly all attempts at life hit.\nThere\u2019s some stage in that long evolutionary process that is extremely\nunlikely or impossible for life to get beyond. That stage is The Great Filter.\n\nIf this theory is true, the big question is, Where in the timeline does the\nGreat Filter occur?\n\nIt turns out that when it comes to the fate of humankind, this question is\nvery important. Depending on where The Great Filter occurs, we\u2019re left with\nthree possible realities: We\u2019re rare, we\u2019re first, or we\u2019re fucked.\n\n1\\. We\u2019re Rare (The Great Filter is Behind Us)\n\nOne hope we have is that The Great Filter is behind us\u2014we managed to surpass\nit, which would mean it\u2019s extremely rare for life to make it to our level of\nintelligence. The diagram below shows only two species making it past, and\nwe\u2019re one of them.\n\nThis scenario would explain why there are no Type III Civilizations...but it\nwould also mean that we could be one of the few exceptions now that we\u2019ve made\nit this far. It would mean we have hope. On the surface, this sounds a bit\nlike people 500 years ago suggesting that the Earth is the center of the\nuniverse\u2014it implies that we\u2019re special. However, something scientists call\n\u201cobservation selection effect\u201d suggests that anyone who is pondering their own\nrarity is inherently part of an intelligent life \u201csuccess story\u201d\u2014and whether\nthey\u2019re actually rare or quite common, the thoughts they ponder and\nconclusions they draw will be identical. This forces us to admit that being\nspecial is at least a possibility.\n\nAnd if we are special, when exactly did we become special\u2014i.e. which step did\nwe surpass that almost everyone else gets stuck on?\n\nOne possibility: The Great Filter could be at the very beginning\u2014it might be\nincredibly unusual for life to begin at all. This is a candidate because it\ntook about a billion years of Earth\u2019s existence to finally happen, and because\nwe have tried extensively to replicate that event in labs and have never been\nable to do it. If this is indeed The Great Filter, it would mean that not only\nis there no intelligent life out there, there may be no other life at all.\n\nAnother possibility: The Great Filter could be the jump from the simple\nprokaryote cell to the complex eukaryote cell. After prokaryotes came into\nbeing, they remained that way for almost two billion years before making the\nevolutionary jump to being complex and having a nucleus. If this is The Great\nFilter, it would mean the universe is teeming with simple prokaryote cells and\nalmost nothing beyond that.\n\nThere are a number of other possibilities\u2014some even think the most recent leap\nwe\u2019ve made to our current intelligence is a Great Filter candidate. While the\nleap from semi-intelligent life (chimps) to intelligent life (humans) doesn\u2019t\nat first seem like a miraculous step, Steven Pinker rejects the idea of an\ninevitable \u201cclimb upward\u201d of evolution: \u201cSince evolution does not strive for a\ngoal but just happens, it uses the adaptation most useful for a given\necological niche, and the fact that, on Earth, this led to technological\nintelligence only once so far may suggest that this outcome of natural\nselection is rare and hence by no means a certain development of the evolution\nof a tree of life.\u201d\n\nMost leaps do not qualify as Great Filter candidates. Any possible Great\nFilter must be one-in-a-billion type thing where one or more total freak\noccurrences need to happen to provide a crazy exception\u2014for that reason,\nsomething like the jump from single-cell to multi-cellular life is ruled out,\nbecause it has occurred as many as 46 times, in isolated incidents, just on\nthis planet alone. For the same reason, if we were to find a fossilized\neukaryote cell on Mars, it would rule the above \u201csimple-to-complex cell\u201d leap\nout as a possible Great Filter (as well as anything before that point on the\nevolutionary chain)\u2014because if it happened on both Earth and Mars, it\u2019s almost\ndefinitely not a one-in-a-billion freak occurrence.\n\nIf we are indeed rare, it could be because of a fluky biological event, but it\nalso could be attributed to what is called the Rare Earth Hypothesis, which\nsuggests that though there may be many Earth-like planets, the particular\nconditions on Earth\u2014whether related to the specifics of this solar system, its\nrelationship with the moon (a moon that large is unusual for such a small\nplanet and contributes to our particular weather and ocean conditions), or\nsomething about the planet itself\u2014are exceptionally friendly to life.\n\n2\\. We\u2019re the First\n\nFor Group 1 Thinkers, if the Great Filter is not behind us, the one hope we\nhave is that conditions in the universe are just recently, for the first time\nsince the Big Bang, reaching a place that would allow intelligent life to\ndevelop. In that case, we and many other species may be on our way to super-\nintelligence, and it simply hasn\u2019t happened yet. We happen to be here at the\nright time to become one of the first super-intelligent civilizations.\n\nOne example of a phenomenon that could make this realistic is the prevalence\nof gamma-ray bursts, insanely huge explosions that we\u2019ve observed in distant\ngalaxies. In the same way that it took the early Earth a few hundred million\nyears before the asteroids and volcanoes died down and life became possible,\nit could be that the first chunk of the universe\u2019s existence was full of\ncataclysmic events like gamma-ray bursts that would incinerate everything\nnearby from time to time and prevent any life from developing past a certain\nstage. Now, perhaps, we\u2019re in the midst of an astrobiological phase transition\nand this is the first time any life has been able to evolve for this long,\nuninterrupted.\n\n3\\. We\u2019re Fucked (The Great Filter is Ahead of Us)\n\nIf we\u2019re neither rare nor early, Group 1 thinkers conclude that The Great\nFilter must be in our future. This would suggest that life regularly evolves\nto where we are, but that something prevents life from going much further and\nreaching high intelligence in almost all cases\u2014and we\u2019re unlikely to be an\nexception.\n\nOne possible future Great Filter is a regularly-occurring cataclysmic natural\nevent, like the above-mentioned gamma-ray bursts, except they\u2019re unfortunately\nnot done yet and it\u2019s just a matter of time before all life on Earth is\nsuddenly wiped out by one. Another candidate is the possible inevitability\nthat nearly all intelligent civilizations end up destroying themselves once a\ncertain level of technology is reached.\n\nThis is why Oxford University philosopher Nick Bostrom says that \u201cno news is\ngood news.\u201d The discovery of even simple life on Mars would be devastating,\nbecause it would cut out a number of potential Great Filters behind us. And if\nwe were to find fossilized complex life on Mars, Bostrom says \u201cit would be by\nfar the worst news ever printed on a newspaper cover,\u201d because it would mean\nThe Great Filter is almost definitely ahead of us\u2014ultimately dooming the\nspecies. Bostrom believes that when it comes to The Fermi Paradox, \u201cthe\nsilence of the night sky is golden.\u201d\n\nExplanation Group 2: Type II and III intelligent civilizations are out\nthere\u2014and there are logical reasons why we might not have heard from them.\n\nGroup 2 explanations get rid of any notion that we\u2019re rare or special or the\nfirst at anything\u2014on the contrary, they believe in the Mediocrity Principle,\nwhose starting point is that there is nothing unusual or rare about our\ngalaxy, solar system, planet, or level of intelligence, until evidence proves\notherwise. They\u2019re also much less quick to assume that the lack of evidence of\nhigher intelligence beings is evidence of their nonexistence\u2014emphasizing the\nfact that our search for signals stretches only about 100 light years away\nfrom us (0.1% across the galaxy) and suggesting a number of possible\nexplanations. Here are 10:\n\nPossibility 1) Super-intelligent life could very well have already visited\nEarth, but before we were here. In the scheme of things, sentient humans have\nonly been around for about 50,000 years, a little blip of time. If contact\nhappened before then, it might have made some ducks flip out and run into the\nwater and that\u2019s it. Further, recorded history only goes back 5,500 years\u2014a\ngroup of ancient hunter-gatherer tribes may have experienced some crazy alien\nshit, but they had no good way to tell anyone in the future about it.\n\nPossibility 2) The galaxy has been colonized, but we just live in some\ndesolate rural area of the galaxy. The Americas may have been colonized by\nEuropeans long before anyone in a small Inuit tribe in far northern Canada\nrealized it had happened. There could be an urbanization component to the\ninterstellar dwellings of higher species, in which all the neighboring solar\nsystems in a certain area are colonized and in communication, and it would be\nimpractical and purposeless for anyone to deal with coming all the way out to\nthe random part of the spiral where we live.\n\nPossibility 3) The entire concept of physical colonization is a hilariously\nbackward concept to a more advanced species. Remember the picture of the Type\nII Civilization above with the sphere around their star? With all that energy,\nthey might have created a perfect environment for themselves that satisfies\ntheir every need. They might have crazy-advanced ways of reducing their need\nfor resources and zero interest in leaving their happy utopia to explore the\ncold, empty, undeveloped universe.\n\nAn even more advanced civilization might view the entire physical world as a\nhorribly primitive place, having long ago conquered their own biology and\nuploaded their brains to a virtual reality, eternal-life paradise. Living in\nthe physical world of biology, mortality, wants, and needs might seem to them\nthe way we view primitive ocean species living in the frigid, dark sea. FYI,\nthinking about another life form having bested mortality makes me incredibly\njealous and upset.\n\nPossibility 4) There are scary predator civilizations out there, and most\nintelligent life knows better than to broadcast any outgoing signals and\nadvertise their location. This is an unpleasant concept and would help explain\nthe lack of any signals being received by the SETI satellites. It also means\nthat we might be the super naive newbies who are being unbelievably stupid and\nrisky by ever broadcasting outward signals. There\u2019s a debate going on\ncurrently about whether we should engage in METI (Messaging to\nExtraterrestrial Intelligence\u2014the reverse of SETI) or not, and most people say\nwe should not. Stephen Hawking warns, \u201cIf aliens visit us, the outcome would\nbe much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn\u2019t turn out well for the\nNative Americans.\u201d Even Carl Sagan (a general believer that any civilization\nadvanced enough for interstellar travel would be altruistic, not hostile)\ncalled the practice of METI \u201cdeeply unwise and immature,\u201d and recommended that\n\u201cthe newest children in a strange and uncertain cosmos should listen quietly\nfor a long time, patiently learning about the universe and comparing notes,\nbefore shouting into an unknown jungle that we do not understand.\u201d Scary.1\n\nPossibility 5) There\u2019s only one instance of higher-intelligent life\u2014a\n\u201csuperpredator\u201d civilization (like humans are here on Earth)\u2014that is far more\nadvanced than everyone else and keeps it that way by exterminating any\nintelligent civilization once they get past a certain level. This would suck.\nThe way it might work is that it\u2019s an inefficient use of resources to\nexterminate all emerging intelligences, maybe because most die out on their\nown. But past a certain point, the super beings make their move\u2014because to\nthem, an emerging intelligent species becomes like a virus as it starts to\ngrow and spread. This theory suggests that whoever was the first in the galaxy\nto reach intelligence won, and now no one else has a chance. This would\nexplain the lack of activity out there because it would keep the number of\nsuper-intelligent civilizations to just one.\n\nPossibility 6) There\u2019s plenty of activity and noise out there, but our\ntechnology is too primitive and we\u2019re listening for the wrong things. Like\nwalking into a modern-day office building, turning on a walkie-talkie, and\nwhen you hear no activity (which of course you wouldn\u2019t hear because\neveryone\u2019s texting, not using walkie-talkies), determining that the building\nmust be empty. Or maybe, as Carl Sagan has pointed out, it could be that our\nminds work exponentially faster or slower than another form of intelligence\nout there\u2014e.g. it takes them 12 years to say \u201cHello,\u201d and when we hear that\ncommunication, it just sounds like white noise to us.\n\nPossibility 7) We are receiving contact from other intelligent life, but the\ngovernment is hiding it. The more I learn about the topic, the more this seems\nlike an idiotic theory, but I had to mention it because it\u2019s talked about so\nmuch.\n\nPossibility 8) Higher civilizations are aware of us and observing us (AKA the\n\u201cZoo Hypothesis\u201d). As far as we know, super-intelligent civilizations exist in\na tightly-regulated galaxy, and our Earth is treated like part of a vast and\nprotected national park, with a strict \u201cLook but don\u2019t touch\u201d rule for planets\nlike ours. We wouldn\u2019t notice them, because if a far smarter species wanted to\nobserve us, it would know how to easily do so without us realizing it. Maybe\nthere\u2019s a rule similar to the Star Trek\u2019s \u201cPrime Directive\u201d which prohibits\nsuper-intelligent beings from making any open contact with lesser species like\nus or revealing themselves in any way, until the lesser species has reached a\ncertain level of intelligence.\n\nPossibility 9) Higher civilizations are here, all around us. But we\u2019re too\nprimitive to perceive them. Michio Kaku sums it up like this:\n\nLet\u2019s say we have an anthill in the middle of the forest. And right next to\nthe anthill, they\u2019re building a ten-lane super-highway. And the question is\n\u201cWould the ants be able to understand what a ten-lane super-highway is? Would\nthe ants be able to understand the technology and the intentions of the beings\nbuilding the highway next to them?\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s not that we can\u2019t pick up the signals from Planet X using our\ntechnology, it\u2019s that we can\u2019t even comprehend what the beings from Planet X\nare or what they\u2019re trying to do. It\u2019s so beyond us that even if they really\nwanted to enlighten us, it would be like trying to teach ants about the\ninternet.\n\nAlong those lines, this may also be an answer to \u201cWell if there are so many\nfancy Type III Civilizations, why haven\u2019t they contacted us yet?\u201d To answer\nthat, let\u2019s ask ourselves\u2014when Pizarro made his way into Peru, did he stop for\na while at an anthill to try to communicate? Was he magnanimous, trying to\nhelp the ants in the anthill? Did he become hostile and slow his original\nmission down in order to smash the anthill apart? Or was the anthill of\ncomplete and utter and eternal irrelevance to Pizarro? That might be our\nsituation here.\n\nPossibility 10) We\u2019re completely wrong about our reality. There are a lot of\nways we could just be totally off with everything we think. The universe might\nappear one way and be something else entirely, like a hologram. Or maybe we\u2019re\nthe aliens and we were planted here as an experiment or as a form of\nfertilizer. There\u2019s even a chance that we\u2019re all part of a computer simulation\nby some researcher from another world, and other forms of life simply weren\u2019t\nprogrammed into the simulation.\n\n________________\n\nAs we continue along with our possibly-futile search for extraterrestrial\nintelligence, I\u2019m not really sure what I\u2019m rooting for. Frankly, learning\neither that we\u2019re officially alone in the universe or that we\u2019re officially\njoined by others would be creepy, which is a theme with all of the surreal\nstorylines listed above\u2014whatever the truth actually is, it\u2019s mindblowing.\n\nBeyond its shocking science fiction component, The Fermi Paradox also leaves\nme with a deep humbling. Not just the normal \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m microscopic and my\nexistence lasts for three seconds\u201d humbling that the universe always triggers.\nThe Fermi Paradox brings out a sharper, more personal humbling, one that can\nonly happen after spending hours of research hearing your species\u2019 most\nrenowned scientists present insane theories, change their minds again and\nagain, and wildly contradict each other\u2014reminding us that future generations\nwill look at us the same way we see the ancient people who were sure that the\nstars were the underside of the dome of heaven, and they\u2019ll think \u201cWow they\nreally had no idea what was going on.\u201d\n\nCompounding all of this is the blow to our species\u2019 self-esteem that comes\nwith all of this talk about Type II and III Civilizations. Here on Earth,\nwe\u2019re the king of our little castle, proud ruler of the huge group of\nimbeciles who share the planet with us. And in this bubble with no competition\nand no one to judge us, it\u2019s rare that we\u2019re ever confronted with the concept\nof being a dramatically inferior species to anyone. But after spending a lot\nof time with Type II and III Civilizations over the past week, our power and\npride are seeming a bit David Brent-esque.\n\nThat said, given that my normal outlook is that humanity is a lonely orphan on\na tiny rock in the middle of a desolate universe, the humbling fact that we\u2019re\nprobably not as smart as we think we are, and the possibility that a lot of\nwhat we\u2019re sure about might be wrong, sounds wonderful. It opens the door just\na crack that maybe, just maybe, there might be more to the story than we\nrealize.\n\nThree more Wait But Why mind-benders:\n\nHow (and Why) SpaceX Will Colonize Mars \u2013 A post I got to work on with Elon\nMusk and one that reframed my mental picture of the future.\n\nThe AI Revolution: Road to Superintelligence \u2013 Why any aliens that do visit us\nare likely to be artificial, not biological.
