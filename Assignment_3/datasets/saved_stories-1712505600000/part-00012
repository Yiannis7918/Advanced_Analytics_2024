Photo \u00a9 Max Touhey\n\nApril 3, 2024\n\nDowntown Brooklyn\u2019s 2004 rezoning delivered seismic change to the longtime\ncommercial and political heart of the New York City borough, as towers such as\nFX Collaborative\u2019s 1 Willoughby Square and Fogarty Finger\u2019s recently completed\n141 Willoughby, sprout upwards to ever greater heights. In a report issued in\n2023 by the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, a local non-profit development\ncorporation, it is estimated that the spate of construction has yielded over\n20,500 residential units to the neighborhood. The Brooklyn Tower, designed by\nSHoP Architects, is the most conspicuous product of this development boom; at\n1,066-feet tall, it looms over the borough from its perch on Flatbush Avenue.\nHowever, like Icarus, it appears that the supertall\u2019s developer Michael Stern,\nfounder of JDS Development, flew a bit too close to the sun, and has defaulted\non a $240 million mezzanine loan for the project, which now faces foreclosure.\n\nJDS Development barnstormed New York City\u2019s real estate scene nearly a decade\nago with two signature projects: the residential conversion by CetraRuddy of\nthe Ralph Walker-designed New York Telephone Company in Chelsea and the SHoP-\ndesigned American Copper Building along the East River. In 2022, in another\ncollaboration with SHoP, JDS Development opened the 1,428-foot-tall Steinway\nTower on Manhattan\u2019s Billionaire\u2019s Row, known as the world\u2019s skinniest\nskyscraper. It, too, faced foreclosure in 2017 due to a $325 million mezzanine\nloan, before JDS Development scrapped together a new financing package. The\nBrooklyn Tower, also completed in 2022 as a mix of rentals and luxury condos,\nrises adjacent to the Beaux-Arts Dime Savings Bank (1908), whose hexagonal\nform is mirrored, and stretched, by the development. And, like JDS\nDevelopment\u2019s other projects\u2014Steinway Tower has a Neo-Art Deco vibe\u2014it stands\nout as something of a Neo-Gothic edifice, harkening back to New York City\u2019s\nfamiliar early 20^th-century landmarks.\n\nMichael Stern is not alone in his financial problems. The Federal Reserve\u2019s\ncontinued battle against inflation relies on higher interest rates and\nquantitative tightening, which impels developers to refinance their mountains\nof debt under less than favorable terms, throwing entire business models out\nof whack. The Brooklyn Tower is scheduled for foreclosure auction on June\n10^th.\n\nKEYWORDS: Brooklyn New York City\n\n### Share This Story\n\nMatthew Marani is Special Sections Editor at Architectural Record.
