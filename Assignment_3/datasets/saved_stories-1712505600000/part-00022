Tesla last unveiled a new vehicle back in\nNovember 2019 when they showed off the Cybertruck for the first time. Before\nthat, they unveiled the Roadster 2.0 and the Tesla Semi at the same event in\n2017, so these certainly special times that only come across once every few\nyears.\n\nWhile it's always possible that Tesla may have to move the Robotaxi's unveil\ndate, it's exciting to think that Tesla may be just four months from unveiling\nthis next-gen vehicle.\n\n## Robotaxi and Next-gen Vehicle\n\nAnother piece of information came out about the Robotaxi yesterday when Musk\nreply to the post by Sawyer Merritt. Sawyer posted that Tesla's upcoming\n\"$25k\" vehicle and the Robotaxi would not only be based on the same platform,\nbut that the Robotaxi would essentially be the same vehicle without a steering\nwheel. Musk replied to the post with a simple \"looking\" emoji.\n\nWhile it's not surprising that two of Tesla's smaller upcoming vehicles are\ngoing to be built on the same platform, it's a little more interesting that\nMusk chose to reply with that emoji when the post talks about the Robotaxi\nbeing the \"Model 2\" without a steering wheel. This leads to the possibility of\nTesla not only showing off the Robotaxi at the August 8th event, but also it's\nupcoming next-gen car.\n\n## Production Date\n\nBack during Tesla's Q1 2022 earnings call, Musk talked a little about the\ntimeline for Tesla's Robotaxi, stating that they plan to announce the vehicle\nin 2023 and begin mass production in 2024.\n\nGiven that Tesla was originally aiming for a 2023 unveil, a late 2024 date\nappears realistic. However, now it appears that the Robotaxi and the next-gen\nvehicle will share a lot in common, meaning that a production date for the\nRobotaxi can be similar to the next-gen vehicle, which is currently slated to\nbegin in \"late 2025\".\n\nThe difficulty in releasing an autonomous taxi, as the Robotaxi is meant to\nbe, is the self-driving aspect. While Tesla has made great strides with FSD\nv12, the first version to come out of \"beta,\" it's still a level-2 system that\nrequires active driver supervision. A fully autonomous vehicle is still a big\nleap from where Tesla's FSD is right now, but as we saw with the jump from FSD\nv11 to v12, a lot can change in the next 18 to 24 months.\n\nWhile we expect Tesla to remain focused on bringing its cheaper, next-gen\nvehicle to market ahead of potential competitors, the Robotaxi's production\ndate can continue to shift in line with Tesla's progress on FSD.\n\n> ?\n>\n> \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 5, 2024\n\n## Master Plan Part Deux\n\nThe history of Tesla\u2019s Robotaxi starts with CEO Elon Musk's Master Plan Part\nDeux, published in 2016.\n\nAt the time the concept was touted as normal Teslas with full self-driving\n(FSD) capability.\n\nOnce Tesla achieved Full Self-Driving, they would create a \u201cTesla Network\u201d\ntaxi service that would make use of both Tesla-owned vehicles and customer\ncars that would be hired out when not in use.\n\nIn April 2022, however, at the inauguration of Tesla\u2019s new factory in Austin,\nTexas, Musk made headlines by announcing that the company would be working on\na dedicated Robotaxi vehicle that would be \u201cquite futuristic-looking\u201d.\n\n## A Variety of Robotaxis\n\nOnce we get to a world of \"robotaxis,\" it makes sense to continue evolving the\ninterior of the vehicle to suit customer needs such as adding face-to-face\nseating, big sliding doors providing easy access, 4-wheel steering, easier\ncleaning, etc.\n\nTesla could even create a variety of Robotaxis that help meet specific needs.\nFor example, Tesla could offer a vehicle that is better suited for resting,\nwhich could let you sleep on the way to your destination.\n\nAnother vehicle could be similar to a home office, offering multiple monitors\nand accessories that let you begin working as soon as you step inside the\nvehicle. Features such as these could bring huge quality of life improvements\nfor some; giving people an hour or more back in their day.\n\nThe variety of Robotaxis doesn't need to end there. There could be other\nvehicles that are made specifically for entertainment such as watching a\nmovie, or others that allow you to relax and converse with friends, much like\nyou'd expect in a limousine.\n\n## Lowest Cost Per Mile\n\nDuring Tesla's Q1 2022 financial results call, Musk stated that its robotaxi\nwould be focused on cost per mile, and would be highly optimized for autonomy\n- essentially confirming that it will not include a steering wheel.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite\nexciting, but it is fundamentally optimized to achieve the lowest fully\nconsidered cost per mile or km when counting everything\u201d, he said.\n\nDuring the call, Tesla acknowledged that its vehicles are largely inaccessible\nfor many people given their high cost and he sees the introduction of\nRobotaxis as a way of providing customers with \u201cby far the lowest cost-per-\nmile of transport that they\u2019ve ever experienced. The CEO believes that the\nvehicle is going to result in a cost per mile cheaper than a subsidized bus\nticket. If Tesla can achieve this, it could drastically change the entire\nautomotive industry and redefine car ownership. Is Tesla's future still in\nselling vehicles or providing a robotaxi service?\n\n## FSD Sensor Suite\n\nTesla hasn't revealed anything about the sensor suite that they're considering\nfor the robotaxi, but given all of their work in vision and progress in FSD,\nit's expected to be the same or similar to what is available today,\npotentially with additional cameras or faster processing.\n\nHowever, back in 2022, Musk gave this warning: \u201cWith respect to full self-\ndriving, of any technology development I\u2019ve been involved in, I\u2019ve never\nreally seen more false dawns or where it seems like we\u2019re going to break\nthrough, but we don\u2019t, as I\u2019ve seen in full self-driving,\u201d said Musk. \u201cAnd\nultimately what it comes down to is that to sell full self-driving, you\nactually have to solve real-world artificial intelligence, which nobody has\nsolved. The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes. And\nso actually, when you think about it, in order to solve driving, we have to\nsolve neural nets and cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with,\nor really exceeds humans. And I think we will achieve that this year.\u201d\n\nWith the Robotaxi unveil now approaching, it may not be long before we find\nout more details about Tesla's plan for the future and its truly autonomous\nvehicles.\n\n## Subscribe\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on the latest Tesla news,\nupcoming features and software updates.\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\n# Tesla Driver Walks Away Unharmed: A Testament to Vehicle Safety Amid\nDisaster\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nBy Kevin Armstrong\n\nIn the aftermath of a tragic crane collapse in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which\ntragically claimed the life of a construction worker and inflicted injuries\nupon others, the resilience and advanced safety features of a Tesla involved\nin the incident have been brought into focus.\n\nAs we offer our deepest sympathies to all affected by this unbelievable event,\nit's also important to recognize the role of advanced technology, particularly\nthe engineering of Tesla vehicles, in safeguarding human life under such\nextreme circumstances. This unfortunate incident serves as a poignant reminder\nof Tesla's unwavering commitment to safety, illustrating the capability of its\nvehicles to offer protection in the most unpredictable situations.\n\n## A Testament to Tesla's Safety\n\nMark Cerezin, behind the wheel of his Tesla, experienced an unimaginable\nscare. He described it to NBC Miami, \u201cI felt a compression. I looked up, and I\nsaw the blue structure coming down. I slammed on my brakes. It sheered off the\nfront of my Tesla, and all the airbags went off. I\u2019m very lucky to be alive.\u201d\nDespite the severity of the incident, Cerezin not only emerged completely\nunharmed, he was then seen helping someone else who appeared to have a head\ninjury. \u201cThere was a lady that was bleeding, and I took off my shirt and put\ncompression and helped her,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFrom this day forward, I\u2019m just happy to go home to my wife. I\u2019m happy to go\nhome to my family and my friends. I\u2019m just so grateful,\u201d he said. This\nremarkable escape underscores the exceptional structural integrity and safety\ndesign of Tesla vehicles, engineered to protect occupants even under the most\ndire circumstances.\n\n## Tesla's Safety Philosophy\n\nTesla's approach to vehicle safety is holistic, integrating active and passive\nsafety features. The brand's vehicles are renowned for their high ratings in\ncrash tests conducted by safety organizations worldwide. This results from\nmeticulous engineering, from the vehicle's frame design to cutting-edge\ndriver-assistance technologies.\n\nVice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy showed viewers the\ncornerstone principles behind Tesla's acclaimed safety features. Central to\nTesla's design philosophy is a robust passive safety system aimed at\nprotecting occupants and the vehicle's battery in the event of an accident.\nThis includes a progressive crash structure designed to absorb impact energy\nbefore it reaches the cabin, multiple load paths for effective energy\ndistribution regardless of collision type, and reinforced cabin safety through\nstrategic placement of door rings, glass, and a low-situated battery that also\nlowers the center of gravity to reduce rollover risks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs Tesla continues to innovate and refine its vehicles, the emphasis on safety\nremains paramount. The brand's commitment to meeting and exceeding safety\nstandards is reflected in the sophisticated safety technologies embedded in\neach model, from Autopilot to advanced airbag systems. Tesla's ongoing\ndedication to safety innovation advances its mission toward sustainable\ntransportation and ensures that drivers and passengers are afforded the\nhighest levels of protection possible.\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\n# Elon Musk at the Center of a Fierce AI Talent Competition between xAI, Tesla\nand Open AI\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\nBy Kevin Armstrong\n\nYouTube/NYT Events\n\nIn the rapidly advancing realm of artificial intelligence, Elon Musk is\nembroiled in a unique talent battle as Tesla and his latest enterprise, xAI,\nvie for the industry's leading minds. The shift of Tesla's computer vision\nchief, Ethan Knight, to xAI, illustrates a wider movement of key personnel\nbetween major tech players. This highlights the intense competition for AI's\nbrightest stars.\n\nWhile initially poised to join OpenAI, Knight's pivot to xAI adds a twist to\nthe narrative, with Musk downplaying the notion of poaching yet acknowledging\nthe fierce rivalry for top talent. To counter this, Tesla is introducing even\nmore compelling incentives to retain its pioneering engineers.\"\n\nIn response to hundreds of queries and comments on the situation, Musk\ndownplayed the impact of Knight's departure, emphasizing Tesla's robust team\nof over 200 engineers dedicated to AI and autonomy. Many comments on X suggest\nMusk is poaching from Tesla as a way to force the company to give him more\ncompensation and voting power. \u201cMusk responded: I (obviously) don\u2019t need (the)\nmoney personally, but am concerned about not having voting power that to\ninfluence Tesla to do the right thing.\u201d He currently has about 13% of the\ncompany but wants 25% control.\n\n## Tesla's Countermeasures\n\nMusk himself noted that Knight's decision was influenced by competitive offers\nfrom both xAI and OpenAI, hinting at the fierce recruitment landscape Tesla is\nnavigating. Musk's comments highlight a broader narrative, portraying Tesla's\nongoing acceleration in autonomy advancements despite the competitive\npressures. He acknowledges the AI talent war as unprecedented in intensity,\nunderlining the strategic importance of AI talent for the future of both Tesla\nand the broader tech industry.\n\n> Tesla is increasing comp (contingent on progress milestones) of our AI\n> engineering team\n>\n> \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 3, 2024\n\nMusk revealed Tesla's strategy to counter-recruitment efforts. The company is\nnot just matching the lucrative offers from rivals but also innovating its\ncompensation structure. By tying compensation increases to progress\nmilestones, Tesla aims to foster a culture of achievement and progress.\n\n## The Underlying Talent War Dynamics\n\nThe movement of high-profile engineers like Ethan Knight highlights a deeper\ncompetition for AI supremacy. With xAI successfully enticing several Tesla\nengineers, concerns arise over potential conflicts of interest and the\nimplications for Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. The talent war is\nnot just about compensation but also about the direction of AI development. It\nreflects a broader industry trend where the demand for AI expertise far\noutstrips supply, leading to aggressive recruitment strategies and significant\nshifts in talent.\n\nTesla's ability to continue its pace of innovation in AI and autonomy will\ndepend on its success in navigating this talent war, balancing the need to\nretain key personnel with the drive to push the boundaries of technology. As\nthe battle for AI talent rages on, Tesla has to balance stability and the\npursuit of groundbreaking advancements with its strategies and responses,\nshaping the future of autonomous driving.\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\n### Latest Tesla Update\n\nSee all the features included in Tesla's latest update, version 2024.8.9.\n\nView Release Notes\n\n### Tesla News\n\n#### Tesla Driver Walks Away Unharmed: A Testament to Vehicle Safety Amid\nDisaster\n\nIn the aftermath of a tragic crane collapse in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which\ntragically claimed the life of a construc...\n\n#### Elon Musk at the Center of a Fierce AI Talent Competition between xAI,\nTesla and Open AI\n\nIn the rapidly advancing realm of artificial intelligence, Elon Musk is\nembroiled in a unique talent battle as Tesla and...\n\n#### Beyond the Numbers: Tesla's Q1 Tale of Economic Turbulence and\nTechnological Promise\n\nIn case you missed it, Tesla\u2019s first-quarter numbers came in, and they have\nWall Street running for the hills, with cr...\n\n#### Tesla Plans to Increase Speed of New Autopark in Upcoming Update\n\nTesla is already planning to improve its latest Autopark feature so that it\u2019s\nmore usable in real-world situations.
