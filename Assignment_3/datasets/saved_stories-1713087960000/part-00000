Sign up\nfor it here.\n\n#### Day 1\n\nMY FIRST GLIMPSE of Royal Caribbean\u2019s Icon of the Seas, from the window of an\napproaching Miami cab, brings on a feeling of vertigo, nausea, amazement, and\ndistress. I shut my eyes in defense, as my brain tells my optic nerve to try\nagain.\n\nThe ship makes no sense, vertically or horizontally. It makes no sense on sea,\nor on land, or in outer space. It looks like a hodgepodge of domes and\nminarets, tubes and canopies, like Istanbul had it been designed by idiots.\nVibrant, oversignifying colors are stacked upon other such colors, decks\nperched over still more decks; the only comfort is a row of lifeboats ringing\nits perimeter. There is no imposed order, no cogent thought, and, for those\nwho do not harbor a totalitarian sense of gigantomania, no visual mercy. This\nis the biggest cruise ship ever built, and I have been tasked with witnessing\nits inaugural voyage.\n\n## Explore the May 2024 Issue\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nView More\n\n\u201cAuthor embarks on their first cruise-ship voyage\u201d has been a staple of\nAmerican essay writing for almost three decades, beginning with David Foster\nWallace\u2019s \u201cA Supposedly Fun Thing I\u2019ll Never Do Again,\u201d which was first\npublished in 1996 under the title \u201cShipping Out.\u201d Since then, many admirable\nwriters have widened and diversified the genre. Usually the essayist\ncommissioned to take to the sea is in their first or second flush of youth and\nis ready to sharpen their wit against the hull of the offending vessel. I am\n51, old and tired, having seen much of the world as a former travel\njournalist, and mostly what I do in both life and prose is shrug while\nmuttering to my imaginary dachshund, \u201cThis too shall pass.\u201d But the Icon of\nthe Seas will not countenance a shrug. The Icon of the Seas is the Linda Loman\nof cruise ships, exclaiming that attention must be paid. And here I am in late\nJanuary with my one piece of luggage and useless gray winter jacket and\npassport, zipping through the Port of Miami en route to the gangway that will\nseparate me from the bulk of North America for more than seven days, ready to\npay it in full.\n\nThe aforementioned gangway opens up directly onto a thriving mall (I will soon\nlearn it is imperiously called the \u201cRoyal Promenade\u201d), presently filled with\nyapping passengers beneath a ceiling studded with balloons ready to drop. Crew\nmembers from every part of the global South, as well as a few Balkans, are\nshepherding us along while pressing flutes of champagne into our hands. By a\nhumming Starbucks, I drink as many of these as I can and prepare to find my\ncabin. I show my blue Suite Sky SeaPass Card (more on this later, much more)\nto a smiling woman from the Philippines, and she tells me to go \u201caft.\u201d Which\nis where, now? As someone who has rarely sailed on a vessel grander than the\nStaten Island Ferry, I am confused. It turns out that the aft is the stern of\nthe ship, or, for those of us who don\u2019t know what a stern or an aft are, its\nass. The nose of the ship, responsible for separating the waves before it, is\nalso called a bow, and is marked for passengers as the FWD, or forward. The\npart of the contemporary sailing vessel where the malls are clustered is\ncalled the midship. I trust that you have enjoyed this nautical lesson.\n\nI ascend via elevator to my suite on Deck 11. This is where I encounter my\nfirst terrible surprise. My suite windows and balcony do not face the ocean.\nInstead, they look out onto another shopping mall. This mall is the one that\u2019s\ncalled Central Park, perhaps in homage to the Olmsted-designed bit of greenery\nin the middle of my hometown. Although on land I would be delighted to own a\nsuite with Central Park views, here I am deeply depressed. To sail on a ship\nand not wake up to a vast blue carpet of ocean? Unthinkable.\n\nI naively thought that my meatball T-shirt would be suitable for conversation-\nstarting.\n\nAllow me a brief preamble here. The story you are reading was commissioned at\na moment when most staterooms on the Icon were sold out. In fact, so\nenthralled by the prospect of this voyage were hard-core mariners that the\nship\u2019s entire inventory of guest rooms (the Icon can accommodate up to 7,600\npassengers, but its inaugural journey was reduced to 5,000 or so for a less\ncrowded experience) was almost immediately sold out. Hence, this publication\nwas faced with the shocking prospect of paying nearly $19,000 to procure for\nthis solitary passenger an entire suite\u2014not including drinking expenses\u2014all\nfor the privilege of bringing you this article. But the suite in question\ndoesn\u2019t even have a view of the ocean! I sit down hard on my soft bed.\nNineteen thousand dollars for this.\n\nThe author tries to make friends at the world\u2019s largest swim-up bar at sea.\n(Gary Shteyngart)\n\nThe viewless suite does have its pluses. In addition to all the Malin+Goetz\nproducts in my dual bathrooms, I am granted use of a dedicated Suite Deck\nlounge; access to Coastal Kitchen, a superior restaurant for Suites\npassengers; complimentary VOOM^SM Surf & Stream (\u201cthe fastest Internet at\nSea\u201d) \u201cfor one device per person for the whole cruise duration\u201d; a pair of\nbathrobes (one of which comes prestained with what looks like a large\nexpectoration by the greenest lizard on Earth); and use of the Grove Suite\nSun, an area on Decks 18 and 19 with food and deck chairs reserved exclusively\nfor Suite passengers. I also get reserved seating for a performance of The\nWizard of Oz, an ice-skating tribute to the periodic table, and similar\nprovocations. The very color of my Suite Sky SeaPass Card, an oceanic blue as\nopposed to the cloying royal purple of the standard non-Suite passenger, will\nsoon provoke envy and admiration. But as high as my status may be, there are\nthose on board who have much higher status still, and I will soon learn to bow\nbefore them.\n\nIn preparation for sailing, I have \u201cpriced in,\u201d as they say on Wall Street,\nthe possibility that I may come from a somewhat different monde than many of\nthe other cruisers. Without falling into stereotypes or preconceptions, I\nprepare myself for a friendly outspokenness on the part of my fellow seafarers\nthat may not comply with modern DEI standards. I believe in meeting people\nhalfway, and so the day before flying down to Miami, I visited what remains of\nLittle Italy to purchase a popular T-shirt that reads DADDY\u2019S LITTLE MEATBALL\nacross the breast in the colors of the Italian flag. My wife recommended that\nI bring one of my many T-shirts featuring Snoopy and the Peanuts gang, as all\nAmericans love the beagle and his friends. But I naively thought that my\nmeatball T-shirt would be more suitable for conversation-starting. \u201cOh, and\nwho is your \u2018daddy\u2019?\u201d some might ask upon seeing it. \u201cAnd how long have you\nbeen his \u2018little meatball\u2019?\u201d And so on.\n\nI put on my meatball T-shirt and head for one of the dining rooms to get a\nlate lunch. In the elevator, I stick out my chest for all to read the funny\nlegend upon it, but soon I realize that despite its burnished tricolor\nletters, no one takes note. More to the point, no one takes note of me.\nDespite my attempts at bridge building, the very sight of me (small, ethnic,\nwithout a cap bearing the name of a football team) elicits no reaction from\nother passengers. Most often, they will small-talk over me as if I don\u2019t\nexist. This brings to mind the travails of David Foster Wallace, who felt so\nostracized by his fellow passengers that he retreated to his cabin for much of\nhis voyage. And Wallace was raised primarily in the Midwest and was a much\nlarger, more American-looking meatball than I am. If he couldn\u2019t talk to these\npeople, how will I? What if I leave this ship without making any friends at\nall, despite my T-shirt? I am a social creature, and the prospect of seven\ndays alone and apart is saddening. Wallace\u2019s stateroom, at least, had a view\nof the ocean, a kind of cheap eternity.\n\nWorse awaits me in the dining room. This is a large, multichandeliered room\nwhere I attended my safety training (I was shown how to put on a flotation\nvest; it is a very simple procedure). But the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 politely refuses me\nentry in an English that seems to verge on another language. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, this\nis only for pendejos,\u201d he seems to be saying. I push back politely and he\nrepeats himself. Pendejos ? Piranhas? There\u2019s some kind of P-word to which I\nam not attuned. Meanwhile elderly passengers stream right past, powered by\ntheir limbs, walkers, and electric wheelchairs. \u201cIt is only pendejo dining\ntoday, sir.\u201d \u201cBut I have a suite!\u201d I say, already starting to catch on to the\nship\u2019s class system. He examines my card again. \u201cBut you are not a pendejo,\u201d\nhe confirms. I am wearing a DADDY\u2019S LITTLE MEATBALL T-shirt, I want to say to\nhim. I am the essence of pendejo.\n\nEventually, I give up and head to the plebeian buffet on Deck 15, which has an\naquatic-styled name I have now forgotten. Before gaining entry to this endless\ncornucopia of reheated food, one passes a washing station of many sinks and\nsoap dispensers, and perhaps the most intriguing character on the entire ship.\nHe is Mr. Washy Washy\u2014or, according to his name tag, Nielbert of the\nPhilippines\u2014and he is dressed as a taco (on other occasions, I\u2019ll see him\ndressed as a burger). Mr. Washy Washy performs an eponymous song in spirited,\nindeed flamboyant English: \u201cWashy, washy, wash your hands, WASHY WASHY!\u201d The\ndangers of norovirus and COVID on a cruise ship this size (a giant fellow ship\nwas stricken with the former right after my voyage) makes Mr. Washy Washy an\nessential member of the crew. The problem lies with the food at the end of\nWashy\u2019s rainbow. The buffet is groaning with what sounds like sophisticated\ndishes\u2014marinated octopus, boiled egg with anchovy, chorizo, lobster claws\u2014but\nevery animal tastes tragically the same, as if there was only one creature\navailable at the market, a \u201ccruisipus\u201d bred specifically for Royal Caribbean\ndining. The \u201cvegetables\u201d are no better. I pick up a tomato slice and look\nright through it. It tastes like cellophane. I sit alone, apart from the\ncouples and parents with gaggles of children, as \u201cWe Are Family\u201d echoes across\nthe buffet space.\n\nI may have failed to mention that all this time, the Icon of the Seas has not\nleft port. As the fiery mango of the subtropical setting sun makes Miami\u2019s\ncondo skyline even more apocalyptic, the ship shoves off beneath a perfunctory\ndisplay of fireworks. After the sun sets, in the far, dark distance, another\ncircus-lit cruise ship ruptures the waves before us. We glance at it with\npity, because it is by definition a smaller ship than our own. I am on Deck\n15, outside the buffet and overlooking a bunch of pools (the Icon has seven of\nthem), drinking a frilly drink that I got from one of the bars (the Icon has\n15 of them), still too shy to speak to anyone, despite Sister Sledge\u2019s\nassertion that all on the ship are somehow related.\n\nKim Brooks: On failing the family vacation\n\nThe ship\u2019s passage away from Ron DeSantis\u2019s Florida provides no frisson, no\nsense of developing \u201csea legs,\u201d as the ship is too large to register the\npresence of waves unless a mighty wind adds significant chop. It is time for\nme to register the presence of the 5,000 passengers around me, even if they\nrefuse to register mine. My fellow travelers have prepared for this trip with\npersonally decorated T-shirts celebrating the importance of this voyage. The\nsimplest ones say ICON INAUGURAL \u201924 on the back and the family name on the\nfront. Others attest to an over-the-top love of cruise ships: WARNING! MAY\nSTART TALKING ABOUT CRUISING. Still others are artisanally designed and\ncelebrate lifetimes spent married while cruising (on ships, of course). A\ncouple possibly in their 90s are wearing shirts whose backs feature a drawing\nof a cruise liner, two flamingos with ostensibly male and female\ncharacteristics, and the legend \u201cHUSBAND AND WIFE Cruising Partners FOR LIFE\nWE MAY NOT HAVE IT All Together BUT TOGETHER WE HAVE IT ALL.\u201d (The words not\nin all caps have been written in cursive.) A real journalist or a more\nintrepid conversationalist would have gone up to the couple and asked them to\nexplain the longevity of their marriage vis-\u00e0-vis their love of cruising. But\ninstead I head to my mall suite, take off my meatball T-shirt, and allow the\nfirst tears of the cruise to roll down my cheeks slowly enough that I briefly\nfall asleep amid the moisture and salt.\n\nThe aquatic rides remind the author of his latest colonoscopy. (Gary\nShteyngart)\n\n#### Day 2\n\nI WAKE UP with a hangover. Oh God. Right. I cannot believe all of that\nhappened last night. A name floats into my cobwebbed, nauseated brain: \u201cAyn\nRand.\u201d Jesus Christ.\n\nI breakfast alone at the Coastal Kitchen. The coffee tastes fine and the eggs\ncame out of a bird. The ship rolls slightly this morning; I can feel it in my\nthighs and my schlong, the parts of me that are most receptive to danger.\n\nI had a dangerous conversation last night. After the sun set and we were at\nleast 50 miles from shore (most modern cruise ships sail at about 23 miles an\nhour), I lay in bed softly hiccupping, my arms stretched out exactly like\nJesus on the cross, the sound of the distant waves missing from my mall-facing\nsuite, replaced by the hum of air-conditioning and children shouting in\nSpanish through the vents of my two bathrooms. I decided this passivity was\nunacceptable. As an immigrant, I feel duty-bound to complete the tasks I am\npaid for, which means reaching out and trying to understand my fellow\ncruisers. So I put on a normal James Perse T-shirt and headed for one of the\nbars on the Royal Promenade\u2014the Schooner Bar, it was called, if memory serves\ncorrectly.\n\n\u201cAyn Rand, she came here with nothing.\u201d\n\nI sat at the bar for a martini and two Negronis. An old man with thick, hairy\nforearms drank next to me, very silent and Hemingwaylike, while a dreadlocked\npiano player tinkled out a series of excellent Elton John covers. To my right,\na young white couple\u2014he in floral shorts, she in a light, summery miniskirt\nwith a fearsome diamond ring, neither of them in football regalia\u2014chatted with\nan elderly couple. Do it, I commanded myself. Open your mouth. Speak! Speak\nwithout being spoken to. Initiate. A sentence fragment caught my ear from the\nyoung woman, \u201cCherry Hill.\u201d This is a suburb of Philadelphia in New Jersey,\nand I had once been there for a reading at a synagogue. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said\ngently to her. \u201cDid you just mention Cherry Hill? It\u2019s a lovely place.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, the couple now lived in Fort Lauderdale (the number of\nFloridians on the cruise surprised me, given that Southern Florida is itself a\nkind of cruise ship, albeit one slowly sinking), but soon they were talking\nwith me exclusively\u2014the man potbellied, with a chin like a hard-boiled egg;\nthe woman as svelte as if she were one of the many Ukrainian members of the\ncrew\u2014the elderly couple next to them forgotten. This felt as groundbreaking as\nthe first time I dared to address an American in his native tongue, as a child\non a bus in Queens (\u201cOn my foot you are standing, Mister\u201d).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk politics,\u201d the man said. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to eighty-\nsix Biden and put Michelle in.\u201d\n\nI considered the contradictions of his opening conversational gambit, but\ndecided to play along. \u201cPeople like Michelle,\u201d I said, testing the waters. The\nhusband sneered, but the wife charitably put forward that the former first\nlady was \u201cmore personable\u201d than Joe Biden. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna eighty-six Biden,\u201d\nthe husband repeated. \u201cHe can\u2019t put a sentence together.\u201d\n\nAfter I mentioned that I was a writer\u2014though I presented myself as a writer of\nteleplays instead of novels and articles such as this one\u2014the husband told me\nhis favorite writer was Ayn Rand. \u201cAyn Rand, she came here with nothing,\u201d the\nhusband said. \u201cI work with a lot of Cubans, so ...\u201d I wondered if I should\nmention what I usually do to ingratiate myself with Republicans or\nlibertarians: the fact that my finances improved after pass-through\ncorporations were taxed differently under Donald Trump. Instead, I ordered\nanother drink and the couple did the same, and I told him that Rand and I were\nborn in the same city, St. Petersburg/Leningrad, and that my family also came\nhere with nothing. Now the bonding and drinking began in earnest, and several\nmore rounds appeared. Until it all fell apart.\n\nRead: Gary Shteyngart on watching Russian television for five days straight\n\nMy new friend, whom I will refer to as Ayn, called out to a buddy of his\nacross the bar, and suddenly a young couple, both covered in tattoos, appeared\nnext to us. \u201cHe fucking punked me,\u201d Ayn\u2019s frat-boy-like friend called out as\nhe put his arm around Ayn, while his sizable partner sizzled up to Mrs. Rand.\nBoth of them had a look I have never seen on land\u2014their eyes projecting\nabsence and enmity in equal measure. In the \u201990s, I drank with Russian\nsoldiers fresh from Chechnya and wandered the streets of wartime Zagreb, but I\nhave never seen such undisguised hostility toward both me and perhaps the\nuniverse at large. I was briefly introduced to this psychopathic pair, but\nneither of them wanted to have anything to do with me, and the tattooed woman\nwould not even reveal her Christian name to me (she pretended to have the same\nfirst name as Mrs. Rand). To impress his tattooed friends, Ayn made fun of the\nfact that as a television writer, I\u2019d worked on the series Succession (which,\nit would turn out, practically nobody on the ship had watched), instead of the\nfar more palatable, in his eyes, zombie drama of last year. And then my new\nfriends drifted away from me into an angry private conversation\u2014\u201cHe punked\nme!\u201d\u2014as I ordered another drink for myself, scared of the dead-eyed arrivals\nwhose gaze never registered in the dim wattage of the Schooner Bar, whose\nterrifying voices and hollow laughs grated like unoiled gears against the\ncrooning of \u201cGoodbye Yellow Brick Road.\u201d\n\nBut today is a new day for me and my hangover. After breakfast, I explore the\nship\u2019s so-called neighborhoods. There\u2019s the AquaDome, where one can find a\nfood hall and an acrobatic sound-and-light aquatic show. Central Park has a\npremium steak house, a sushi joint, and a used Rolex that can be bought for\n$8,000 on land here proudly offered at $17,000. There\u2019s the aforementioned\nRoyal Promenade, where I had drunk with the Rands, and where a pair of dueling\npianos duel well into the night. There\u2019s Surfside, a kids\u2019 neighborhood full\nof sugary garbage, which looks out onto the frothy trail that the behemoth\nleaves behind itself. Thrill Island refers to the collection of tubes that\nclutter the ass of the ship and offer passengers six waterslides and a surfing\nsimulation. There\u2019s the Hideaway, an adult zone that plays music from a vomit-\nslathered, Brit-filled Alicante nightclub circa 1996 and proves a big favorite\nwith groups of young Latin American customers. And, most hurtfully, there\u2019s\nthe Suite Neighborhood.\n\nLeft: The Icon leaves a giant wake in its path. Right: Docked at Royal\nCaribbean\u2019s own Bahamian island, known as the Perfect Day at CocoCay. (Gary\nShteyngart)\n\nI say hurtfully because as a Suite passenger I should be here, though my\nparticular suite is far from the others. Whereas I am stuck amid the riffraff\nof Deck 11, this section is on the highborn Decks 16 and 17, and in passing, I\npeek into the spacious, tall-ceilinged staterooms from the hallway, dazzled by\nthe glint of the waves and sun. For $75,000, one multifloor suite even comes\nwith its own slide between floors, so that a family may enjoy this particular\nterror in private. There is a quiet splendor to the Suite Neighborhood. I see\nfewer stickers and signs and drawings than in my own neighborhood\u2014for example,\nMIKE AND DIANA PROUDLY SERVED U.S. MARINE CORPS RETIRED. No one here needs to\nannounce their branch of service or rank; they are simply Suites, and this is\nwhere they belong. Once again, despite my hard work and perseverance, I have\nbeen disallowed from the true American elite. Once again, I am \u201cNot our class,\ndear.\u201d I am reminded of watching The Love Boat on my grandmother\u2019s Zenith,\nwhich either was given to her or we found in the trash (I get our many\nmalfunctioning Zeniths confused) and whose tube got so hot, I would put little\nchunks of government cheese on a thin tissue atop it to give our welfare treat\na pleasant, Reagan-era gooeyness. I could not understand English well enough\nthen to catch the nuances of that seafaring program, but I knew that there\nwere differences in the status of the passengers, and that sometimes those\ndifferences made them sad. Still, this ship, this plenty\u2014every few steps,\nthere are complimentary nachos or milkshakes or gyros on offer\u2014was the fatty\nfuel of my childhood dreams. If only I had remained a child.\n\nI walk around the outdoor decks looking for company. There is a middle-aged\nAfrican American couple who always seem to be asleep in each other\u2019s arms,\nprobably exhausted from the late capitalism they regularly encounter on land.\nThere is far more diversity on this ship than I expected. Many couples are a\ntestament to Loving v. Virginia, and there is a large group of folks whose\nT-shirts read MELANIN AT SEA / IT\u2019S THE MELANIN FOR ME. I smile when I see\nthem, but then some young kids from the group makes Mr. Washy Washy do a\ncruel, caricatured \u201cBurger Dance\u201d (today he is in his burger getup), and I\nthink, Well, so much for intersectionality.\n\nAt the infinity pool on Deck 17, I spot some elderly women who could be ethnic\nand from my part of the world, and so I jump in. I am proved correct! Many of\nthem seem to be originally from Queens (\u201cCorona was still great when it was\nall Italian\u201d), though they are now spread across the tristate area. We bond\nover the way \u201cRon-kon-koma\u201d sounds when announced in Penn Station.\n\n\u201cEveryone is here for a different reason,\u201d one of them tells me. She and her\nex-husband last sailed together four years ago to prove to themselves that\ntheir marriage was truly over. Her 15-year-old son lost his virginity to \u201can\nIrish young lady\u201d while their ship was moored in Ravenna, Italy. The gaggle of\nold-timers competes to tell me their favorite cruising stories and tips. \u201cA\nguy proposed in Central Park a couple of years ago\u201d\u2014many Royal Caribbean ships\napparently have this ridiculous communal area\u2014\u201cand she ran away screaming!\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re diamond-class, you get four drinks for free.\u201d \u201cA different kind of\npassenger sails out of Bayonne.\u201d (This, perhaps, is racially coded.)\n\u201cSometimes, if you tip the bartender $5, your next drink will be free.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s here for a different reason,\u201d the woman whose marriage ended on a\ncruise tells me again. \u201cSome people are here for bad reasons\u2014the drinkers and\nthe gamblers. Some people are here for medical reasons.\u201d I have seen more than\na few oxygen tanks and at least one woman clearly undergoing very serious\nchemo. Some T-shirts celebrate good news about a cancer diagnosis. This might\nbe someone\u2019s last cruise or week on Earth. For these women, who have spent\nmonths, if not years, at sea, cruising is a ritual as well as a life cycle:\nfirst love, last love, marriage, divorce, death.\n\nRead: The last place on Earth any tourist should go\n\nI have talked with these women for so long, tonight I promise myself that\nafter a sad solitary dinner I will not try to seek out company at the bars in\nthe mall or the adult-themed Hideaway. I have enough material to fulfill my\nduties to this publication. As I approach my orphaned suite, I run into the\naggro young people who stole Mr. and Mrs. Rand away from me the night before.\nThe tattooed apparitions pass me without a glance. She is singing something\nviolent about \u201cStuttering Stanley\u201d (a character in a popular horror movie, as\nI discover with my complimentary VOOM^SM Surf & Stream Internet at Sea) and\nhe\u2019s loudly shouting about \u201call the money I\u2019ve lost,\u201d presumably at the casino\nin the bowels of the ship.\n\nSo these bent psychos out of a Cormac McCarthy novel are angrily inhabiting my\ndeck. As I mewl myself to sleep, I envision a limited series for HBO or some\nother streamer, a kind of low-rent White Lotus, where several aggressive\ncouples conspire to throw a shy intellectual interloper overboard. I type the\nscenario into my phone. As I fall asleep, I think of what the woman who\nrecently divorced her husband and whose son became a man through the good\noffices of the Irish Republic told me while I was hoisting myself out of the\ninfinity pool. \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m an explorer. I\u2019m here because I\u2019m trying\nsomething new.\u201d What if I allowed myself to believe in her fantasy?\n\nLeft: Seafood pizza. Right: The author\u2019s special T-shirt. (Gary Shteyngart)\n\n#### Day 3\n\n\u201cYOU REALLY STARTED AT THE TOP,\u201d they tell me. I\u2019m at the Coastal Kitchen for\nmy eggs and corned-beef hash, and the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 has slotted me in between two\ncouples. Fueled by coffee or perhaps intrigued by my relative youth, they\nstrike up a conversation with me. As always, people are shocked that this is\nmy first cruise. They contrast the Icon favorably with all the preceding\nliners in the Royal Caribbean fleet, usually commenting on the efficiency of\nthe elevators that hurl us from deck to deck (as in many large corporate\nbuildings, the elevators ask you to choose a floor and then direct you to one\nof many lifts). The couple to my right, from Palo Alto\u2014he refers to his \u201cporn\nmustache\u201d and calls his wife \u201cmy cougar\u201d because she is two years older\u2014tell\nme they are \u201cPandemic Pinnacles.\u201d\n\nThis is the day that my eyes will be opened. Pinnacles, it is explained to me\nover translucent cantaloupe, have sailed with Royal Caribbean for 700 ungodly\nnights. Pandemic Pinnacles took advantage of the two-for-one accrual rate of\nPinnacle points during the pandemic, when sailing on a cruise ship was even\nmore ill-advised, to catapult themselves into Pinnacle status.\n\nBecause of the importance of the inaugural voyage of the world\u2019s largest\ncruise liner, more than 200 Pinnacles are on this ship, a startling number, it\nseems. Mrs. Palo Alto takes out a golden badge that I have seen affixed over\nmany a breast, which reads CROWN AND ANCHOR SOCIETY along with her name. This\nis the coveted badge of the Pinnacle. \u201cYou should hear all the whining in\nGuest Services,\u201d her husband tells me. Apparently, the Pinnacles who are not\nalso Suites like us are all trying to use their status to get into Coastal\nKitchen, our elite restaurant. Even a Pinnacle needs to be a Suite to access\nthis level of corned-beef hash.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just baby Pinnacles,\u201d Mrs. Palo Alto tells me, describing a kind of\ninternal class struggle among the Pinnacle elite for ever higher status.\n\nAnd now I understand what the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 was saying to me on the first day of\nmy cruise. He wasn\u2019t saying \u201cpendejo.\u201d He was saying \u201cPinnacle.\u201d The dining\nroom was for Pinnacles only, all those older people rolling in like the tide\non their motorized scooters.\n\nAnd now I understand something else: This whole thing is a cult. And like most\ncults, it can\u2019t help but mirror the endless American fight for status. Like\nKeith Raniere\u2019s NXIVM, where different-colored sashes were given out to\nconnote rank among Raniere\u2019s branded acolytes, this is an endless competition\namong Pinnacles, Suites, Diamond-Plusers, and facing-the-mall, no-balcony\npurple SeaPass Card peasants, not to mention the many distinctions within each\ncategory. The more you cruise, the higher your status. No wonder a section of\nthe Royal Promenade is devoted to getting passengers to book their next cruise\nduring the one they should be enjoying now. No wonder desperate Royal\nCaribbean offers (\u201cFINAL HOURS\u201d) crowded my email account weeks before I set\nsail. No wonder the ship\u2019s jewelry store, the Royal Bling, is selling a\n$100,000 golden chalice that will entitle its owner to drink free on Royal\nCaribbean cruises for life. (One passenger was already gaming out whether her\n28-year-old son was young enough to \u201cjust about earn out\u201d on the chalice or if\nthat ship had sailed.) No wonder this ship was sold out months before\ndeparture, and we had to pay $19,000 for a horrid suite away from the Suite\nNeighborhood. No wonder the most mythical hero of Royal Caribbean lore is\nsomeone named Super Mario, who has cruised so often, he now has his own\nworking desk on many ships. This whole experience is part cult, part nautical\npyramid scheme.\n\nFrom the June 2014 issue: Ship of wonks\n\n\u201cThe toilets are amazing,\u201d the Palo Altos are telling me. \u201cOne flush and\nyou\u2019re done.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t understand how energy-efficient these ships are,\u201d\nthe husband of the other couple is telling me. \u201cThey got the LNG\u201d\u2014liquefied\nnatural gas, which is supposed to make the Icon a boon to the environment (a\nconcept widely disputed and sometimes ridiculed by environmentalists).\n\nBut I\u2019m thinking along a different line of attack as I spear my last pallid\nslice of melon. For my streaming limited series, a Pinnacle would have to get\nkilled by either an outright peasant or a Suite without an ocean view. I tell\nmy breakfast companions my idea.\n\n\u201cOh, for sure a Pinnacle would have to be killed,\u201d Mr. Palo Alto, the Pandemic\nPinnacle, says, touching his porn mustache thoughtfully as his wife nods.\n\n\u201cTHAT\u2019S RIGHT, IT\u2019S your time, buddy!\u201d Hubert, my fun-loving Panamanian cabin\nattendant, shouts as I step out of my suite in a robe. \u201cTake it easy, buddy!\u201d\n\nI have come up with a new dressing strategy. Instead of trying to impress with\nmy choice of T-shirts, I have decided to start wearing a robe, as one does at\na resort property on land, with a proper spa and hammam. The response among my\nfellow cruisers has been ecstatic. \u201cLook at you in the robe!\u201d Mr. Rand cries\nout as we pass each other by the Thrill Island aqua park. \u201cYou\u2019re living the\ncruise life! You know, you really drank me under the table that night.\u201d I\nlaugh as we part ways, but my soul cries out, Please spend more time with me,\nMr. and Mrs. Rand; I so need the company.\n\nIn my white robe, I am a stately presence, a refugee from a better limited\nseries, a one-man crossover episode. (Only Suites are granted these robes to\nbegin with.) Today, I will try many of the activities these ships have on\noffer to provide their clientele with a sense of never-ceasing motion. Because\nI am already at Thrill Island, I decide to climb the staircase to what looks\nlike a mast on an old-fashioned ship (terrified, because I am afraid of\nheights) to try a ride called \u201cStorm Chasers,\u201d which is part of the \u201cCategory\n6\u201d water park, named in honor of one of the storms that may someday do away\nwith the Port of Miami entirely. Storm Chasers consists of falling from the\n\u201cmast\u201d down a long, twisting neon tube filled with water, like being the\ncamera inside your own colonoscopy, as you hold on to the handles of a mat,\nhoping not to die. The tube then flops you down headfirst into a trough of\nwater, a Royal Caribbean baptism. It both knocks my breath out and makes me\nsad.\n\nIn keeping with the aquatic theme, I attend a show at the AquaDome. To the\nsound of \u201cLive and Let Die,\u201d a man in a harness gyrates to and fro in the\nsultry air. I saw something very similar in the back rooms of the famed\nBerghain club in early-aughts Berlin. Soon another harnessed man is gyrating\nnext to the first. Ja, I think to myself, I know how this ends. Now will come\nthe fisting, nat\u00fcrlich. But the show soon devolves into the usual Marvel-film-\ngrade nonsense, with too much light and sound signifying nichts. If any\nfisting is happening, it is probably in the Suite Neighborhood, inside a cabin\nmarked with an upside-down pineapple, which I understand means a couple are\nready to swing, and I will see none of it.\n\nI go to the ice show, which is a kind of homage\u2014if that\u2019s possible\u2014to the\nperiodic table, done with the style and pomp and masterful precision that\nwould please the likes of Kim Jong Un, if only he could afford Royal Caribbean\ntalent. At one point, the dancers skate to the theme song of Succession. \u201cSee\nthat!\u201d I want to say to my fellow Suites\u2014at \u201ccultural\u201d events, we have a\nspecial section reserved for us away from the commoners\u2014\u201cSuccession! It\u2019s even\nbetter than the zombie show! Open your minds!\u201d\n\nFinally, I visit a comedy revue in an enormous and too brightly lit version of\nan \u201cintimate,\u201d per Royal Caribbean literature, \u201cManhattan comedy club.\u201d Many\nof the jokes are about the cruising life. \u201cI\u2019ve lived on ships for 20 years,\u201d\none of the middle-aged comedians says. \u201cI can only see so many Filipino\nhomosexuals dressed as a taco.\u201d He pauses while the audience laughs. \u201cI am so\nfired tonight,\u201d he says. He segues into a Trump impression and then Biden\nfalling asleep at the microphone, which gets the most laughs. \u201cAnyone here\nfrom Fort Leonard Wood?\u201d another comedian asks. Half the crowd seems to cheer.\nAs I fall asleep that night, I realize another connection I have failed to\nmake, and one that may explain some of the diversity on this vessel\u2014many of\nits passengers have served in the military.\n\nAs a coddled passenger with a suite, I feel like I am starting to understand\nwhat it means to have a rank and be constantly reminded of it. There are many\nespresso makers, I think as I look across the expanse of my officer-grade\nquarters before closing my eyes, but this one is mine.\n\nTwo enormous cruise ships at the Perfect Day at CocoCay, a private island with\nmany of the same amenities as the ship itself (Gary Shteyngart)\n\n#### Day 4\n\nA shocking sight greets me beyond the pools of Deck 17 as I saunter over to\nthe Coastal Kitchen for my morning intake of slightly sour Americanos. A tiny\ncity beneath a series of perfectly pressed green mountains. Land! We have\ndocked for a brief respite in Basseterre, the capital of St. Kitts and Nevis.\nI wolf down my egg scramble to be one of the first passengers off the ship.\nOnce past the gangway, I barely refrain from kissing the ground. I rush into\nthe sights and sounds of this scruffy island city, sampling incredible conch\ncurry and buckets of non-Starbucks coffee. How wonderful it is to be where God\nintended humans to be: on land. After all, I am neither a fish nor a mall rat.\nThis is my natural environment. Basseterre may not be Havana, but there are\nsigns of human ingenuity and desire everywhere you look. The Black Table Grill\nHas been Relocated to Soho Village, Market Street, Directly Behind of, Gary\u2019s\nFruits and Flower Shop. Signed. THE PORK MAN reads a sign stuck to a wall.\nNow, that is how you write a sign. A real sign, not the come-ons for\noverpriced Rolexes that blink across the screens of the Royal Promenade.\n\n\u201cHey, tie your shoestring!\u201d a pair of laughing ladies shout to me across the\nstreet.\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d I shout back. Shoestring! \u201cThank you very much.\u201d\n\nA man in Independence Square Park comes by and asks if I want to play with his\nmonkey. I haven\u2019t heard that pickup line since the Penn Station of the 1980s.\nBut then he pulls a real monkey out of a bag. The monkey is wearing a diaper\nand looks insane. Wonderful, I think, just wonderful! There is so much life\nhere. I email my editor asking if I can remain on St. Kitts and allow the Icon\nto sail off into the horizon without me. I have even priced a flight home at\nless than $300, and I have enough material from the first four days on the\ncruise to write the entire story. \u201cIt would be funny ...\u201d my editor replies.\n\u201cNow get on the boat.\u201d\n\nAs I slink back to the ship after my brief jailbreak, the locals stand under\numbrellas to gaze at and photograph the boat that towers over their small\ncapital city. The limousines of the prime minister and his lackeys are parked\nbeside the gangway. St. Kitts, I\u2019ve been told, is one of the few islands that\nwould allow a ship of this size to dock.\n\n\u201cWe hear about all the waterslides,\u201d a sweet young server in one of the caf\u00e9s\ntold me. \u201cWe wish we could go on the ship, but we have to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to stay on your island,\u201d I replied. \u201cI love it here.\u201d\n\nBut she didn\u2019t understand how I could possibly mean that.\n\n#### Day 5\n\n\u201cWASHY, WASHY, so you don\u2019t get stinky, stinky!\u201d kids are singing outside the\nAquaDome, while their adult minders look on in disapproval, perhaps worried\nthat Mr. Washy Washy is grooming them into a life of gayness. I heard a\nsouthern couple skip the buffet entirely out of fear of Mr. Washy Washy.\n\nMeanwhile, I have found a new watering hole for myself, the Swim & Tonic, the\nbiggest swim-up bar on any cruise ship in the world. Drinking next to full-\nsize, nearly naked Americans takes away one\u2019s own self-consciousness. The men\nhave curvaceous mom bodies. The women are equally un-shy about their sprawling\nphysiques.\n\nToday I\u2019ve befriended a bald man with many children who tells me that all of\nthe little trinkets that Royal Caribbean has left us in our staterooms and\nsuites are worth a fortune on eBay. \u201cEighty dollars for the water bottle, 60\nfor the lanyard,\u201d the man says. \u201cThis is a cult.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d I say. There is, however, a clientele for whom this cruise\nmakes perfect sense. For a large middle-class family (he works in \u201csupply\nchains\u201d), seven days in a lower-tier cabin\u2014which starts at $1,800 a\nperson\u2014allow the parents to drop off their children in Surfside, where I\nimagine many young Filipina crew members will take care of them, while the\nparents are free to get drunk at a swim-up bar and maybe even get intimate in\ntheir cabin. Cruise ships have become, for a certain kind of hardworking\nfamily, a form of subsidized child care.\n\nThere is another man I would like to befriend at the Swim & Tonic, a tall,\nbald fellow who is perpetually inebriated and who wears a necklace studded\nwith little rubber duckies in sunglasses, which, I am told, is a sort of\nsecret handshake for cruise aficionados. Tomorrow, I will spend more time with\nhim, but first the ship docks at St. Thomas, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nCharlotte Amalie, the capital, is more charming in name than in presence, but\nI still all but jump off the ship to score a juicy oxtail and plantains at the\nwell-known Petite Pump Room, overlooking the harbor. From one of the highest\npoints in the small city, the Icon of the Seas appears bigger than the\nsurrounding hills.\n\nI overhear the male member of a young couple whisper, \u201cThere goes that freak\u201d\nas I saunter by in my robe.\n\nI usually tan very evenly, but something about the discombobulation of life at\nsea makes me forget the regular application of sunscreen. As I walk down the\nstreets of Charlotte Amalie in my fluorescent Icon of the Seas cap, an old\nRastafarian stares me down. \u201cRedneck,\u201d he hisses.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I want to tell him, as I bring a hand up to my red neck, \u201cthat\u2019s not who\nI am at all. On my island, Mannahatta, as Whitman would have it, I am an\ninteresting person living within an engaging artistic milieu. I do not wish to\nuse the Caribbean as a dumping ground for the cruise-ship industry. I love the\nwork of Derek Walcott. You don\u2019t understand. I am not a redneck. And if I am,\nthey did this to me.\u201d They meaning Royal Caribbean? Its passengers? The Rands?\n\n\u201cThey did this to me!\u201d\n\nBack on the Icon, some older matrons are muttering about a run-in with\npassengers from the Celebrity cruise ship docked next to us, the Celebrity\nApex. Although Celebrity Cruises is also owned by Royal Caribbean, I am made\nto understand that there is a deep fratricidal beef between passengers of the\ntwo lines. \u201cWe met a woman from the Apex,\u201d one matron says, \u201cand she says it\nwas a small ship and there was nothing to do. Her face was as tight as a\n19-year-old\u2019s, she had so much surgery.\u201d With those words, and beneath a\ncloudy sky, humidity shrouding our weathered faces and red necks, we set sail\nonce again, hopefully in the direction of home.\n\nInside the AquaDome, one can find a food hall and an acrobatic sound-and-light\naquatic show. (Gary Shteyngart)\n\n#### Day 6\n\nTHERE ARE BARELY 48 HOURS LEFT to the cruise, and the Icon of the Seas\u2019\npassengers are salty. They know how to work the elevators. They know the Washy\nWashy song by heart. They understand that the chicken gyro at \u201cFeta\nMediterranean,\u201d in the AquaDome Market, is the least problematic form of\nchicken on the ship.\n\nThe passengers have shed their INAUGURAL CRUISE T-shirts and are now starting\nto evince political opinions. There are caps pledging to make America great\nagain and T-shirts that celebrate words sometimes attributed to Patrick Henry:\n\u201cThe Constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the\npeople; it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government.\u201d With\ntheir preponderance of FAMILY FLAG FAITH FRIENDS FIREARMS T-shirts, the tables\nby the crepe station sometimes resemble the Capitol Rotunda on January 6. The\nReal Anthony Fauci, by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., appears to be a popular form of\nliterature, especially among young men with very complicated versions of the\nAmerican flag on their T-shirts. Other opinions blend the personal and the\npolitical. \u201cSomeone needs to kill Washy guy, right?\u201d a well-dressed man in the\nelevator tells me, his gray eyes radiating nothing. \u201cJust beat him to death.\nAm I right?\u201d I overhear the male member of a young couple whisper, \u201cThere goes\nthat freak\u201d as I saunter by in my white spa robe, and I decide to retire it\nfor the rest of the cruise.\n\nI visit the Royal Bling to see up close the $100,000 golden chalice that\nentitles you to free drinks on Royal Caribbean forever. The pleasant Serbian\nsaleslady explains that the chalice is actually gold-plated and covered in\nwhite zirconia instead of diamonds, as it would otherwise cost $1 million. \u201cIf\nyou already have everything,\u201d she explains, \u201cthis is one more thing you can\nget.\u201d\n\nI believe that anyone who works for Royal Caribbean should be entitled to\nimmediate American citizenship. They already speak English better than most of\nthe passengers and, per the Serbian lady\u2019s sales pitch above, better\nunderstand what America is as well. Crew members like my Panamanian cabin\nattendant seem to work 24 hours a day. A waiter from New Delhi tells me that\nhis contract is six months and three weeks long. After a cruise ends, he says,\n\u201cin a few hours, we start again for the next cruise.\u201d At the end of the half a\nyear at sea, he is allowed a two-to-three-month stay at home with his family.\nAs of 2019, the median income for crew members was somewhere in the vicinity\nof $20,000, according to a major business publication. Royal Caribbean would\nnot share the current median salary for its crew members, but I am certain\nthat it amounts to a fraction of the cost of a Royal Bling gold-plated,\nzirconia-studded chalice.\n\nAnd because most of the Icon\u2019s hyper-sanitized spaces are just a frittata away\nfrom being a Delta lounge, one forgets that there are actual sailors on this\nship, charged with the herculean task of docking it in port. \u201cHaving driven\n100,000-ton aircraft carriers throughout my career,\u201d retired Admiral James G.\nStavridis, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, writes to me, \u201cI\u2019m\nnot sure I would even know where to begin with trying to control a sea monster\nlike this one nearly three times the size.\u201d (I first met Stavridis while\ntouring Army bases in Germany more than a decade ago.)\n\nToday, I decide to head to the hot tub near Swim & Tonic, where some of the\nship\u2019s drunkest reprobates seem to gather (the other tubs are filled with\nfamilies and couples). The talk here, like everywhere else on the ship,\nconcerns football, a sport about which I know nothing. It is apparent that\nfour teams have recently competed in some kind of finals for the year, and\nthat two of them will now face off in the championship. Often when people on\nthe Icon speak, I will try to repeat the last thing they said with a laugh or\na nod of disbelief. \u201cYes, 20-yard line! Ha!\u201d \u201cOh my God, of course,\nscrimmage.\u201d\n\nSoon we are joined in the hot tub by the late-middle-age drunk guy with the\nduck necklace. He is wearing a bucket hat with the legend HAWKEYES, which, I\nsoon gather, is yet another football team. \u201cAll right, who turned me in?\u201d Duck\nNecklace says as he plops into the tub beside us. \u201cI get a call in the\nmorning,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s security. Can you come down to the dining room by 10\na.m.? You need to stay away from the members of this religious family.\u201d\nApparently, the gregarious Duck Necklace had photobombed the wrong people.\nThere are several families who present as evangelical Christians or practicing\nMuslims on the ship. One man, evidently, was not happy that Duck Necklace had\nmade contact with his relatives. \u201cIt\u2019s because of religious stuff; he was\noffended. I put my arm around 20 people a day.\u201d\n\nEveryone laughs. \u201cThey asked me three times if I needed medication,\u201d he says\nof the security people who apparently interrogated him in full view of others\nhaving breakfast.\n\nAnother hot-tub denizen suggests that he should have asked for fentanyl. After\na few more drinks, Duck Necklace begins to muse about what it would be like to\nfall off the ship. \u201cI\u2019m 62 and I\u2019m ready to go,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t want a\nshark to eat me. I\u2019m a huge God guy. I\u2019m a Bible guy. There\u2019s some Mayan\ntheory squaring science stuff with religion. There is so much more to life on\nEarth.\u201d We all nod into our Red Stripes.\n\n\u201cI never get off the ship when we dock,\u201d he says. He tells us he lost $6,000\nin the casino the other day. Later, I look him up, and it appears that on\nland, he\u2019s a financial adviser in a crisp gray suit, probably a pillar of his\nNorth Chicago community.\n\nDespite the prevalence of ice cream, the author lost two pounds on the cruise.\n(Gary Shteyngart)\n\n#### Day 7\n\nTHE OCEAN IS TEEMING with fascinating life, but on the surface it has little\nto teach us. The waves come and go. The horizon remains ever far away.\n\nI am constantly told by my fellow passengers that \u201ceverybody here has a\nstory.\u201d Yes, I want to reply, but everybody everywhere has a story. You, the\nreader of this essay, have a story, and yet you\u2019re not inclined to jump on a\ncruise ship and, like Duck Necklace, tell your story to others at great pitch\nand volume. Maybe what they\u2019re saying is that everybody on this ship wants to\nhave a bigger, more coherent, more interesting story than the one they\u2019ve been\ngiven. Maybe that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much signage on the doors around me\nattesting to marriages spent on the sea. Maybe that\u2019s why the Royal Caribbean\nnewsletter slipped under my door tells me that \u201cthis isn\u2019t a vacation day\nspent\u2014it\u2019s bragging rights earned.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m so lonely.\n\nToday is a big day for Icon passengers. Today the ship docks at Royal\nCaribbean\u2019s own Bahamian island, the Perfect Day at CocoCay. (This appears to\nbe the actual name of the island.) A comedian at the nightclub opined on what\nhis perfect day at CocoCay would look like\u2014receiving oral sex while learning\nthat his ex-wife had been killed in a car crash (big laughter). But the\nreality of the island is far less humorous than that.\n\nOne of the ethnic tristate ladies in the infinity pool told me that she loved\nCocoCay because it had exactly the same things that could be found on the ship\nitself. This proves to be correct. It is like the Icon, but with sand. The\nsame tired burgers, the same colorful tubes conveying children and water from\nPoint A to B. The same swim-up bar at its Hideaway ($140 for admittance, no\nchildren allowed; Royal Caribbean must be printing money off its clientele).\n\u201cThere was almost a fight at The Wizard of Oz,\u201d I overhear an elderly woman\ntell her companion on a chaise lounge. Apparently one of the passengers began\nrecording Royal Caribbean\u2019s intellectual property and \u201cthree guys came after\nhim.\u201d\n\nI walk down a pathway to the center of the island, where a sign reads DO NOT\nENTER: YOU HAVE REACHED THE BOUNDARY OF ADVENTURE. I hear an animal scampering\nin the bushes. A Royal Caribbean worker in an enormous golf cart soon chases\nme down and takes me back to the Hideaway, where I run into Mrs. Rand in a\nbikini. She becomes livid telling me about an altercation she had the other\nday with a woman over a towel and a deck chair. We Suites have special towel\nprivileges; we do not have to hand over our SeaPass Card to score a towel. But\nthe Rands are not Suites. \u201cPeople are so entitled here,\u201d Mrs. Rand says. \u201cIt\u2019s\nlike the airport with all its classes.\u201d \u201cYou see,\u201d I want to say, \u201cthis is\nwhere your husband\u2019s love of Ayn Rand runs into the cruelties and arbitrary\nindignities of unbridled capitalism.\u201d Instead we make plans to meet for a\nfinal drink in the Schooner Bar tonight (the Rands will stand me up).\n\nBack on the ship, I try to do laps, but the pool (the largest on any cruise\nship, naturally) is fully trashed with the detritus of American life: candy\nwrappers, a slowly dissolving tortilla chip, napkins. I take an extra-long\nshower in my suite, then walk around the perimeter of the ship on a kind of\nexercise track, past all the alluring lifeboats in their yellow-and-white\nlivery. Maybe there is a dystopian angle to the HBO series that I will surely\nend up pitching, one with shades of WALL-E or Snowpiercer. In a collapsed\nworld, a Royal Caribbean\u2013like cruise liner sails from port to port, collecting\nnew shipmates and supplies in exchange for the precious energy it has on\nboard. (The actual Icon features a new technology that converts passengers\u2019\npoop into enough energy to power the waterslides. In the series, this shitty\ntechnology would be greatly expanded.) A very young woman (18? 19?), smart and\nlonely, who has only known life on the ship, walks along the same track as I\ndo now, contemplating jumping off into the surf left by its wake. I picture\nreusing Duck Necklace\u2019s words in the opening shot of the pilot. The girl is\nwalking around the track, her eyes on the horizon; maybe she\u2019s highborn\u2014a\nSuite\u2014and we hear the voice-over: \u201cI\u2019m 19 and I\u2019m ready to go. I just don\u2019t\nwant a shark to eat me.\u201d\n\nBefore the cruise is finished, I talk to Mr. Washy Washy, or Nielbert of the\nPhilippines. He is a sweet, gentle man, and I thank him for the earworm of a\nsong he has given me and for keeping us safe from the dreaded norovirus. \u201cThis\nis very important to me, getting people to wash their hands,\u201d he tells me in\nhis burger getup. He has dreams, as an artist and a performer, but they are\nlimited in scope. One day he wants to dress up as a piece of bacon for the\nmorning shift.\n\n#### Epilogue\n\nTHE MAIDEN VOYAGE OF THE TITANIC (the Icon of the Seas is five times as large\nas that doomed vessel) at least offered its passengers an exciting ending to\ntheir cruise, but when I wake up on the eighth day, all I see are the gray\nghosts that populate Miami\u2019s condo skyline. Throughout my voyage, my writer\nfriends wrote in to commiserate with me. Sloane Crosley, who once covered a\nthree-day spa mini-cruise for Vogue, tells me she felt \u201cso very alone ... I\nfound it very untethering.\u201d Gideon Lewis-Kraus writes in an Instagram comment:\n\u201cWhen Gary is done I think it\u2019s time this genre was taken out back and shot.\u201d\nAnd he is right. To badly paraphrase Adorno: After this, no more cruise\nstories. It is unfair to put a thinking person on a cruise ship. Writers\ntypically have difficult childhoods, and it is cruel to remind them of the\ninherent loneliness that drove them to writing in the first place. It is also\nunseemly to write about the kind of people who go on cruises. Our country does\nnot provide the education and upbringing that allow its citizens an interior\nlife. For the creative class to point fingers at the large, breasty gentlemen\nadrift in tortilla-chip-laden pools of water is to gather a sour harvest of\nlow-hanging fruit.\n\nA day or two before I got off the ship, I decided to make use of my balcony,\nwhich I had avoided because I thought the view would only depress me further.\nWhat I found shocked me. My suite did not look out on Central Park after all.\nThis entire time, I had been living in the ship\u2019s Disneyland, Surfside, the\nneighborhood full of screaming toddlers consuming milkshakes and candy. And as\nI leaned out over my balcony, I beheld a slight vista of the sea and surf that\nI thought I had been missing. It had been there all along. The sea was frothy\nand infinite and blue-green beneath the span of a seagull\u2019s wing. And though\nit had been trod hard by the world\u2019s largest cruise ship, it remained.\n\nThis article appears in the May 2024 print edition with the headline \u201cA\nMeatball at Sea.\u201d When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a\ncommission.
