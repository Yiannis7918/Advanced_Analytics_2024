Found\namong its wooden buildings were five canoes, stretching up to 32 feet long and\nmade from hollowed-out trees. Estimated to be 7,000 years old, the boats\nshowed signs of being equipped with advanced maritime technology, including\ntowing accessories and reinforcements.\n\nBecause the original discovery of La Marmotta had only ever been published in\nthe Italian language, widespread study of the canoes and their place in\nhistory remained limited. But now that a team of international researchers\nrevisited the site and published their findings in English in the journal PLOS\nOne, scientists around the world are learning about the boats for the first\ntime\u2014and the bustling, sophisticated Mediterranean trade they suggest.\n\nThe first canoe excavated from La Marmotta, extending some 32 feet long and\nmade of oak. Gibaja et al., 2024, PLOS ONE, CC-BY 4.0\n\n\"These artifacts offer further insights into the daily lives, symbolic and\ntechnological capabilities of the ancient inhabitants,\" says Niccol\u00f2 Mazzucco,\nthe study\u2019s senior author and an archaeologist at the University of Pisa, to\nLiveScience\u2019s Jennifer Nalewicki. \"No other site in the Mediterranean presents\nsuch [an] amount of harvesting tools.\"\n\nThe five canoes are the oldest boats ever found in the Mediterranean, and\namong the ten oldest known in Europe. Radiocarbon dating placed their origins\nbetween 5700 and 5100 B.C.E., and an archaeobotanical study of the canoes\nshowed they were each made from different materials\u2014alder, poplar, oak, beech\nand lime tree wood\u2014allowing for different weights, maneuverability and\nstrength. This variety suggests different strategies and specialization among\nearly Mediterranean villages, the researchers write.\n\n\u201cThey probably had enough knowledge about wood species and their properties to\nchoose them and to use them on the basis of those properties,\u201d Mazzucco says\nto NewScientist\u2019s Christa Lest\u00e9-Lasserre. \u201cThese people were working wood with\nthe same knowledge as a carpenter today, just with different tools.\u201d\n\nAerial and side images show the T-shaped object found at the site, with holes\nlikely drilled for rope, allowing towing. Gibaja et al., 2024, PLOS ONE, CC-BY\n4.0\n\nOne of the most exciting finds has been wooden T-shaped objects, drilled with\ntwo to four holes, that explain how the canoes were outfitted to carry large\nloads. These artifacts \u201care undoubtedly reminiscent of much more recent\nnavigation systems,\u201d the researchers write. The structure suggests the boats\nwere towed using rope, allowing for the movement of goods, people and animals,\nlikely for trade.\n\n\u201cSo, these details are really important because they\u2019re actually a testimony\nof how they could have transported a lot of goods,\u201d Lasse S\u00f8rensen, an\narchaeologist at the National Museum of Denmark who was not involved in the\nstudy, tells Lest\u00e9-Lasserre.\n\nForeign grains, animal remains, pottery, paint, tools and figurines found at\nLa Marmotta further suggest a vibrant ancient trade economy.\n\nArchaeologists returned to La Marmotta, which was originally discovered in\n1989. Gibaja et al., 2024, PLOS ONE, CC-BY 4.0\n\nThe canoes may also have been outfitted with sails, outriggers or support\nfloats, the study suggests. Some of the smallest canoes were likely used for\nfishing trips. Both short- and long-distance travel would be possible, the\nresearchers write. In 1998, a team built a reproduction of a canoe found at La\nMarmotta and sailed nearly 500 miles around the Mediterranean Sea. Covering 30\nmiles per day in good conditions, they estimated that the experienced\nseafaring villagers must have been able to cover much more ground.\n\nThe complex construction of the canoes and this evidence of sophisticated\ntrade and travel, the researchers write, also demonstrate a level of social\norganization previously unconsidered of the area at that time.\n\n\u201cIn this way, La Marmotta is causing a literal sea change in our view of those\nfirst Neolithic farming groups,\u201d the team writes.\n\nGet the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.\n\nChristian Thorsberg | READ MORE\n\nChristian Thorsberg is an environmental writer and photographer from Chicago.\nHis work, which often centers on freshwater issues, climate change and\nsubsistence, has appeared in Circle of Blue, Sierra magazine, Discover\nmagazine and Alaska Sporting Journal.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1.
