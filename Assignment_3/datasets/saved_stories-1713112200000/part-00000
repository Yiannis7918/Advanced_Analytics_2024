Up to almost\ninvariably sets a target that can never be achieved, and one spec\u2019s up to may\nbe very different from another. I\u2019m thinking here of Thunderbolt and USB4,\nboth of which claim up to 40 Gb/s, but fail to achieve it in different ways,\nand with different types of Mac. To understand this, we need to read the fine\nprint with care.\n\n#### Different Macs\n\nLook at the fine print in Apple\u2019s specifications for its original Mac mini M1.\nIt has two \u201cThunderbolt / USB 4 ports\u201d with support for:\n\n  * Thunderbolt 3 (up to 40 Gb/s)\n  * USB 4 (up to 40 Gb/s)\n  * USB 3.1 Gen 2 (up to 10 Gb/s).\n\nCompare that with one of the last Intel Macs, such as a MacBook Pro (16-inch,\n2019), with its support for:\n\n  * Thunderbolt (up to 40 Gb/s)\n  * USB 3.1 Gen 2 (up to 10 Gb/s)\n\nwith no mention of USB4, but still claiming the same up to 40 Gb/s.\n\n#### Different up tos\n\nAccording to Intel, Thunderbolt 3 and 4 offer up to 4 lanes of PCI Express 3.0\ntotalling 32.4 Gb/s for general-purpose data transfer, and 4 lanes of\nDisplayPort 1.4 HBR3 for video. So the fastest we can expect from an Intel\nMac\u2019s Thunderbolt ports is 32.4 Gb/s when transferring data with an external\nSSD. We know from long and sometimes bitter experience that means read and\nwrite speeds of up to 3 GB/s, often significantly less than that. So much for\nThunderbolt\u2019s up to 40 Gb/s.\n\nIn contrast, USB4 can support what is technically known as USB4 Gen 3\u00d72,\nmarketed as USB 40Gbps, with a nominal transfer rate of 40 Gb/s or up to 4.8\nGB/s. Because of protocol overheads, in practice that means a suitably fast\nNVMe SSD should clock read and write speeds of well over 3 GB/s, possibly even\ntowards 4 GB/s. That\u2019s USB4\u2019s up to 40 Gb/s.\n\nSo the fastest you\u2019ll see with your Intel Mac\u2019s Thunderbolt ports is up to 3\nGB/s, while a suitable USB4 enclosure running from any Apple silicon Mac\nshould comfortably exceed that if it really does support USB 40Gbps.\n\n#### Down to 10 Gb/s\n\nReady-made external SSDs and enclosures rely on different chips to deliver\nThunderbolt and USB4 support, although few vendors go to the trouble of making\nthis explicit. More expensive certified Thunderbolt models should use Intel\nchips, but some of those can\u2019t manage up to 40 Gb/s, only up to 20 Gb/s. More\nrecent hardware may opt instead for two chips, one to support Thunderbolt, the\nother for a consolation prize to those whose computers are stuck with some\nvariant of USB 3.\n\nThe latest may instead target USB4 at 40 Gb/s and fall back to USB 3.1 Gen 2\nwhen that isn\u2019t available. Those therefore run at better than 3 GB/s with the\nUSB4 support in Apple silicon Macs, but only 1 GB/s of USB 3 when connected to\na port on an Intel Mac. The better vendors will make that clear when\ndescribing their products, but when you buy a brand with an ad hoc name that\nyou\u2019ve not seen before, you may not realise this until you connect the SSD to\nyour Mac.\n\n#### Hubs?\n\nBut what happens if you connect a USB 40Gbps enclosure via a \u201cThunderbolt 4\u201d\nhub? That will depend on which modes the hub can operate in, both to the\nenclosure and back to the Mac, although no hub that I\u2019ve seen makes that\nclear.\n\nIn practice, with my Satechi Thunderbolt 4 Slim Hub I can get 3.0 GB/s write\nand 3.2 GB/s read speeds with a USB4 enclosure, confirming that it\u2019s still\nexceeding the speeds of a directly connected Thunderbolt 3 SSD without USB4\nsupport. Whether that\u2019s also true of other recent \u201cThunderbolt 4\u201d hubs, such\nas the CalDigit Element and Plugable Thunderbolt 4, I don\u2019t know.\n\n#### Over and out\n\nAfter several days testing the latest Express 1M2 enclosure from OWC, I have\nchanged my recommendations for the best external SSDs. Previously I had chosen\nthe relatively reliable Thunderbolt 3 up to 3 GB/s, even though few drives\never seemed capable of achieving that up to. If you\u2019re still needing good\nperformance with an Intel Mac, that makes sense.\n\nBut if you need best performance with an Apple silicon Mac, you\u2019re far better\noff with a high-quality USB 40Gbps enclosure such as OWC\u2019s Express 1M2, which\nshould reliably return over 3 GB/s even through a compatible hub. I much\nprefer the word over to up to.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Reddit\n  * Pinterest\n  * Email\n  * Print\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nShopping for a faster external SSDFebruary 20, 2024In \"Macs\"\n\nExplainer: ThunderboltApril 30, 2022In \"Macs\"\n\nWhich external drives have Trim and SMART support?April 9, 2024In \"Macs\"\n\nPosted in General and tagged Apple silicon, hub, Intel, performance, SSD,\nThunderbolt, USB 3, USB4.
