We\u2019re using together.ai for\nthe qapair generation with Mixtral, and we just got a surprise $1K bill.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the GPUs we run the finetunes on cost money too, and our runpod\nbill is about $2-3K per month. I\u2019m currently paying both of these bills out of\nmy personal savings (plus the electricity to run the two GPUs I run in my home\ndata center!).\n\nWhen long-running finetunes eat up all our GPU resources, we can\u2019t serve\ninference requests, and increasingly we\u2019ve had all our GPUs allocated to fine-\ntuning. I\u2019m happy users are finding the fine tuning service interesting and\nhopefully useful enough to kick off those runs!\n\nBut tl;dr - We\u2019re a bootstrapped startup, and so in order to keep the SaaS\nrunning we\u2019ve had to limit the size of documents you can fine-tune for free.\nFree-tier finetunes are now limited to 5 chunks, about one page of text. To\nfinetune larger datasets (up to 1000 chunks), please upgrade to the premium\ntier which is just $20/month. You can upgrade at\nhttps://app.tryhelix.ai/account. To train above 1000 chunks (~200 pages),\nplease get in touch.\n\nEven if you just like what we\u2019re doing, please subscribe to support us!\n\nGo on, click that sweet subscribe button \ud83d\ude05\n\nNew stuff we\u2019ve done recently:\n\n  * Tools launch & demo at Ollama meetup in Paris (8 minutes)\n\n  * GPTScript in microVMs in Helix (including in the SaaS):\n\nhttps://twitter.com/lmarsden/status/1773401443355054351\n\n  * New \u201cfull platform\u201d vision articlated on updated homepage:\n\nhttps://tryhelix.ai/\n\nAs ever, any complaints or comments come find us in Discord please :-)\n\nCheers, Luke CEO, HelixML\n\n### Subscribe to HelixML\n\nBy Luke Marsden \u00b7 Launched 4 months ago\n\nHelix brings the best of open source AI to your business\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Bootstrapped SaaS startup: New limits on fine tuning on Helix free plan\n\nhelixml.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nHow we got fine-tuning Mistral-7B to not suck: Helix Project Report, Feb 2024\n\nAnnouncing Helix v0.5 with improved text fine-tuning and OpenAI API support \ud83c\udf89\n\nFeb 6 \u2022\n\nLuke Marsden\n\n20\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How we got fine-tuning Mistral-7B to not suck: Helix Project Report, Feb\n2024\n\nhelixml.substack.com\n\n9\n\nIntegrating business APIs with open source LLMs: Announcing Helix Tools\n\nMaking open source AI work, now in Helix 0.6.3\n\nMar 21 \u2022\n\nLuke Marsden\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Integrating business APIs with open source LLMs: Announcing Helix Tools\n\nhelixml.substack.com\n\nRunning Ollama server-side\n\nHow to run Ollama on a server and handle multiple requests to saturate the GPU\nmemory\n\nMar 21 \u2022\n\nKarolis\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Running Ollama server-side\n\nhelixml.substack.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Luke Marsden\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
