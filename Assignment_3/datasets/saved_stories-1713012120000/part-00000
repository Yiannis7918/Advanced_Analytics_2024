While another Delta flight from Austin\nwas permitted to climb to the right altitude to complete a maneuver called an\nS-curve, the airline said the Dallas flight was not.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\n###### 2024 total solar eclipse\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nA total solar eclipse passed across the United States on Monday, April 8. See\nphotos and videos from the path of totality and read our reporters\u2019 coverage\nfrom scenes across the nation.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the next total solar eclipse happening in the U.S.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration did not comment on the Delta flight\u2019s path\nspecifically, but said that the agency was focused on safety as jets and\nnoncommercial planes filled the air to view the eclipse above the clouds. The\nFAA had previously warned about congestion and possible impacts to air\ntraffic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur first goal and our top priority is always the safety of flights,\u201d said\nFAA spokesman Chris Mullooly. \u201cWe knew that there were going to be possible\nimpacts to some of the traffic.\u201d\n\nInstead of its planned maneuvers, Delta\u2019s Airbus A321neo flew in a circle to\ngive both sides a look from 33,000 feet. But passengers didn\u2019t get the view\nthey expected.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cI kind of immediately suspected the positioning was off,\u201d said passenger\nDimitrije Ratkov, who raised the possibility the flight missed totality to The\nPost on Thursday. \u201cI knew something had gone wrong, but wasn\u2019t sure what.\u201d\n\nDelta had warned about such a possibility, even as passengers paid more than\n$1,000 in some cases for a seat. For both the Dallas and Austin flights, the\nairline included this disclaimer: \u201cWhile Delta flight plans have been designed\nto maximize time within the path of totality, this is subject to change due to\nfactors outside of Delta\u2019s control such as weather and air traffic control\nthat could impact timing and aircraft.\u201d\n\nOn board flight 1010, passengers \u2014 including this reporter, who paid nearly\n$850 for a refundable ticket \u2014 craned their necks to catch a glimpse of the\nsun. \u201cCan you see it?\u201d turned into \u201cDid you see it?\u201d as the plane turned. The\nsky and ground grew darker, but glimpses of the sun were brief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSeveral people captured photos of the sun partially blocked by the moon, later\nshowing off thumbnails of glowing orange. They chalked the difficulty up to\nthe tricky angle of the sun high above, speed of the plane and confines of the\naircraft.\n\nWhile the flight was full of media, the movement outside the prime eclipse\npath was not discovered until Ratkov, a PhD student in virology at Mayo\nClinic, compared the path of the flight to that of the eclipse using a flight-\ntracking site and NASA\u2019s eclipse map. He posted his videos on YouTube and sent\nemails to reporters with the subject line: \u201cDallas Eclipse Flight Made Wrong\nTurn and Exited Path of Totality.\u201d\n\nDelta did not confirm the accuracy of Ratkov\u2019s video, but acknowledged after\nlooking into questions from The Post that the plane went out of the path of\ntotality. Flight-tracking sites Flightradar24 and FlightAware show the plane\nmaking the circle southeast of Jonesboro, Ark.\n\nThe first flight Delta announced for the eclipse, from Austin, appeared on\nFlightradar24 to stay within the path. Photos from that flight clearly showed\ndarker skies and the sun blocked by the moon, though Detroit Free Press\nphotographer Eric Seals wrote on Instagram that even that was \u201cvery hard to\nphotograph.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMany passengers on the Dallas flight told The Post on Monday that while they\nwere disappointed they didn\u2019t have a better vantage point, they enjoyed the\nexperience anyway. The airline threw parties before takeoff and after landing,\nand placed bags full of special socks, hats, snacks and other trinkets on\nseats.\n\nThe flight\u2019s captain told The Post on Monday that those on the left side of\nthe plane probably had the best view, and said the flight got a little over\nthree minutes to view totality. He told USA Today: \u201cIt was great. It really\nwent off without a hitch.\u201d\n\nKyle Carter, a private pilot and stay-at-home dad from Orlando, said Monday\nthat he was happy to have seen the moon\u2019s shadow racing toward the plane from\nbehind. He said Friday that, as a pilot, he understood in advance that several\nfactors could make the experience less than ideal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cI would still do it again,\u201d he said. \u201cI went into it with that kind of\nbackground knowledge. It was not a sure thing to me that we were going to see\nit.\u201d\n\nRatkov, who paid just over $1,100 for a refundable ticket, said he started\ntraveling from Minnesota early Sunday morning, slept that night at the airport\nin Dallas and made it home around 6 a.m. Tuesday. He said the mood in his row\nwas chatty and upbeat leading up to totality, but downcast afterward.\n\nAfter the airline put out a celebratory news release and much coverage was\npositive, he said he wanted the record about the flight to be corrected and\nfor Delta to provide an explanation for what happened.\n\n\u201cIt was a major disappointment,\u201d and a big financial investment, he said. \u201cIt\nhad been obviously promoted as the second eclipse flight.\u201d\n\n### 2024 total solar eclipse\n\nA total solar eclipse passed across the United States on Monday, April 8.
