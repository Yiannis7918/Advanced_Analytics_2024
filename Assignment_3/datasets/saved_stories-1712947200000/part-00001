As a\nresult, the Ukraine war grinds on as Russia has managed to sidestep much of\nthe economic damage that sanctions were expected to deliver. However, while\nthe Russian economy is surviving, it certainly isn\u2019t thriving.\n\nIn order to stay afloat, Russia needs to explore more alliances and options\nfor exports and trade partners. With no sign of relations with the West\nthawing any time soon, Russia seems to be betting big on the nuclear energy\nsector and nuclear fuel exports. The Kremlin also seems to be scouting out new\neconomic alliances in emerging economies, and particularly in Africa.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn general, energy ventures in African countries have enormous growth\npotential as the continent faces rapid industrialization paired with massive\npopulation growth. Nuclear offers a particularly alluring option to African\nnations that are faced with the stark challenge of growing their economies\nwhile \u2018leapfrogging\u2019 over the development of the continent\u2019s abundant fossil\nfuel resources straight to clean energy development and buildout.\n\nNuclear offers reliable, baseload power without any carbon emissions, and\ndoesn\u2019t have the energy security issues associated with the variability of\nrenewable energies such as solar and wind power, which produce in accordance\nwith weather patterns rather than to meet demand. This makes the addition of\nnuclear energy production capacity a particularly promising way forward for\nAfrica, which already deals with significant energy security woes. Across the\ncontinent, about 600 million people lack access to electricity today. And even\nin countries that do have developed energy grids, such as South Africa,\nrolling blackouts are a common occurrence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAll of this is to say that the African nuclear sector is likely poised for\nenormous growth. Over the past year, a number of African countries including\nUganda, Rwanda and Kenya have announced plans to build nuclear reactors. This\npush comes as part of a broader global effort to increase investment in\nnuclear energy expansion as the climate change doomsday clock keeps ticking\never closer to midnight. Africa\u2019s nuclear energy sector, in particular, has\nnowhere to go but up as nations across the continent need all the energy\naddition they can get.\n\nAnd Russia wants to capitalize on that enormous investment opportunity. On a\nglobal level, Russian state-operated nuclear energy firm Rosatom is one of the\nprimary exporters of nuclear fuel, uranium enrichment services, and funding\nfor the construction of new nuclear facilities. This last service is\nparticularly critical in developing economies, as building a new nuclear plant\nis prohibitively expensive for nearly any private company, even in locations\nwith strong economies and currencies. As a result, nearly one in five nuclear\npower plants on the planet is either in Russia or is Russian-built. And any\nexpansion in worldwide nuclear power deployment is therefore a boon to the\nKremlin\u2019s bottom line.\n\nAlready, Russia is making aggressive plays to get in on the ground floor of\nAfrica\u2019s nuclear energy revolution in what the Financial Times recently called\na \u201chigh-profile charm offensive.\u201d Rosatom recently publicized nuclear energy\n\u201cco-operation\u201d agreements inked with Mali, Burkina Faso and Algeria. This will\nbuild on Russia\u2019s current construction efforts in Egypt, where Rosatom is\nalready building a fourth reactor at the $30bn El Dabaa nuclear power plant.\nThe plant, located outside of Cario, is one of the biggest nuclear\nconstruction projects in the world. In order to build the mega-project, Egypt\nhas borrowed a hefty $25 billion from Russia, to be repaid over next 35 years\nwith 3% annual interest.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome experts have warned that this is a dangerous dependence for emerging\neconomies such as Egypt and other African nations. \u201cThe drawback is that the\ncountry develops a strong long-term dependence on Russia to meet one of its\nmost basic needs: electricity provision,\u201d says Hartmut Winkler, professor of\nphysics at the University of Johannesburg. Leaning on a country that is\ncurrently at war, and therefore not the most reliable of trade partners,\nthreatens \u201cdisruption and ultimate termination of projects already in place.\u201d\nThis is particularly troubling in the context of nuclear power plants, which\ntake over a decade to build.\n\nBy Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\n  * Argentina Taps Waste Gas To Mine Bitcoin\n  * Iran Adapts to Shifting Tides in South Caucasus\n  * North Sea Oil and Gas Firms Continue Drilling Despite Climate Goals\n\n##### Download The Free Oilprice App Today\n\nBack to homepage\n\n### Around the Web\n\nFACEBOOK Twitter GOOGLE+ LINKEDIN REDDIT PRINT\n\nPrevious Post\n\nPrinceton Scientists Unveil Breakthrough in Fusion Reactor Technology\n\nNext Post\n\nDeficit in Grid Capacity Threatens European Energy Policy Targets\n\n### Haley Zaremba\n\nHaley Zaremba is a writer and journalist based in Mexico City.

And with its world class expertise in nuclear technology and the\nconstruction of nuclear plants around the world, it can certainly help African\ncountries get access to nuclear power under strict guidelines and security\nguarantees.\n\nBut what Africa needs most right away isn't the luxury of access to nuclear\nenergy but overcoming its chronic energy poverty. For that it needs\ninvestments and technical knowhow for developing its vast oil and gas reserves\nand quickly. .That is where Russia could be of greatest help to Africa.\n\nDr Mamdouh G Salameh International Oil Economist Global Energy Expert\n\n### Most Popular\n\nGas Glut?
