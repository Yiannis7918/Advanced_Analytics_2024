He describes the\nresearch he his doing to improve the code search experience of Val Town. It\nwas a great read, and you might have seen it trending on Hacker News.\n\nAs Val Town's most active user (behind Steve Krouse, one of the founders of\nVal Town), I for sure agree with Tom that search feature needs improvements.\nBut while reading his post, I immediately thought of a different approach to\nthe problem. And a few hours later, Val Town Search was born.\n\n## Do things that don't scale\n\nHow does this new shiny search engine work? Well, it's quite simple.\n\n  1. I wrote a Deno script that fetches all vals from the Val Town API.\n  2. I pushed the data to a Github Repository\n  3. I added a Github Action that runs the script every hour to refresh the data.\n  4. I created a simple frontend on top of the Github Search API that allows you to search the data. It's hosted on Val Town (obviously).\n\nThat was it. I didn't have to build a complex search engine, I just used the\ntools that were available to me.\n\nIs this a scalable solution for Val Town? Probably not. Am I abusing the\nGithub API? Maybe. Does it work better than the current search feature of Val\nTown? Absolutely!\n\nI hope that the val.town engineers will come up with a search feature that\nwill put my little project to shame. But for now, you won't find a better way\nto search for vals than Val Town Search.\n\nPS: This post was written / is served from Val Town\n\n", "frontpage": false}
