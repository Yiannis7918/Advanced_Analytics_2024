To address these challenges,\nwe propose UMBRAE, a unified multimodal decoding of brain signals. First, to\nextract instance-level conceptual and spatial details from neural signals, we\nintroduce an efficient universal brain encoder for multimodal-brain alignment\nand recover object descriptions at multiple levels of granularity from\nsubsequent multimodal large language model (MLLM). Second, we introduce a\ncross-subject training strategy that maps subject-specific features to a\ncommon feature space. This allows a model to be trained on multiple subjects\nwithout extra resources, even yielding superior results compared to subject-\nspecific models. We further show that it supports weakly-supervised adaptation\nto new subjects, with only a fraction of the total training data. Experiments\ndemonstrate that UMBRAE not only achieves superior results in the newly-\nintroduced grounding tasks but also outperforms methods in well established\ntasks. To assess our method, we construct and share with the community a\ncomprehensive brain understanding benchmark BrainHub.\n\nKeywords: Multimodal Brain Decoding, Efficient Brain Encoder, Cross-Subject\nTraining, Weakly-Supervised Adaptation, Large Language Model\n\n## Method\n\nUMBRAE decodes multimodal explanations from brain signals. (1) We introduce a\nuniversal brain encoder for multimodal-brain alignment and recover conceptual\nand spatial details by using multimodal large language models. (2) We\nintroduce cross-subject training to overcome unique brain patterns of\ndifferent individuals. This allows brain signals from multiple subjects to be\ntrained within the same model. (3) Our method supports weakly-supervised\nsubject adaptation, enabling the training of a model for a new subject in a\ndata-efficient manner. (4) For evaluation, we introduce BrainHub, a brain\nunderstanding benchmark, based on NSD and COCO.\n\nOverview of UMBRAE. Our brain encoder includes subject-specific tokenizers and\na universal perceive encoder. Brain signals from multiple subjects are mapped\ninto a common feature space, enabling cross-subject training and weakly-\nsupervised subject adaptation. The brain encoder learns to align neural\nsignals with image features. During inference, the learned encoder interacts\nwith MLLMs and performs brain understanding tasks according to given prompts.\n\n## Demo Examples\n\nUMBRAE decodes multimodal explanations from brain signals.\n\n## Brain Captioning\n\nBrain Captioning aims at textually describing the primary content of a given\nbrain response. Here are the brain captioning comparison (on S1). The\nBaselines include SDRecon, BrainCap, and OneLLM. UMBRAE-S1 refers to our model\ntrained only with subject S1, while UMBRAE denotes the model with cross-\nsubject training.

Results for all four subjects (S1, S2,\nS5, and S7) are from our cross-subject UMBRAE model.\n\nReference| Captioning  \n---|---  \n| COCO| A bathroom with a vanity mirror sitting above a toilet next to a\nbathtub.  \n---|---  \nShikra-w/img| A bathroom with a toilet, sink and a television.  \nS1| A bathroom with a toilet, sink and mirror.  \nS2| A bathroom with a sink, mirror and toilet.  \nS5| A kitchen with a stove, sink, and cabinets  \nS7| A bathroom with a toilet, sink and bathtub.  \n| COCO| A picture of a cat and some luggage.  \n---|---  \nShikra-w/img| A cat sitting on a suitcase with clothes on a table.  \nS1| A cat is sitting on top of a closed suitcase.  \nS2| A cat is laying down on a soft surface.  \nS5| A cat is laying on top of a bed.  \nS7| A cat laying on top of a bed in a room.  \n| COCO| A large field of grass with sheep grazing on the land.  \n---|---  \nShikra-w/img| A herd of sheep graze in a lush green field.  \nS1| A large mountain range filled with lots of trees.  \nS2| The image shows a great wilderness of mountains.  \nS5| A large mountain range is shown with a sky in the background.  \nS7| A large field with a mountain range in the background.  \n| COCO| A man riding a snowboard down a hill.  \n---|---  \nShikra-w/img| A skier is going down a snowy hill.  \nS1| A person in a ski outfit skiing down a slope.  \nS2| A man riding a surfboard on top of a wave.  \nS5| A person on skis is skiing on a snowy slope.  \nS7| A person riding a snowboard on top of a snow covered slope.  \n| COCO| Double decker bus on the street next to buildings.  \n---|---  \nShikra-w/img| A double decker bus is parked outside a building.  \nS1| A transit bus riding down a street with buildings around.  \nS2| A passenger bus that is driving down the street.  \nS5| A large bus is traveling down the street.  \nS7| A bus driving down the street near another bus.  \n| COCO| A person holding a tennis racket in their hand.  \n---|---  \nShikra-w/img| A young man in an orange shirt playing tennis.  \nS1| A woman holding a tennis racquet on top of a tennis court.  \nS2| A woman holding a tennis racket on a tennis court.  \nS5| A woman standing on a tennis court holding a racket.  \nS7| A man holding a tennis racquet on a tennis court.  \n  \n## Brain Grounding\n\nBrain Grounding is the counterpart of visual grounding and seeks to recover\nspatial locations from brain signals by inferring coordinates. Here are the\nBrain Grounding results from UMBRAE using different task prompts. Reference\nimages are visual stimuli for input brain responses and are just used here for\nvisualization.\n\nBelow are the UMBRAE Brain Grounding results of different subjects.\n\n## Brain Retrieval\n\nThe forward retrieval (top) is to find the correct image embedding given a\nbrain embedding. Conversely, the backward retrieval (bottom) aims to locate\nthe correct brain embedding given an image embedding.\n\n## Visual Decoding\n\nDespite that our method is not specifically designed for the task of visual\ndecoding (fMRI-to-image reconstruction), our predicted textual and visual cues\ncan be used for the final image reconstruction by using a variety of\npretrained image generation models. These models include text-to-image SD, SD-\nXL, and Kandinsky3, a layout-to-image GLIGEN, and a multiple-condition\nVersatile Diffusion.\n\n## BrainHub\n\nFor evaluation, we introduce BrainHub, a brain understanding benchmark, based\non NSD and COCO.\n\nThere are 982 test images, 80 classes, 4,913 captions, and 5,829\nboundingboxes. For grounding evaluation, we further group the 80 classes of\nCOCO into 4 salience categories according to their salience in images: Salient\n(S), Salient Creatures (SC), Salient Objects (SO), and Inconspicuous (I). The\nillustration shows the statistics and mapping of our categories, w.r.t. COCO\nclasses.\n\n## BibTex\n\n@article{xia2024umbrae, title={UMBRAE: Unified Multimodal Decoding of Brain\nSignals}, author={Xia, Weihao and de Charette, Raoul and \u00d6ztireli, Cengiz and\nXue, Jing-Hao}, booktitle={arxiv preprint:arxiv 2404.07202}, year={2024} }\n\nAcknowledgements: The project template is taken from DreamBooth.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
