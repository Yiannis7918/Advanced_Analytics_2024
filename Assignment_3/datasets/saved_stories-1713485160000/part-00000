This breakthrough test flight,\nduring which a pilot was in the X-62A's cockpit as a failsafe, was the\nculmination of a series of milestones that led 2023 to be the year that \"made\nmachine learning a reality in the air,\" according to one official. These\ndevelopments are a potentially game-changing means to an end that will feed\ndirectly into future advanced uncrewed aircraft programs like the U.S. Air\nForce's Collaborative Combat Aircraft effort.\n\nDetails about the autonomous air-to-air test flight were included in a new\nvideo about the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Air Combat\nEvolution (ACE) program and its achievements in 2023. The U.S. Air Force,\nthrough the Air Force Test Pilot School (USAF TPS) and the Air Force Research\nLaboratory (AFRL), is a key participant in the ACE effort. A wide array of\nindustry and academic partners are also involved in ACE. This includes Shield\nAI, which acquired Heron Systems in 2021. Heron developed the artificial\nintelligence (AI) 'pilot' that won DARPA's AlphaDogfight Trials the preceding\nyear, which were conducted in an entirely digital environment, and\nsubsequently fed directly into ACE.\n\n\"2023 was the year ACE made machine learning a reality in the air,\" Air Force\nLt. Col. Ryan Hefron, the ACE program manager, says in the newly released\nvideo, seen in full below.\n\nDARPA, together with the Air Force and Lockheed Martin, had first begun\nintegrating the so-called artificial intelligence or machine learning \"agents\"\ninto the X-62A's systems back in 2022 and conducted the first autonomous test\nflights of the jet using those algorithms in December of that year. That\nmilestone was publicly announced in February 2023.\n\nThe X-62A, which is a heavily modified two-seat F-16D, is also known as the\nVariable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft (VISTA). Its flight\nsystems can be configured to mimic those of virtually any other aircraft,\nwhich makes it a unique surrogate for a wide variety of testing purposes that\nrequire a real-world platform. This also makes VISTA an ideal platform for\nsupporting work like ACE.\n\nA stock picture of the X-62A VISTA test jet. USAF\n\n\"So we have an integrated space within VISTA in the flight controls that\nallows for artificial intelligence agents to send commands into VISTA as if\nthey were sending commands into the simulated model of VISTA,\" Que Harris, the\nlead flight controls engineer for the X-62A at Lockheed Martin, says in the\nnew ACE video. Harris also described this as a \"sandbox for autonomy\" within\nthe jet.\n\nThe X-62A's original designation was NF-16D, but it received its new X-plane\nnomenclature in 2021 ahead of being modified specifically to help support\nfuture advanced autonomy test work. Calspan, which is on contract with the\nUSAF TPS to support the X-62A's operations, was a finalist for the 2023\nCollier Trophy for its work with the test jet, but did not ultimately win.\nAwarded annually by the National Aeronautic Association, the Collier Trophy\nrecognizes \"the greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics in\nAmerica, with respect to improving the performance, efficiency, and safety of\nair or space vehicles, the value of which has been thoroughly demonstrated by\nactual use during the preceding year,\" according to the organization's\nwebsite.\n\n\"So, think of a simulator laboratory that you would have at a research\nfacility,\" Dr. Chris Cotting, the Director of Research at the USAF TPS, also\nsays in the video. \"We have taken the entire simulator laboratory and crammed\nit into an F-16.\"\n\nThe video below shows the X-62A flying in formation with an F-16C and an F-22\nRaptor stealth fighter during a test flight in March 2023.\n\nThe X-62A subsequently completed 21 test flights out of Edwards Air Force Base\nin California across three separate test windows in support of ACE between\nDecember 2022 and September 2023. During those flight tests, there was nearly\ndaily reprogramming of the \"agents,\" with over 100,000 lines of code\nultimately changed in some way. AFRL has previously highlighted the ability to\nfurther support this kind of flight testing through the rapid training and\nretraining of algorithms in entirely digital environments.\n\nThen, in September 2023, \"we actually took the X-62 and flew it against a live\nmanned F-16,\" Air Force Lt. Col. Maryann Karlen, the Deputy Commandant of the\nUSAF TPS, says in the newly released video. \"We built up in safety [with]...\nthe maneuvers, first defensive, then offensive then high-aspect nose-to-nose\nengagements where we got as close as 2,000 feet at 1,200 miles per hour.\"\n\nA screengrab from the newly released ACE video showing a visual representation\nof the X-62A and the F-16 merging during the mock dogfight, with a view from\nthe VISTA jet's cockpit seen in the inset at lower right. DARPA/USAF capture\n\nAdditional testing using the X-62A in support of ACE has continued into this\nyear and is still ongoing.\n\nThe X-62A's safely conducting dogfighting maneuvers autonomously in relation\nto another crewed aircraft is a major milestone not just for ACE, but for\nautonomous flight in general. However, DARPA and the Air Force stress that\nwhile dogfighting was the centerpiece of this testing, what ACE is aiming for\nreally goes beyond that specific context.\n\n\"It's very easy to look at the X-62/ACE program and see it as 'under\nautonomous control, it can dogfight.' That misses the point,\" Bill \"Evil\"\nGray, the USAF TPS' chief test pilot, says in the newly released video.\n\"Dogfighting was the problem to solve so we could start testing autonomous\nartificial intelligence systems in the air. ...every lesson we're learning\napplies to every task you can give to an autonomous system.\"\n\nAnother view from the X-62A's cockpit during last year's mock dogfight.\nDARPA/USAF capture\n\nGray's comments are in line with what Brandon Tseng, Shield AI's co-founder,\npresident, and chief growth officer, told The War Zone in an interview earlier\nthis month:\n\n\"I tell people that self-driving technology for aircraft enables mission\nexecution, with no remote pilot, no communications, and no GPS. It enables the\nconcept of teaming or swarming where these aircraft can execute the\ncommander's intent. They can execute a mission, working together dynamically,\nreading and reacting to each other, to the battlefield, to the adversarial\nthreats, and to civilians on the ground.\"\n\n...\n\n\"The other value proposition I think of is the system \u2013 the fleet of aircraft\nalways gets better. You always have the best AI pilot on an aircraft at any\ngiven time. We win 99.9% of engagements with our fighter jet AI pilot, and\nthat's the worst that it will ever be, which is superhuman. So when you talk\nabout fleet learning, that will be on every single aircraft, you will always\nhave the best quadcopter pilot, you'll always have the best V-BAT pilot,\nyou'll always have the best CCA pilot, you name it. It'll be dominant. You\ndon't want the second best AI pilot or the third best, because it truly\nmatters that you're winning these engagements at incredibly high rates.\"\n\nShield AI\n\nThere are still challenges. The new ACE video provides two very helpful\ndefinitions of autonomy capability in aerospace development right at the\nbeginning to help in understanding the complexity of the work being done\nthrough the program.\n\nThe first is so-called rules-based autonomy, which \"is very powerful under the\nright conditions. You write out rules in an 'if-then' kind of a way, and these\nrules have to be robust,\" Dr. Daniela Rus from the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology's (MIT) Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory\n(CSAIL), one of ACE's academic partners, explains at one point. \"You need a\ngroup of experts who can generate the code to make the system work.\"\n\nHistorically, when people discuss autonomy in relation to military and\ncivilian aerospace programs, as well as other applications, this has been the\nkind of autonomy they are talking about.\n\n\"The machine learning approach relies on analyzing historical data to make\ninformed decisions for both present and future situations, often discovering\ninsights that are imperceptible to humans or challenging to express through\nconventional rule-based languages,\" Dr. Rus adds. \"Machine learning is\nextraordinarily powerful in environments and situations where conditions\nfluctuate dynamically making it difficult to establish clear and robust\nrules.\"\n\nEnabling a pilot-optional aircraft like the X-62A to dogfight against a real\nhuman opponent who is making unknowable independent decisions is exactly the\n\"environments and situations\" being referred to here. Mock engagements like\nthis can be very dangerous even for the most highly trained pilots given their\nunpredictability.\n\nA screengrab from the newly released ACE video the data about mishaps and\nfatalities incurred during dogfight training involving F-16 and F/A-18\nfighters between 2000 and 2016. DARPA/USAF capture\n\n\"The flip side of that coin is the challenge\" of many elements involved when\nusing artificial intelligence machine learning being \"not fully\nunderstandable,\" Air Force Col. James Valpiani, the USAF TPS commandant, says\nin the new ACE video.\n\n\"Understandability and verification are holding us back from exploring that\nspace,\" he adds. \"There is not currently a civil or military pathway to\ncertify machine learning agents for flight critical systems.\"\n\nAccording to DARPA and the Air Force, this is really where ACE and the real-\nworld X-62A test flights come into play. One of the major elements of the\nAI/machine learning \"agents\" on the VISTA jet is a set of \"safety trips\" that\nare designed to prevent the aircraft from performing both dangerous and\nunethical actions. This includes code to define allowable flight envelopes and\nto help avoid collisions, either in midair or with the ground, as well as do\nthings like prevent weapons use in authorized scenarios.\n\nThe U.S. military insists that a human will always be somewhere in the loop in\nthe operation of future autonomous weapon systems, but where exactly they are\nin that loop is expected to evolve over time and has already been the subject\nof much debate. Just earlier this month, The War Zone explored these and other\nrelated issues in depth in a feature you can find here.\n\n\"We have to be able to trust these algorithms to use them in a real-world\nsetting,\" the ACE program manager says.\n\n\"While the X-62's unique safety features have been instrumental in allowing us\nto take elevated technical risks with these machine learning agents, in this\ntest campaign, there were no violations of the training rules, which codify\nthe airman safety and ethical norms, demonstrating the potential that machine\nlearning has for future aerospace applications,\" another speaker, who is not\nreadily identifiable, adds toward the end of the newly released video.\n\nTrust in the ACE algorithms is set to be put to a significant test later this\nyear when Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall gets into the cockpit for a\ntest flight.\n\n\"I\u2019m going to take a ride in an autonomously flown F-16 later this year,\"\nKendall said at a hearing before members of the Senate Appropriations\nCommittee last week. \"There will be a pilot with me who will just be watching,\nas I will be, as the autonomous technology works, and hopefully, neither he\nnor I will be needed to fly the airplane.\"\n\nKendall has previously named ACE as one of several tangential efforts feeding\ndirectly into his service's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drone program.\nThe CCA program is seeking to acquire hundreds, if not thousands of lower-cost\ndrones with high degrees of autonomy. These uncrewed aircraft will operate\nvery closely with crewed types, including a new stealthy sixth-generation\ncombat jet being developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD)\ninitiative, primarily in the air-to-air role, at least initially. You can read\nmore about the Air Force's CCA effort here. The U.S. Navy also has a separate\nCCA program, which is closely intertwined with that of the Air Force and\nsignificant new details about which were recently disclosed.\n\nIt is important to note that the X-62A is not the only aircraft the Air Force\nhas been using to support advanced autonomy developments in recent years\noutside of the ACE program. The service is now in the process of transforming\nsix more F-16s into test jets to support larger-scale collaborative autonomy\ntesting as part of another program called Project VENOM (Viper Experimentation\nand Next-Gen Operations Mode).\n\nOne of the first F-16s set to be converted into an autonomy testbed under\nProject VENOM arrives at Eglin Air Force Base on April 1, 2024. USAF\n\nIn addition, as already noted, the underlying technology being developed under\nACE could have very broad applications. There is great interest across the\nU.S. military in new AI and machine learning-enabled autonomous capabilities\nin general. Potential adversaries and global competitors, especially China,\nare also actively pursuing developments in this field. In particular, the\nChinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) is reportedly working on projects with\nsimilar, if not identical aims to ACE and the AlphaDogfight Trials. This could\nall have impacts on the commercial aviation sector, as well.\n\n\"What the X-62/CE team has done is really a paradigm shift,\" USAF commandant\nValpiani says at the end of the newly released video. \"We've fundamentally\nchanged the conversation by showing this can be done safely and responsibly,\nand so now we've created a pathway for others to follow in building machine\nlearning applications for air and space.\"\n\nMore details about the use of the X-62A in support of ACE are already set to\nbe revealed later this week and it will be exciting to learn more about what\nthe program has achieved.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com\n\nAir ForcesAmericasAround The GlobeArtificial IntelligenceF-16FightersU.S. Air\nForceU.S. Homeland\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
