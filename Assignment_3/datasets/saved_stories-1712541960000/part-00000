It is built upon the well-\nestablished GObject Introspection framework for language bindings.\n\n## Features\n\n  * Idiomatic C#: An API which feels natural to C# developers (including the async/await feature).\n  * Simplicity: Memory management is handled automatically, greatly simplifying the C-API.\n  * Complete API: Support for the entire GTK and GStreamer stack, enabling feature-rich applications which deeply integrate with the OS.\n  * Extensibility: Allows 3rd party developers to write bindings for other GObject-based libraries, achieving full interoperability between them.\n\n## Status\n\nThe code is under development and not ready for production use. There are\nnuget packages available. The API is subject to change as long as version 1.0\nis not released. Feel free to visit the nuget organization to get an overview.\n\nThe upcoming features and releases can be checked out in the milestones.\n\n## Supported Libraries\n\nLibrary| Description| Level of Support  \n---|---|---  \nGTK-4.0| UI-Toolkit| Partial  \nLibadwaita-1| Building blocks for modern GNOME applications| Partial  \nGStreamer-1.0| Multimedia Framework| Partial  \nCairo-1.0| Graphics Library| Partial  \nPango-1.0| Font/Text Library| Partial  \nGio-2.0| Library for high level application functionality| Partial  \nGdkPixbuf-2.0| Image loading in various formats| Partial  \nlibshumate| Library to display maps| Planned  \nWebKit-6.0| Browser engine (Linux only)| Partial  \nJavaScriptCore-6.0| JavaScript engine for WebKit (Linux only)| Partial  \nGtkSource-5| Extends a Gtk.TextView to be like a source code editor| Partial  \n  \n## Get Involved\n\nAnyone who wants to help is very welcome. If you want to get in contact feel\nfree to chat with us via matrix (#gircore:matrix.org) or open a discussion and\ndon't forget to check out our contribution guidelines.\n\n## Build\n\nTo generate the bindings locally execute the following commands in a terminal.\nMake sure to initialise submodules with --recursive otherwise the gir-files\ndirectory will not be loaded properly.\n\n    \n    \n    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/gircore/gir.core.git $ cd gir.core/src $ dotnet fsi GenerateLibs.fsx $ dotnet build GirCore.Libs.slnf\n\nIf you want to clean the Libs folder of all generated files run:\n\n    \n    \n    $ dotnet fsi CleanLibs.fsx\n\nFor more advanced build options, see the documentation.\n\n## Code structure\n\nThe folder structure in this repository is organized as follows:\n\n  * src/Generation/GirTool: The tool to generate the bindings.\n  * src/Generation/GirLoader: A library for reading and resolving GObject Introspection repositories.\n  * src/Generation/GirModel: An interface based definition of the GObject data model. Used by the loader and generator to have a common understanding of the GObject data model.\n  * src/Generation/Generator: Code generator generates C# code from GObject Introspection data.\n  * src/Extensions/Integration: Optional source generators to reduce boilerplate code in your projects.\n  * src/Libs: Contains manually written code for libraries. The generator outputs code here.\n  * src/Samples: Example programs using GTK, GStreamer, and others.\n  * src/Extensions: Auxilary libraries which extend the core libraries.\n  * src/Tests: Unit and Integration tests.\n  * ext/gir-files: Introspection data from gircore/gir-files.\n\nThe code in the library folder is not complete because most of the code is\ngenerated when the GirTool is run.\n\n## Licensing terms\n\nGir.Core is licensed under the terms of the MIT-License.
