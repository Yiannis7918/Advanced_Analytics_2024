As software\u2019s gotten easier to build (and flooded\nby ample venture dollars), competition has skyrocketed in almost every market.\nThe deluge of me-too products has made it hard for buyers and founders to tell\nthe difference. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there's major opportunity remaining in\nsoftware. But it might come in a different package.\n\nServices businesses are a promising next frontier. With massive market sizes-\nthe Big 4 alone brought in $200B in revenue last year- and a relative dearth\nof dynamic tech talent, the ground is fertile. Historically, common wisdom has\nheld \u201cservices businesses aren\u2019t venture backable.\u201d Compared to software\nbusinesses, services performed by humans tend to be low margin, hard to scale\nexponentially, lumpy in revenue, etc. etc. There are many cautionary tales.\nBut change is afoot... hastened by AI, cracking open new, huge opportunities\nfor founders brave enough to go against the tired wisdom.\n\nWe even have a beacon out there showing the way: Palantir. What started as a\nservices business is now amongst the most highly-valued (on a multiples basis)\nventure-backed company in the industry. There\u2019s much to be learned from its\nmarch to higher margins and recurring revenue. And with the rapid advancement\nof AI, I\u2019d argue we\u2019re on the verge of a Cambrian explosion of Palantirs.\n\nService businesses that leverage both AI and humans to deliver holistic\nsolutions to clients are poised to outgun and outpace the services behemoths\nthat\u2019ve dominated for the last 50 years. Legacy providers are ripe for\ndisruption: their business models rely on human labor and hourly billing which\ncan be turned on its head by AI-enabled vendors. Further, their \u201cproduct\u201d\n(humans) is very difficult to integrate AI into. While software incumbents are\nhaving a relatively easy time adapting to the GenAI wave, services incumbents\nwill struggle. Founders, this is a boomtown moment to seize.\n\nFor a long time now, founders pursuing software exclusively have been strip\nmining for the same, highly competitive gold.\n\nThere\u2019s a bounty to be had by the few companies building disruptive AI-enabled\nservices. Think this:\n\nWe want to help by sharing the potential we\u2019re seeing out there. We\u2019ll delve\ninto which types of services are ripest for disruption, and go into detail on\nhow startups can modify their approaches to product, GTM, and more to build\nthe strongest companies possible in the space.\n\n### These are the services most ready for change\n\nService firms are hired for two reasons:\n\n  * Do a job that the client doesn\u2019t have the bandwidth or expertise to do.\n  * Offer third-party expertise in decisions (cynically, to cover the client\u2019s a**.)\n\nThat execution-oriented first bucket tends to include IT implementations (like\ncloud migration projects), financial audits, and outsourced customer support \u2013\nthings clients want a services firm to do for them.\n\nThe second more advisory bucket is home to M&A banking services, strategy\nconsulting, and wealth management \u2013 things clients want a services firm to\nhelp them with.\n\nWe think AI-enabled services businesses can thrive in that first bucket.\nStartups have the chance to combine humans and software to handle those \u201cdo it\nfor me\u201d tasks that can be easily automated and have objective outcomes.\n\nThe more advisory-focused a project is, the less a client will trust a bot.\nThe better opportunity for startups in this category is to play more of an\nenabler role- selling AI-enabled software to help existing service providers.\nThere\u2019s some golden opportunities here too \u2013 think of the software that could\nbe sold to law firms, banks, Deloitte itself (!) to help them do more with\nless.\n\nSo we\u2019ve got the \u201cHelp you do it vs. do it for you\u201d dichotomy. The other big\none is \u201crepeatable vs. bespoke.\u201d The more repeatable a service, the more\nproductizable. The more productizable, the better the startup opportunity.\n\nWe used these two spectrums to build a framework that makes it clear where we\nsee the best opportunities to capture services market share.\n\nDisruptors reading this today, look to that top right quadrant. Those are the\nlow-hanging, productizable fruit.\n\nOne bonus consideration: It\u2019s worth studying the services that have high\nfailure rates and been difficult to perform in the past. Can AI do much\nbetter? Then it\u2019s worth pursuing.\n\nFor example, we just invested in a company called Mechanical Orchard that uses\nAI to move data trapped inside clunky mainframes to the cloud. This was not\njust hard \u2013 it was often impossible \u2013 to do before. The code was just too old,\nbroken, and dense with no way to map it. 50% of migration projects driven by\nservices firms failed. Mechanical Orchard saw this and put AI to work, teasing\nthis code apart, and making it safe and secure to move.\n\nThe way we see it, services startups going after execution-oriented,\nrepetitious tasks are going to out-deliver the competition to scale quickly\nand efficiently\u2013 and that\u2019s very venture-backable.\n\n### How to build one of these companies\n\nThese hybrid companies \u2013 part AI-enabled software, part people \u2013 don\u2019t have a\nlot of precedent. There are a lot of open questions: Can AI-enabled solutions\nperform well enough? How to build a trusted brand when clients are already\nskeptical? Do you hire the same types of people or not?\n\nWe\u2019ve aggregated what we\u2019ve learned alongside the early leaders in the space,\nlike Mechanical Orchard and Harvey. But we\u2019re all definitely in learning mode,\nso we\u2019d love to hear your perspectives.\n\nHere are the emerging best practices we\u2019ve seen:\n\n#### Product\n\n  * Fewer jobs-to-be-done. Focus on just 1-2 jobs-to-be done that are shared by many clients. The more jobs, the harder to productize. You can always expand.\n  * Scalable access. Find and tap into high-quality talent channels. Mechanical Orchard did this with the Pivotal Labs network (CEO Rob Mee used to run that company). Where\u2019s your leg up?\n  * Piggyback software. Focus on those opportunities where you can sell software alongside services. AI will widen margins by improving service delivery, but true software sales will anchor repeatable revenue.\n\n#### GTM\n\n  * Believable brand. Services firms are often hired based on relationships and reputation. Startup founders need to invest in building the same.\n  * Product marketing FTW. It\u2019s on these marketers to figure out what customers really want and need, and translate that into messaging that slam dunks the value of AI for the client. Speed? Cost savings? Whatever it is, it has to be punched hard.\n  * Befriend your frenemies. Be strategic in how you navigate the existing ecosystem of services firms \u2013 they\u2019ve been around for a while and some of them may be great channel partners if you can help them solve a challenge for their clients that they aren\u2019t equipped to.\n  * Outcome-based pricing. Charging for the value your work unlocks instead of for the inputs (like labor) allows you to capture more value beyond what you put in (like what the AI does...) This might not be feasible before you demonstrate value, but you can move to it over time.\n\n#### Org Design\n\n  * Hybrid humans. The new worker this trend creates will have skills on both the client side and the product side. When devs aren\u2019t on client work at Mechanical Orchard, they\u2019re building internal software. The versatility helps tighten the product feedback loop.\n  * Honed metrics. Your metric tracking needs to be bulletproof from the beginning, both for GAAP accounting purposes and for operational decision making.\n  * Aligned incentives. Each team\u2019s incentives need to be aligned with evolving staffing and pricing models. You want to reward folks for building more versatile skill sets and selling services and product that produce great outcomes.\n\nWe\u2019ll add to this list and host events that dig deeper into what\u2019s changing\nacross organizations (and people\u2019s skill sets) as AI takes root in new ways.\nIf you\u2019ve observed any of this, or other best practices, we\u2019d love to hear\nfrom you.\n\n### Blurring the line between something and someone\n\nWhile the software industry has come to consume the world, it\u2019s important to\nremember that software is just a means to an end. As Clay Christensen reminds\nus, buyers really just want to make a hire that gets the job done well \u2014\nwhether that\u2019s hiring someone or something.\n\nWhile software and services firms have evolved as separate entities, it would\nbe easier for a buyer to have a single vendor to hold responsible. And as AI\nblurs the line between that \u201csomething\u201d and \u201csomeone,\u201d the era of the full-\nservice startup may well be upon us.\n\nThe implications of this are both simple and predictable, and potentially wild\nand far flung. On the very likely to happen side of the spectrum, it stands to\nreason that if companies can do a whole job-to-be-done (instead of capping out\nbecause they only focus on software OR services), they\u2019ll be able to extend\ntheir TAM further than ever and capture more value. We\u2019re already seeing this\nunderway.\n\nOn the wilder end, just think \u2013 what if a full job-to-be-done firm enabled\ncompanies to outsource everything except their core competency. For example, a\nfirm could presumably handle all of your go-to-market from marketing to sales,\ncustomer experience to success, in which case you could focus solely on\nbuilding and refining your core product. If this was real, how much faster\nwould technology move? It\u2019s fun to think about.\n\nBringing it back to the present, we\u2019re excited to track the burgeoning crop of\ncompanies exploring new combinations of software and services with the help of\nAI \u2014 as well as the ripple effects created by this big shift. If you\u2019re\nbuilding something that fits these descriptions, we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nSend us a note anytime at jsaper@emcap.com or jessica@emcap.com.\n\n## Enjoying this article?\n\nSign up to gain access to our thought leadership and have future articles\ndelivered directly to your email.\n\n### Want to stay up to date with our team?
