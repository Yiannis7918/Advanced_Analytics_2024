The combination of a\nhigh quality product, efficient fuel consumption, and a low price tag made\nthese brands very popular in the US and Europe in the aftermath of the 1970s\noil shock, resulting in a decline in market share for domestic manufacturers\nand complaints of unfair competition from entrepreneurs and trade unions.\n\nThe \u201cJapan Shock\u201d soon engendered a protectionist policy response. The US and\nthe UK negotiated voluntary import quotas with Japan to limit competitive\npressure on their car industries, and European countries adopted similar\nmeasures. But this was only the first step in a deeper transformation of\nWestern industry. Desperately seeking avenues to regain international\ncompetitiveness and quell heightening domestic labor unrest, companies in the\nglobal automotive sector and beyond began to emulate their Japanese rivals.\nThe \u201cToyota method,\u201d expounded by the company\u2019s leading industrial engineer\nTaiichi Ohno, became a must-read for any serious industrial manager, while\nNorth Atlantic business schools started teaching Kaizen and Kanban methods of\n\u201cjust-in-time\u201d production. This cultural shift, sometimes described as part of\na broader process of \u201cJapanization,\u201d served to catalyze the embrace of what\nsociologists came to call post-Fordist management strategies, which focused on\nflexibility and cost-cutting while rejecting the vertically integrated\nproduction models of 1950s US and European auto leaders.\n\nNearly fifty years after the \u201cJapan shock,\u201d today\u2019s global automotive industry\nconfronts a far more systemic upheaval\u2014what we could term the \u201cChinese\nelectric vehicle (EV) shock.\u201d Until recently, China\u2019s automotive industry was\ndismissed as a low-quality copy of Western or Japanese models. However, it has\nsince achieved impressive quality and price competitiveness in the strategic\nsection of electric vehicles\u2014in 2023, the Chinese giant BYD overtook Tesla as\nthe largest producer of electric cars with 3 million New Energy Vehicles\n(NEVs).^1 That year, China\u2019s export of NEVs grew by 64 percent. Together with\ngood Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) sales and Russian demand induced by\nWestern sanctions, China has already overcome Japan as the world\u2019s largest\nauto exporter overall.\n\nFigure 1: EV quarterly sales (2018\u20132023)\n\nHow Western governments will respond to competition in an industry long\nconsidered the test of economic prowess is a question of central concern to\nthe twenty-first century. In both the US and EU, the rise of Chinese EVs has\nbeen condemned as the result of unfair practices. Announcing a probe into\nChinese EVs and state aid in September, Ursula Von der Leyen asserted that\ntheir competitiveness was a result of \u201cmarket manipulation.\u201d Joe Biden has\nsimilarly pledged to prevent Chinese EVS from \u201cflood[ing] our market,\u201d and\nDonald Trump described the impact of Chinese electric cars as an economic\n\u201cbloodbath.\u201d\n\nUnderlying these incendiary remarks, however, is an industrial transformation\nno less significant than that of Japanese automakers in the 1980s. The rise of\nthe Chinese EV industry has been enabled not only by generous government\nsubsidies but also by profound changes in strategy and organization, and in\nparticular by a distinctive revival of vertical integration\u2014at both individual\nfirm and national levels. The approach is perfectly exemplified by BYD, which\nhas sought to bring virtually all aspects of the value chain under its\ncontrol: from battery technology\u2014which was its initial core business\u2014to\nmicrochips and even expanding to ownership of lithium mines and car carrier\nships. Further, exploiting significantly lower labor costs in China compared\nto countries like Japan, Germany and the US, the firm has availed itself of a\nmassive army of factory workers with a significantly more labor-intensive\nproduction process than its competitors. This neo-Fordist approach has allowed\nBYD to drive down costs while coordinating and accelerating the innovation of\ndifferent key components during a pivotal phase in the industry\u2019s evolution.\nAdditionally, it has enabled the company to mitigate operational uncertainties\nand address shortages of various input factors and services, like the ongoing\nchip shortage since 2020.\n\nIn parallel, the Chinese government has been pushing for vertical integration\nat the national level, ensuring that 80 percent of the EV value chain is\ncontained within the country through the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan, which has\nthe aim of minimizing the effects of disruptions and setting the conditions to\nreinforce and maintain technological supremacy. While the model is likely to\nshift as labor relations evolve, this turn towards \u201cre-integration\u201d and \u201cre-\ninternalization\u201d carries important lessons about the future of economic\norganization and industrial policy.\n\n### The electric vehicle revolution\n\nAmerican management theorist Peter Drucker famously called the automotive\nindustry the \u201cindustry of industries\u201d\u2014for over a century, car manufacturing\nhas represented the ultimate test of industrial development due to the\ncomplexity of input factors, range of supplementary industries, and high\ncapital and knowledge requirements. Cars depend on mining, chemical, steel,\nand electronics sectors, armies of technicians and production workers, and\nexpensive machinery and plants. Car production has enormous barriers to entry\nand involves major entrepreneurial risks; this is why relatively few countries\ncan claim membership in the exclusive club of auto-manufacturing. These\nchallenges are even more pronounced with electric vehicles.\n\nLike other green technologies, such as solar panels, electric vehicles are not\nentirely new. At the turn of the twentieth century, some of the first\nautomobiles were powered by primordial lead-acid batteries; a third of the\ncars in 1900 New York were electric. But at the time, gasoline-powered\nvehicles outperformed electric ones due to their higher range and speed as\nwell as their lower operating costs thanks to cheap and abundant oil. This\nbalance has dramatically changed in recent years. Besides boasting sportier\nperformance (contrary to popular perceptions), EVs offer lower operating\ncosts, lower maintenance and repair costs, greater convenience in daily use,\nand less noise. The savings in operating costs are particularly impressive,\nwith recharging EVs projected to \u201creduce the energy costs of a vehicle by\n50\u201280 percent through 2030 relative to a comparable gasoline vehicle.\u201d Of\ncourse, as technology and infrastructure develop, significant disadvantages\nremain in higher up-front costs, a limited range, long charging times, and, in\nmany countries, the scarcity of recharging points.\n\nElectric batteries are what economists specializing in innovation would\ndescribe as the \u201cenabling technology\u201d of EVs, but they are also their\nstructural bottleneck. The lithium-ion battery (LIB) invented in 1991 offered\na smaller and more capable substitute for its nickel-cadmium predecessor to\npower all sorts of battery-powered products that were previously unthinkable:\nfrom smartphones to tablets, robot vacuum cleaners, and the so-called \u201cmicro-\nmobility\u201d of electric bikes and scooters. However, its application to\nautomotives promises to have the most revolutionary consequences. Since the\ninvention of LIB, their energy density has increased threefold while the cost\nper kilowatt-hour has dropped by more than 90 percent. Thus, the same\ntechnology that in the 1990s backed Nokia and Motorola phones can now power\ncars and even buses. Moreover, improvements via the lithium-iron-phosphate\n(LFP) variant, already used by BYD for its blade batteries, and a shift in LIB\nfrom liquid to solid electrolytes, could significantly increase capacity and\nprovide faster charging.\n\nThe centrality of battery technology to the EV sector also explains the\nimportance attributed to the construction of so-called \u201cgiga\nfactories\u201d\u2014enormous manufacturing plants that can produce batteries whose\ntotal storage is billions of watt-hours\u2014and why access to lithium has now\nbecome so strategic. This alkaline metal is not scarce on the earth\u2019s crust.\nHowever, only a few places around the world enjoy a degree of concentration\nsufficient to make the extraction of lithium economically viable, with Chile,\nArgentina, and Australia being the most endowed nations. To guarantee\nthemselves security of supply, some EV companies are now entering the lithium\nmining business directly, either as shareholders or sole owners.\n\n### The new Henry Ford\n\nThe rise of the Chinese automotive industry has generated an estimated 140\ndifferent EV brands, but only a few of them are on the same order of magnitude\nas BYD, which in 2023 surpassed Tesla as the largest EV producer in the world.\nThe firm was founded in Shenzhen in 1995 by Wang Chuanfu, an orphan from the\npoor rural region of Anhui who studied chemistry and material science. In many\nways, the company\u2019s operations closely resemble an electric revival of the\nFordist logic of mass production, with a highly labor-intensive production\nprocess, a vast army of factory workers, and Taylorist methods of scientific\norganization of production.\n\nAbove all, BYD echoes the Fordist emphasis on vertical integration. Just as\nFord acquired iron and coal mines to produce steel; rubber plantations in\nBrazil to produce tires (before the invention of vulcanization eliminated the\nneed for natural rubber); white silica sand mines to churn out the car\u2019s\nwindscreens, windows, and mirrors; and even forests to build the car\u2019s wooden\nparts, BYD has moved to control the production and assembly of battery cells;\nthe manufacturing of the electric powertrain; the semiconductors and\nelectronic modules; and now even the mining of lithium. It also builds its\ncars\u2019 axles, transmission, cockpits, brakes, and suspensions \u201cin-house.\u201d And,\njust like the Fordist giant plants of Highland Park and River Rouge, BYD has\nbuilt enormous industrial plants to produce batteries and other critical\ncomponents, and for the assembly of cars. Four of them are located in BYD\u2019s\nhometown, Shenzen, and twenty elsewhere around China, while several new plants\nare currently being built abroad, from Hungary to Brazil.\n\nIn the first part of twentieth century, vertical integration enabled Ford and\nother firms to reduce intermediation costs, control production, and coordinate\ninnovation across different stages of manufacturing, from the procurement of\nrubber and steel to the standardization of parts and suppliers. High\nproductivity and high wages in an oligopolistic market secured stable profits\nin an expansionary macroeconomic environment, i.e. the golden era of Fordism,\nbetween the end of World War II and the end of the 1960s. The oil crisis of\nthe 1970s revealed the rigidity of this industrial model, as wage inflation\nand demand for more efficient vehicles made US automakers uncompetitive.\nWestern industrialists then took inspiration from just-in-time flexible\nmanufacturing achieved by Japanese firms like Toyota, which relied on a\nnetwork of external suppliers and contingent labor to absorb market shocks,\nspinning off the production of components. Japanese car makers broke the\nassembly line into islands of production manned by quality teams, co-opting\nunions into corporate objectives. This business organization logic was\nconducive to a more efficient disciplining of the workforce and the\ndisorganization of trade unions, whose bargaining power collapsed when they\ncould no longer threaten work stoppages across stages of production.\n\nOutsourcing went hand in hand with offshoring much of the value chain to\ncountries with lower wage costs. Economist Raph\u00e4el Chiappini argued, \u201cSince\nthe end of the 1980s, carmakers in Europe, Japan and the US, such as General\nMotors, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen, Audi and Daimler Chrysler, have\noutsourced an increasing share of automotive production to emerging countries\nto benefit from lower production costs.\u201d This has led to an \u201cinternational\ndivision of labor\u201d or, more negatively put, \u201cinternational fragmentation,\u201d\nnamely a situation in which various countries specialize in distinct stages of\nthe supply chain where they accrue a competitive advantage. While intending to\nimprove quality and reduce costs, this shift has also made car manufacturers\nvulnerable to supply chain disruption, which is becoming a growing risk in\nthese unstable times.\n\n### The return of vertical integration\n\nThe weaknesses of global supply chains have become ever more apparent in the\naftermath of the pandemic and within the context of heightened security\ncompetition. As a result, the language of \u201conshoring\u201d and \u201cin-house\u201d has crept\ninto policy debates. In this regard, BYD presents a fascinating example of the\ncontemporary \u201cre-internalization\u201d of national production and its relationship\nto the broader drift of new industrial policies. The firm follows the typical\nstructure of the vertically integrated conglomerate, with the central company\n(BYD Company) controlling various subsidiaries: BYD Auto, BYD Electronics, BYD\nSemiconductors, BYD Transit Solutions, and BYD FinDreams (the arm responsible\nfor producing batteries and various car components). While vertical\nintegration is common to other EV competitors such as Tesla, BYD has achieved\na far greater degree of integration than Musk\u2019s firm, which purchases around\n90 percent of its batteries from firms such as Panasonic and CATL.\n\nBattery production was BYD\u2019s original core activity, ensuring high competency\nin the production of the most critical and potentially innovative component of\nEVs. Through its subsidiary BYD Semiconductors, the company also controls the\nproduction of microchips, which proved an important advantage during the\npost-2020 microchip shortage resulting from the trade war between China and\nthe US. Chuanfu\u2019s company also produces its own metal and plastic parts, has\nbought shares in China\u2019s leading lithium miner Shengxin Lithium Group, and is\nshopping for mines in Brazil. BYD has thus achieved unparalleled control over\nits production cycle\u2014according to the firm, only the tires and windows are\nentirely outsourced. A report by the New York Times highlighted that, in the\nmanufacturing of the hatchback Sedan Seal, BYD produces internally a whopping\nthree-quarters of all components\u2014compared to just one-third for a comparable\nVolkswagen electric car, giving it a 35 percent cost lead.\n\nBYD is also increasingly active in the \u201cdownstream\u201d part of the car industry,\nnamely sales and service. It has recently entered the shipping sector with BYD\nExplorer 1, a Ro-Ro vessel able to transport 5,000 cars, which is expected to\nbe the first of an expanding fleet, guaranteeing BYD better control of the\ndelivery of its products. Like the Fordist model, BYD\u2019s vertically integrated\nstrategy is labor intensive. The company\u2019s employees have doubled in just two\nyears, reaching 570,000 workers in 2023 (just under Volkswagen\u2019s 670,000 and\nsignificantly above Toyota\u2019s 370,000). Bucking the Japanese model of highly\nautomated production involving expensive machinery, BYD has instead long\nrelied on comparatively cheap manual workers performing a myriad of small\ntasks. Such lower \u201ccapital intensity\u201d has thus far proven an excellent recipe\nfor expanding revenues and profits\u2014but this may change as labor costs rise due\nto competition between automotive companies.\n\nFigure 2: Total assets and the number of employees of major automakers (2023)\n\n### Learning from China\u2019s industrial policy\n\nBYD\u2019s success, however, is the product of sustained industrial policy. Though\nits longstanding efforts to achieve \u201cintensive development\u201d in the automotive\nindustry had repeatedly ended in disappointments, eventually, China has been\nable to exploit what Alexander Gerschenkron called the \u201cadvantage of\nbackwardness.\u201d Taking lessons from other East Asian countries like Japan and\nKorea, China has pursued developmental state policies to move from low-end to\nhigh-end manufacturing, with \u201cgreen technologies\u201d assigned particular\nimportance.\n\nNew energy vehicles first earned a policy mention in the tenth Five Year Plan\n(2001\u20132005). However, it was only in the aftermath of the 2007\u20132008 financial\ncrisis that they \u201cwere designated as a strategic emerging industry, along with\nsolar and wind power.\u201d An important turning point in industrial policy for EVs\nwas the launch in 2015 of the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan announced by Xi\nJinping and Prime Minister Li Keqiang. The plan declared that \u201cmanufacturing\nis the core of the national economy, the root on which the country is\nestablished, the tool for national invigoration, and the foundation for a\nstrong country.\u201d EVs featured among ten key sectors seen as pivotal for the\ncountry\u2019s future success, besides integrated circuits, aerospace equipment and\nnew materials. Notably, the plan recommended that 80 percent of all necessary\ninput factors for the EV industry be sourced in China to guarantee a high\ndegree of \u201cindependence\u201d in the production of EVs. This push for domestic\nsourcing enormously shaped the production strategies carried out by domestic\nfirms.\n\nChina now finds itself in a place of seemingly unassailable supremacy in this\nindustry: 60 percent of all EVs produced in 2023 were made in China.\nFurthermore, Chinese firms have a formidable cost advantage over legacy\ncompetitors, estimated at around 25 percent for BYD, according to Swiss Bank\nUBS. Like all countries, China must import some raw materials, especially\nlithium carbonate from Chile and Argentina and cobalt from Congo. But it also\ncontrols key elements of the supply of critical materials: over half of the\nLithium world production, over 60 percent of Cobalt production, and 70 percent\nof rare earth materials. Furthermore, the Chinese industry accounts for over\n70 percent of the cell components of batteries and the production of battery\ncells. Two-thirds of global battery production is located in China, with CATL\nand BYD accounting for over 50 percent of the global output. This push to\ndevelop an independent and largely self-sufficient value chain has proven far-\nsighted in anticipating the disruptions faced by global supply chains because\nof extreme weather, war, and growing inter-power rivalry. A high share of the\nEV value chain gives China a significant comparative advantage vis-\u00e0-vis\ncompetitors while also providing the conditions to defend the supremacy in\ninnovation and intellectual property that China is likely to achieve in coming\nyears.\n\nThe Chinese government promoted these developments through generous science\nand technology funding, such as with the famous 863 Program. Under the tenure\nof automotive engineer Wan Gang (2007\u20132018), the Ministry of Science and\nTechnology has been strongly supportive of the EV sector. Through joint\nventures like SAIC-Volkswagen and acquisitions of Western car suppliers, the\nChinese government pursued technology transfers from foreign companies. It\nalso offered grants or loans to car firms for, among other things, the\ncreation of manufacturing plants and bankruptcy prevention. The key policy\ninstrument, however, has come in the form of subsidies.\n\nIt is estimated that the Chinese government spent $60 billion in subsidies on\nelectric vehicles between 2009 and 2017. Consumer subsidies have been more\ngenerous than the $7,500 tax credit offered by Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction\nAct, with national tax credits compounded by local government tax credits. The\ntwenty-three local authorities (nineteen provinces and four metropolitan\nareas) are responsible for around 70 percent of public spending. These local\ngovernments conduct their industrial policy by championing local producers\nthrough grants, cheap credit, bailouts, and land supply, and by targeting\nprocurement on local enterprises (for example, by sourcing the local taxi\nfleet with cars from the local automotive company).\n\nAdditionally, Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) include many automotive\nfirms. Centrally owned SOEs are coordinated through the State-owned Assets\nSupervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) and are\nexpected to contribute to the implementation of government objectives. Some\nautomotive SOEs such as SAIC, BAIC, and Chery are instead owned by provincial\nauthorities, which are known for supporting loss-making industries to protect\njobs and manufacturing capacity.\n\nPolitical support for \u201clocal champions\u201d by provincial authorities, combined\nwith stimulus interventions from the central government, is known to lead to\nstructural overcapacity, as was the case of the steel-making sector in the\nmid-2010s when the central government was eventually forced to impose closures\nand consolidation. While overcapacity can be seen as economically wasteful, it\nengenders a Darwinian struggle for entrepreneurial survival and technological\ninnovation, which nurtures internationally competitive export champions. This\nis what is now in store for the EV sector, which is affected by severe\nfragmentation. The incipient price war will become fiercer as subsidies are\nprogressively scaled back and domestic demand in China continues to be weak.\nHowever, offering the eventual winners greater economies of scale, this moment\nof reckoning is likely to make Chinese EVs even more competitive\ninternationally.\n\nThe embrace of state-guided industrial policy and vertically integrated\nproduction by BYD and the Chinese government more broadly reflect a\nremarkable, if nascent, tendency within the global economy. While this\ntendency is echoed in Biden\u2019s subsidy-fueled industrial turn, the EU still\nclings to a post-Fordist vision and to a nostalgic hope to revive\nglobalization and its long supply chains. The ongoing EU investigation on\nChinese EVs will likely recommend a hike in import tariffs, which are\ncurrently a third of US tariffs at a modest 9 percent. In March 2024, the EU\nstarted registering Chinese EVs at customs, meaning these tariffs could be\napplied retroactively. Import tariffs will offer little solace, however,\nwithout a deeper reflection on the changing structure of global production.\nWestern countries should realize that in many sectors such as EVs, they\nare\u2014for the first time in modern history\u2014in a technological catch-up mode vis-\na-vis a more advanced competitor, which they also consider a key geopolitical\nrival. Instead of focusing their attention on increasing military spending and\ndrumming up fears of global war, Western countries ought to take China\u2019s\ntechnological and industrial challenge seriously.\n\n  1.
