This\nis actually an innovative approach to solving for an efficient shop aid,\"\nSpirit spokesperson Joe Buccino told The Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Buccino, Spirit also tried using other household products such as\nVaseline, cornstarch, and talcum powder as a lubricant before settling on\nliquid Dawn soap.\n\nBuccino said the Dawn soap became their top choice because it didn't cause the\ndoor seal to degrade over time.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSpirit told The Times that Boeing had approved both practices. The company\nadded that the soap and the key card-like device were documented for use under\nFAA's standards as factory tools, also known as shop aids.\n\nThe company's chief technology officer, Sean Black, told The Times that Spirit\ncame up with the key card-like device after seeing workers using a hotel key\ncard to check gaps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Our workers routinely find creative ways to make the process of building\nfuselages more efficient. In this case, workers created the door rigger seal\ntool, which allows our teams to test the door seals without any risk of\ndegrading the seal over time,\" Black told the outlet.\n\nA spokesperson for Boeing confirmed to The Times that it had indeed approved\nSpirit's use of the soap and key card-like device, while an FAA representative\ndeclined The Times' request for comment.\n\nThe audit, the FAA said, was part of its ongoing investigation into Boeing\nafter a door plug on an Alaska Airlines flight blew out in January while the\nplane was still midair.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Spirit's unorthodox engineering practices takes\nplace amid heightened scrutiny of the quality of Boeing's planes. The aircraft\nmanufacturer has come under the spotlight following repeated quality assurance\nlapses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said\nin a Senate hearing that she was considering surveying every Boeing employee\nabout the company's safety culture.\n\n\"I don't think there's anyone at Boeing, from Dave Calhoun down, that doesn't\nwant to know what happened. They want to know, and they want to fix it, and\nwe're there to help,\" NTSB chief Jennifer Homendy said.\n\nRepresentatives for Boeing, Spirit, and the FAA did not immediately respond to\na request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business\nhours.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: 5 cleanings that keep the travel industry running\n\nBoeing Boeing 737 Max\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
