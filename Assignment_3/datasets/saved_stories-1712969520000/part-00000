I admit, I\u2019ve\nhad this article in my backlog for months, always reluctant to publish it,\nthinking I\u2019d just be repeating the obvious; if you think about it, this\nreluctance is a sign of the impostor phenomenon itself.\n\nIn reality, before writing this article, I wanted to collect enough\ninformation and reflect on how I\u2019ve experienced it to share my unique point of\nview and, as I always try to do, offer practical advice on how to deal with\nit.\n\nSo, with this in mind, today we are going to explore Impostor Syndrome in all\nits facets, and precisely:\n\n  * \ud83d\udcad What Impostor Syndrome is\n\n  * \ud83e\udde0 Some psychological concepts related to this emotional phenomenon\n\n  * \ud83e\udda0 How Impostor Syndrome affects engineering environments\n\n  * \ud83e\udd4a How to fight this feeling\n\nAs always, we have a lot to cover, so let\u2019s begin!\n\n##\n\n\ud83d\udcad What is the Impostor Syndrome?\n\nThe first thing I want to clarify is that, despite its name, impostor syndrome\nis not a clinical syndrome or a psychiatric disorder.\n\nSo, while it\u2019s commonly referred to as a syndrome, and for convenience, I will\nuse this term throughout this article, keep this in mind.\n\nImpostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon in which individuals doubt\ntheir accomplishments and persistently fear being exposed as \"frauds\" despite\nexternal evidence of their competence.\n\nThe term was first coined by psychologists Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A.\nImes in 1978 when they observed this phenomenon in high-achieving women. Since\nthen, research has shown that impostor syndrome can affect anyone, regardless\nof gender, job status, or level of success.\n\nThough not a recognized disorder, impostor syndrome can significantly impact\nan individual\u2019s mental health, leading to anxiety, low self-esteem,\ndepression, and stress.\n\n###\n\nDunning Kruger Bias and Impostor Phenomenon\n\nAnother way I find useful to understand the impostor phenomenon is to compare\nit with the well-known Dunning Kruger effect.\n\nThe Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias where individuals with low\nability in a particular area overestimate their own competence. So, in some\nway, it\u2019s the opposite of what happens with the impostor phenomenon.\n\nOn the other hand, this effect also notes that highly competent individuals\nmight underestimate their relative competence, assuming that tasks that are\neasy for them are also easy for others.\n\n  * Dunning Kruger Effect: shows that individuals with lower actual competence tend to overestimate their abilities (overconfidence), peaking in confidence at lower levels of competence. This confidence starts going down when they gain competence and this often leads to feeling impostors.\n\n  * Impostor Syndrome: shows that as competence increases, individuals experiencing impostor phenomenon tend to underestimate their abilities (underconfidence), with the lowest perceived competence occurring at higher levels of actual competence.\n\n###\n\nCauses of Impostor Syndrome\n\nImpostor Syndrome is a complex phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors.\nNo single cause has been pinpointed; rather, it is believed to emerge from a\ncombination of personality traits and situational triggers.\n\nHere are some of the primary causes associated with the impostor phenomenon:\n\n  * \ud83c\udfe0 Family Dynamics: high expectations and criticism coming from education.\n\n  * \ud83e\udde0 Personality Traits: perfectionism, lack of self-awareness, and anxiety.\n\n  * \ud83c\udf0d Cultural Factors: cultural background and societal expectations.\n\n  * \ud83c\udfe2 Workplace Environment: competitive environments with high expectations.\n\n  * \ud83c\udfc6 Early Successes/Failures: pressure from early successes or lingering doubts from failures.\n\n  * \ud83d\udcca Peer Comparisons: comparisons with peers amplified by social media.\n\n###\n\n5 Types of Impostors\n\nImpostor phenomenon can manifest in various ways and affects individuals\nacross different professions, life stages, and personal backgrounds.\n\nDr. Valerie Young, an expert on Impostor Syndrome, has identified five\ndistinct \"faces\" or types of Impostor Syndrome, each with its own set of\ncharacteristics and origins.\n\nThese are the five types:\n\n  * \ud83c\udfaf The Perfectionist\n\n    * Characteristics: sets exceptionally high standards and considers even minor mistakes as failures.\n\n    * Origin: comes from environments where excellence is heavily rewarded or demanded, leading to a belief that perfection is essential.\n\n  * \ud83d\udcaa The Superhero\n\n    * Characteristics: strives to work harder and longer than peers to prove worthiness, needing to excel in every aspect of life.\n\n    * Origin: stems from a deep-seated belief of inadequacy, compensating by overachieving.\n\n  * \ud83e\udde0 The Natural Genius\n\n    * Characteristics: expects to master tasks effortlessly; feels fraudulent when having to spend significant effort.\n\n    * Origin: often praised for innate intelligence rather than effort, leading to shame when facing challenges.\n\n  * \ud83d\udeb6\u2642\ufe0f The Soloist\n\n    * Characteristics: prefers to tackle tasks independently; views seeking help as a sign of weakness or fraudulence.\n\n    * Origin: raised in environments that prize self-reliance as a measure of competence.\n\n  * \ud83d\udcda The Expert\n\n    * Characteristics: has an insatiable need to know every detail before starting projects; fears being perceived as inexperienced.\n\n    * Origin: emerges from settings that highly emphasize knowledge and expertise, fostering a belief that one can never be knowledgeable enough.\n\nIn my career journey, I've worn different masks at different stages, and\nhere's what I observed:\n\n  * As an individual contributor, I was deep into perfectionism, felt like a natural genius, and often played the expert role.\n\n  * When I stepped up to manager or leader, I took on the soloist role and sometimes felt like a superhero.\n\n##\n\n\ud83e\udda0 How Impostor Phenomenon Affects Engineering Environments\n\nAs we've already mentioned, the impostor phenomenon can affect anyone.\n\nHowever, I firmly believe that the IT engineering environment is particularly\nfertile ground for this psychological pattern.\n\nHere are a few reasons why:\n\n  * \ud83d\udcbb Rapid Technological Changes: constant updates and new technologies make it hard to feel like an expert.\n\n  * \ud83d\ude80 High Expectations: the push for innovation and breakthrough solutions fuels self-doubt.\n\n  * \ud83e\udde9 Complexity and Specialization: the depth of specialization in IT can isolate professionals, making self-assessment difficult.\n\n  * \ud83d\udcca Comparative Performance: visibility on platforms and networks leads to constant comparison with peers.\n\n  * \ud83c\udf10 Diverse Workforce: working with a global team can intensify feelings of inadequacy.\n\nIt should be noted that tech companies\u2014and consequently engineers\u2014tend to be\nmore public with their accomplishments and challenges.\n\nThis transparency results in a wealth of \"literature\" coming from our sector,\nwhich may amplify the perception that the impostor phenomenon is more\nprevalent in engineering.\n\n###\n\nFeeling an Impostor with Career Advancement\n\nAnother interesting thing that I noticed, which might sound counterintuitive,\nis that the further you progress in your engineering career, the more likely\nyou will experience the impostor phenomenon.\n\nThis is especially true for those advancing into management or leadership\nroles.\n\nThere are two main reasons for this:\n\n  * \ud83d\udcc8 Increased Responsibility: as you advance in your career in engineering, you'll face greater responsibilities, which can amplify doubts about your abilities.\n\n  * \ud83d\udcc9 Less Tangible Work: transitioning from an individual contributor to a management or leadership role means your work becomes less tangible. Based on my experience, this shift is a significant trigger for the impostor phenomenon.\n\n##\n\n\ud83e\udd4a How to Fight Impostor Phenomenon\n\nAs the saying goes, \u201cbeing aware of the problem is half the solution\u201d, and\nthis is particularly true for the impostor phenomenon. As we've mentioned,\nalthough it's called syndrome, it technically isn't one.\n\n###\n\nSelf-Awareness\n\nSelf-awareness in general is probably the best weapon you have to fight\nimpostor phenomenon and something you should train to thrive in your career.\n\nThese are my main suggestions to train your self-awareness:\n\n  * \ud83e\udd14 Reflect: reserve some time every day to think about yourself. This practice can help you notice patterns in your thoughts and behaviors, which becomes crucial in identifying impostor patterns.\n\n  * \ud83c\udf3f Time alone: spend time alone without distractions. Use this time to think, feel, and be with yourself, exploring your inner world.\n\n  * \ud83d\udce3 Seek Feedback: actively seek constructive feedback from peers and friends. Understanding how others perceive you can provide valuable insights into your behaviors and social interactions.\n\n  * \ud83c\udf0d Try new things: stepping out of your comfort zone by trying new activities, hobbies, or roles can reveal aspects of your character and capabilities that you might not have been aware of before.\n\n###\n\nJournaling\n\nThe second best weapon you have to fight impostor phenomenon, which definitely\nmade a big difference in my career, is journaling. This was crucial for me\nwhen I transitioned from an individual contributor to a manager/leadership\nrole.\n\nAs we've seen, when you move into these roles, what was once tangible work and\nimpact becomes less tangible.\n\n  * \u270d\ufe0f What you achieved: write down your daily achievements. Ten minutes per day are enough; you don\u2019t need to write books. Over time, this will help you visualize the amount of things you have achieved and assist in preventing feelings an impostor.\n\n  * \ud83c\udfaf Your goals: writing down your yearly, monthly, and even weekly goals helps you understand if you are making progress. This, again, is very effective in preventing the feeling that you are doing nothing.\n\n  * \u2764\ufe0f Your feelings: Writing about how you feel can help you identify patterns in your emotional responses to different situations. Recognizing these patterns can provide insights into triggers for your impostor feelings and help you develop strategies to manage them more effectively.\n\n###\n\nDon\u2019t go Alone\n\nAs we've observed, impostors often feel like superheroes or geniuses and tend\nto go it alone. Therefore, one of the best ways to combat this phenomenon is\nto surround yourself with people you trust and seek their help.\n\n  * \ud83e\udd1d Show Vulnerability: admitting you don't have all the answers can be powerful. When you show vulnerability, you open yourself up to support from others and reduce the pressure to appear perfect.\n\n  * \ud83d\udc65 Think as a Team: don\u2019t try to tackle everythign alone, seek your team\u2019s support instead. Collaborative efforts not only enhance results but also distribute the stress and diminish feelings of being an impostor.\n\n  * \ud83e\udde0 Seek Coaching: a coach or mentor can provide perspective, encouragement, and actionable advice. Their experience can help you navigate doubts and foster personal and professional growth.\n\n###\n\nOne more thing...\n\nWhen you advance to higher leadership roles, such as that of an Engineering\nDirector or VP of Engineering, your work will become even less tangible, and\nat times, you might find yourself without practical tasks to complete.\n\nEverything is going well: your teams are performing great, and management is\nhappy with your achievements, but you might feel as if you are doing nothing,\nleading you to feel like an impostor.\n\nI\u2019ve been there, and sometimes this feeling comes back.\n\nRepeat with me:\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fine to have nothing specific to do\u201d\n\nJust make sure to use this time wisely.\n\nTake a course, read this newsletter (\ud83e\udd13), write down your thoughts, be\nproactive and start new initiatives, or sometimes, just take some rest!\n\nYour mental health is your team\u2019s health.\n\n##\n\n\u270c\ufe0f That\u2019s all folks\n\nThat's all for today!

My\nexperiences aligned completely there. The only caveat I was naive when I\nstarted and felt like an imposter, but I started off by trying to hide it\nhard! But as I grew in my role, I became more vocal imposter and admitting my\nshortcomings openly.I think to add to your final point \"Don't go alone\",\nbuilding a solid support system is something I've found very useful dealing\nwith this, to be fair you said this thing too.Another thing I found\nparticularly helpful was to find a superhero, a person that you look up to and\ncan get in touch with. For me, this was our VP, but it can CXOs or your guru.\nWhen they shared their imposter syndrome story, it always calmed me down.Great\npost, Nicola, really enjoyed it!Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Nicola Ballotta\n\nDavid Z Joseph4 hrs agoAbsolutely brilliant; ThxExpand full\ncommentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 more comment...\n\nShould you Stay Technical as an Engineering Manager?\n\nNavigating the Balance Between Engineering Management and Technical Expertise\n\nFeb 8 \u2022\n\nNicola Ballotta\n\n97\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Should you Stay Technical as an Engineering Manager?\n\nhybridhacker.email\n\n14\n\nEngineer's Guide to LinkedIn\n\nA simple guide for Engineers and Leaders on how to leverage LinkedIn for\nCareer Growth\n\nFeb 15 \u2022\n\nNicola Ballotta\n\n118\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Engineer's Guide to LinkedIn\n\nhybridhacker.email\n\n26\n\nWhat is a Staff Engineer?\n\nDiving into the Staff Engineer Role, with Raviraj from Meta\n\nNov 23, 2023 \u2022\n\nNicola Ballotta\n\nand\n\nRaviraj Achar\n\n99\n\nShare this post\n\n#### What is a Staff Engineer?\n\nhybridhacker.email\n\n14\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Nicola Ballotta\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
