In museum archives,\nresearchers found photos of remains from Paleolithic children who had belonged\nto a group of early Homo sapiens in Eurasia.\n\nBy Christian Tryon and Shara Bailey\n\n3 Apr 2024\n\nAn illustration stored in museum archives indicates pieces of Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil 1\n(the most complete child\u2019s skull) that were found (white) or reconstructed\nbased on measurements (yellow).\n\nGift of Nancy Movius, 1998. Courtesy of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and\nEthnology, Harvard University, 998-27-40/14628.1.63\n\n> Please note that this article includes images of human remains.\n\n## ANOTHER SET OF TEETH\n\n\u201cThese teeth don\u2019t belong to Egbert!\u201d\n\nIn a museum basement, we huddled over a black-and-white photograph showing\npieces of a lower jawbone and its loose teeth. The photo captured evidence of\na missing child\u2014one who had been buried 40,000 years ago, only to be\ndiscovered and then lost by archaeologists.\n\nThis long-lost child, represented only by a lower jaw, was referred to as Ks\u00e2r\n\u2018Akil 4 because it was the fourth human fossil discovered at the site of Ks\u00e2r\n\u2018Akil in Lebanon, on the Eastern Mediterranean coast.\n\nArchaeologists found the remains alongside another fossil called Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil 1,\nwhich included parts of a skull. Perhaps because this other skull was more\ncomplete, this individual was given a nickname: \u201cEgbert.\u201d Like Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil 4,\nEgbert, too, was a now-missing, fossil child. The two children belonged to a\npopulation of early Homo sapiens that spread into Eurasia around the time\nNeanderthals went extinct. Their remains and the artifacts found with them\nshed light on this major turning point in human evolution.\n\nBefore Egbert went missing, scientists cast a copy of the child\u2019s skull,\nallowing future researchers to study it. No such cast was made of Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil\n4. Its existence was merely noted as \u201canother set of teeth\u201d found next to\nEgbert in early publications.\n\nFig 1 / 3\n\nPhotos from the Peabody Museum show aspects of the Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil research,\nincluding excavation trenches and the removal of fossils in cement.\n\nGift of Nancy Movius, 1998.

Courtesy of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and\nEthnology, Harvard University, 998-27-40/14628.1.27.\n\nKs\u00e2r \u2018Akil 4 remained unknown to researchers until 2019 when we\u2014an\narchaeologist and a biological anthropologist\u2014found a photograph of those\nteeth within towers of carboard boxes of documents from the Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil\nexcavations. From the photo, we learned new details about this pivotal\npopulation\u2014a discovery that highlights the importance of archival research and\nthe seemingly mundane paper trail that should accompany any anthropological\nfieldwork.\n\n## FOUND AND LOST\n\nIn 1937, American Jesuit priests launched excavations at Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil. They dug\na trench as deep as two city busses stacked end-to-end that yielded millions\nof artifacts and food remains. In personal letters written in November 1938,\nproject biological anthropologist Father J. Franklin Ewing discussed a pair of\nchild burials emerging from about halfway down the excavation.\n\nWith World War II looming, the team had to seal the remains of Egbert and Ks\u00e2r\n\u2018Akil 4 in concrete and leave. Japanese forces intercepted Ewing on his way\nhome to the U.S. via the Philippines. He became a prisoner of war, losing many\nrecords of those initial excavations at Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil.\n\nAfter the war, Ewing retrieved the concrete-encased human burials from Lebanon\nand shipped them to a museum at Harvard University for careful excavation.\nHere the evidence from the archives is murky, but it appears that only\nEgbert\u2019s skull and the teeth of Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil 4 were successfully extracted. Like\nthe notes and photographs of the early excavations, the other fossils and\nartifacts once encased in the concrete block are now lost.\n\nA Peabody Museum photograph shows fossils as they emerged from the ground\nduring excavations at Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil.\n\nGift of Nancy Movius, 1998. Courtesy of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and\nEthnology, Harvard University, 998-27-40/14628.1.55.\n\nEwing\u2019s reconstruction of Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil 1 is shown in this Peabody Museum\nphotograph.\n\nGift of Nancy Movius, 1998. Courtesy of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and\nEthnology, Harvard University, 998-27-40/14628.1.59.\n\nEwing never published a detailed description of Egbert\u2019s remains. But he was\nthe one to craft a reconstruction of Egbert\u2019s skull before the material was\nlost. He used large amounts of modeling clay to make \u201cbest guesses\u201d about its\noriginal form. In the late 1980s, other researchers formally described\nEgbert\u2019s skull based on a cast of this reconstruction, but nothing was done\nabout the second child.\n\nNo one knows where the physical remains of either Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil child ended up.\nEwing claimed he shipped the fossils back to Lebanon in the 1950s or 1960s.\nIt\u2019s unclear if they ever arrived.\n\n## UPPER PALEOLITHIC CHILDREN\n\nAlthough just children, and only fragments of them at that, the fossils from\nKs\u00e2r \u2018Akil matter. The artifacts found with them attest to cultural and\ntechnological changes, known as the Upper Paleolithic, that swept through the\nMediterranean region and other parts of Eurasia around 40,000 years ago, just\nabout the time Neanderthals disappeared.\n\nThe technological innovations include long-range weapons like the bow and\narrow, and expanded diets that could have fed larger populations. Cultural\nchanges at Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil and other Upper Paleolithic sites show that these humans\nalso used innovative forms of visual expression. They painted with red and\nyellow ochre, crafted beads from animal teeth and seashells, and at Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil\naccessed exotic stones from up to 700 kilometers away in what is today central\nTurkey.\n\n> Although just children, and only fragments of them at that, the fossils from\n> Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil matter.\n\nThese changes associated with Upper Paleolithic cultures likely accrued\npiecemeal from behaviors gradually developed in Africa or Arabia. Their\nseemingly sudden appearance as a package in Europe and the Mediterranean could\nbe the result of newcomers with the technologies migrating to the regions. Or\nperhaps these novel ideas spread among societies already in place.\n\nBut most Paleolithic sites only yield stone tools and other artifacts. No\nfossils to indicate who made the items.\n\nExceptionally, Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil is one of few sites in the Mediterranean in which\nearly Upper Paleolithic artifacts have been found with human remains. Such\nsites are critical in demonstrating that, whatever the mechanism of their\nspread, the people responsible for these Upper Paleolithic technologies were\nH. sapiens\u2014not Neanderthals or some other extinct hominin group.\n\n## PHOTOS OF MISSING PEOPLE\n\nThe finds from Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil interested us both. Bailey is a dental\nanthropologist who pioneered methods of distinguishing the teeth of H. sapiens\nand Neanderthals. Tryon, a Paleolithic archaeologist, studies artifacts and\nsediments from ancient human sites.\n\nTens of thousands of stone tools from Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil had been sitting for decades,\nmostly unstudied, in wooden boxes in Harvard University\u2019s Peabody Museum of\nArchaeology and Ethnography. Tryon was eager to start analyzing the stone\ntools with colleague Laure Metz (who correctly suspected some of the tiniest\nones were used as arrow tips). But first, he decided to inspect the notes,\npapers, letters, and photographs that documented the site.\n\nAmong those papers, Tryon found a series of photographs and X-ray images of\nhuman remains and reached out to Bailey to help make sense of them. Some of\nthe photos showed pieces of jaws held together with clay; others showed\nvarious fragments apart. We assumed the photographs were of the same\nteeth\u2014Egbert\u2019s teeth\u2014before and after reconstruction with clay.\n\nLooking closer, Bailey noticed discrepancies between the subtle ridges and\nvalleys of the isolated teeth and those in the clay-fortified jaws.\n\n\u201cThese teeth don\u2019t belong to Egbert!\u201d she exclaimed. Although the jaws with\nclay were Egbert, the isolated teeth must have come from Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil 4.\n\nThe images allowed us to provide the first scientific description of Ks\u00e2r\n\u2018Akil 4. Among other insights, we determined the child was around 8 years old.\nFrom the photos and X-rays, we also learned more about Egbert. We confirmed\nthe kid was also around 8 and made a detailed study of the shape of Egbert\u2019s\nteeth, which had been impossible from the casts alone.\n\nX-rays of the child\u2019s teeth (Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil 1) allowed the authors to identify\ndental traits that may be unique to this ancient population of H. sapiens.\n\nGift of Nancy Movius, 1998. Courtesy of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and\nEthnology, Harvard University, 998-27-40/14628.1.57\n\nWhy the two lost children were buried we will never know. But from the details\nof their teeth observed from photographs taken more than 70 years ago, we can\nidentify both as belonging to our species, H. sapiens.\n\nAt the same time, they exhibit some unusual dental details. Nearly all fossil\nand most living people have five cusps on their lower first permanent molars\n(a.k.a. \u201cschool teeth\u201d because they emerge around 6 years of age). But only\nfour cusps graced the molars of the lost children from Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil.\n\nThese sorts of dental differences may be markers of a particular ancient\npopulation. Scholars trace these physical markers in people\u2019s bodies across\ntime and space like a trail of breadcrumbs left by ancient groups on the move.\nKnowing this cusp marker may aid future research on folks some 40,000 years\nago\u2014as populations migrated out of Africa, into Africa, or across Eurasia.\n\n## EXCAVATIONS IN THE ARCHIVES\n\nBeyond what we learned about the Ks\u00e2r \u2018Akil youngsters, our experience\ndemonstrates the importance of archival research. It highlights the value of a\ncareful second look at documents, photographs, and materials from excavations\nthat took place decades ago, and the important role museums and archivists\nplay in conserving these records.\n\nSurveys in sun-dappled landscapes and subterranean digs done by lamplight can\nbe thrilling. Naturally, they capture our imaginations. But field research\nunfortunately tends to favor people with certain degrees of wealth, privilege,\nand ability. Archival research can be more accessible\u2014and just as\nilluminating. We have much to learn from the papers left by yesterday\u2019s\nscholars.\n\nChristian Tryon\n\nChristian Tryon is a Paleolithic archaeologist who studies the archaeology of\nthe origin and dispersal of Homo sapiens. Most of his work focuses on the\nMediterranean region and eastern Africa, and he is particularly interested in\nstone tools, geological approaches to the human past, biogeography, and the\nuse of museums and archives. He received his Ph.D. from the University of\nConnecticut, where he is a professor of anthropology and the department head.\nTryon is also a research associate in the Human Origins Program at the\nSmithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of Natural History and in the\nanthropology department at Harvard University. His current field project\ninvestigates early human occupation of what is today Sicily, Italy, and his\narchival research centers around rockshelters in Tanzania and Uganda.\n\nShara Bailey\n\nShara Bailey is a biological anthropologist who uses teeth to answer questions\nabout human evolution. While her primary focus has been on Neanderthals and\nmodern human origins, she applies her methods to hominin dental remains of any\nage. Her recent work includes analysis of 2.8-million-year-old teeth from\nNyayanga, East Africa, and the teeth of Homo naledi, Homo floresiensis, and\nDenisovans. Bailey received her Ph.D. from the Institute of Human Origins at\nArizona State University. She is a professor in the department of anthropology\nand the director of the Center for the Study of Human Origins at New York\nUniversity. Her research has been featured on National Public Radio, the\nHistory Channel, National Geographic, and PBS/Nova.\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\n### Stay connected\n\n#### Find us on\n\nFacebook, Instagram, Threads, Twitter, Mastodon, Flipboard\n\n#### Share\n\n, Facebook, Twitter, Email, ,\n\nSuggestions for You\n\nessay / Snapshot\n\n### The Birth of the \u201cNeanderthals\u201d\n\nPaige Madison\n\nLibrary archives reveal the Gibraltar skull\u2019s role in the discovery of our\nsister species.\n\nessay / Snapshot\n\n### Stone Points to a Connected World\n\nRosemary Joyce\n\nSigns of 19th-century globalization surface in a museum storage room.\n\ncolumn / Curiosities\n\n### A Relic of the Past Soars Into the Final Frontier\n\nStephen E.
