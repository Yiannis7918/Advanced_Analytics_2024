Subsequent documents have demonstrated a\nfinancial arrangement between the NSA's Special Source Operations (SSO)\ndivision and PRISM partners in the millions of dollars.^[14]\n\nDocuments indicate that PRISM is \"the number one source of raw intelligence\nused for NSA analytic reports\", and it accounts for 91% of the NSA's internet\ntraffic acquired under FISA section 702 authority.\"^[15]^[16] The leaked\ninformation came after the revelation that the FISA Court had been ordering a\nsubsidiary of telecommunications company Verizon Communications to turn over\nlogs tracking all of its customers' telephone calls to the NSA.^[17]^[18]\n\nU.S. government officials have disputed criticisms of PRISM in the Guardian\nand Washington Post articles and have defended the program, asserting that it\ncannot be used on domestic targets without a warrant. Additionally claiming\nthe program has helped to prevent acts of terrorism, and that it receives\nindependent oversight from the federal government's executive, judicial and\nlegislative branches.^[19]^[20] On June 19, 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama,\nduring a visit to Germany, stated that the NSA's data gathering practices\nconstitute \"a circumscribed, narrow system directed at us being able to\nprotect our people.\"^[21]\n\n## Media disclosure of PRISM[edit]\n\nFurther information: Global surveillance disclosure\n\nEdward Snowden publicly revealed the existence of PRISM through a series of\nclassified documents leaked to journalists of The Washington Post and The\nGuardian while Snowden, who was an NSA contractor at the time, was visiting\nHong Kong.^[1]^[2] The leaked documents included 41 PowerPoint slides, four of\nwhich were published in news articles.^[1]^[2]\n\nThe documents identified several technology companies as participants in the\nPRISM program, including Microsoft in 2007, Yahoo! in 2008, Google in 2009,\nFacebook in 2009, Paltalk in 2009, YouTube in 2010, AOL in 2011, Skype in 2011\nand Apple in 2012.^[22] The speaker's notes in the briefing document reviewed\nby The Washington Post indicated that \"98 percent of PRISM production is based\non Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft\".^[1]\n\nThe slide presentation stated that much of the world's electronic\ncommunications pass through the U.S., because electronic communications data\ntend to follow the least expensive route rather than the most physically\ndirect route, and the bulk of the world's internet infrastructure is based in\nthe United States.^[15] The presentation noted that these facts provide United\nStates intelligence analysts with opportunities for intercepting the\ncommunications of foreign targets as their electronic data pass into or\nthrough the United States.^[2]^[15]\n\nSnowden's subsequent disclosures included statements that government agencies\nsuch as the United Kingdom's GCHQ also undertook mass interception and\ntracking of internet and communications data^[23] \u2013 described by Germany as\n\"nightmarish\" if true^[24] \u2013 allegations that the NSA engaged in \"dangerous\"\nand \"criminal\" activity by \"hacking\" civilian infrastructure networks in other\ncountries such as \"universities, hospitals, and private businesses\",^[13] and\nalleged that compliance offered only very limited restrictive effect on mass\ndata collection practices (including of Americans) since restrictions \"are\npolicy-based, not technically based, and can change at any time\", adding that\n\"Additionally, audits are cursory, incomplete, and easily fooled by fake\njustifications\",^[13] with numerous self-granted exceptions, and that NSA\npolicies encourage staff to assume the benefit of the doubt in cases of\nuncertainty.^[25]^[26]^[27]\n\n### The slides[edit]\n\nBelow are a number of slides released by Edward Snowden showing the operation\nand processes behind the PRISM program.

Bush Administration but was\nwidely criticized and challenged as illegal, because it did not include\nwarrants obtained from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nCourt.^[32]^[33]^[34]^[35]^[36] PRISM was authorized by the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court.^[15]\n\nPRISM was enabled under President Bush by the Protect America Act of 2007 and\nby the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which immunizes private companies from\nlegal action when they cooperate with U.S. government agencies in intelligence\ncollection. In 2012 the act was renewed by Congress under President Obama for\nan additional five years, through December 2017.^[2]^[37]^[38] According to\nThe Register, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 \"specifically authorizes\nintelligence agencies to monitor the phone, email, and other communications of\nU.S. citizens for up to a week without obtaining a warrant\" when one of the\nparties is outside the U.S.^[37]\n\nThe most detailed description of the PRISM program can be found in a report\nabout NSA's collection efforts under Section 702 FAA, that was released by the\nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) on July 2, 2014.^[39]\n\nAccording to this report, PRISM is only used to collect internet\ncommunications, not telephone conversations. These internet communications are\nnot collected in bulk, but in a targeted way: only communications that are to\nor from specific selectors, like e-mail addresses, can be gathered. Under\nPRISM, there's no collection based on keywords or names.^[39]\n\nThe actual collection process is done by the Data Intercept Technology Unit\n(DITU) of the FBI, which on behalf of the NSA sends the selectors to the U.S.\ninternet service providers, which were previously served with a Section 702\nDirective. Under this directive, the provider is legally obliged to hand over\n(to DITU) all communications to or from the selectors provided by the\ngovernment.^[39] DITU then sends these communications to NSA, where they are\nstored in various databases, depending on their type.\n\nData, both content and metadata, that already have been collected under the\nPRISM program, may be searched for both US and non-US person identifiers.\nThese kinds of queries became known as \"back-door searches\" and are conducted\nby NSA, FBI and CIA.^[40] Each of these agencies has slightly different\nprotocols and safeguards to protect searches with a US person identifier.^[39]\n\n### Extent of the program[edit]\n\nInternal NSA presentation slides included in the various media disclosures\nshow that the NSA could unilaterally access data and perform \"extensive, in-\ndepth surveillance on live communications and stored information\" with\nexamples including email, video and voice chat, videos, photos, voice-over-IP\nchats (such as Skype), file transfers, and social networking details.^[2]\nSnowden summarized that \"in general, the reality is this: if an NSA, FBI, CIA,\nDIA, etc. analyst has access to query raw SIGINT [signals intelligence]\ndatabases, they can enter and get results for anything they want.\"^[13]\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the intelligence analysts search PRISM data\nusing terms intended to identify suspicious communications of targets whom the\nanalysts suspect with at least 51 percent confidence to not be U.S. citizens,\nbut in the process, communication data of some U.S. citizens are also\ncollected unintentionally.^[1] Training materials for analysts tell them that\nwhile they should periodically report such accidental collection of non-\nforeign U.S. data, \"it's nothing to worry about.\"^[1]^[41]\n\nAccording to The Guardian, NSA had access to chats and emails on Hotmail.com\nand Skype because Microsoft had \"developed a surveillance capability to deal\"\nwith the interception of chats, and \"for Prism collection against Microsoft\nemail services will be unaffected because Prism collects this data prior to\nencryption.\"^[42]^[43]\n\nAlso according to The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald even low-level NSA analysts\nare allowed to search and listen to the communications of Americans and other\npeople without court approval and supervision. Greenwald said low level\nAnalysts can, via systems like PRISM, \"listen to whatever emails they want,\nwhatever telephone calls, browsing histories, Microsoft Word documents.^[31]\nAnd it's all done with no need to go to a court, with no need to even get\nsupervisor approval on the part of the analyst.\"^[44]\n\nHe added that the NSA databank, with its years of collected communications,\nallows analysts to search that database and listen \"to the calls or read the\nemails of everything that the NSA has stored, or look at the browsing\nhistories or Google search terms that you've entered, and it also alerts them\nto any further activity that people connected to that email address or that IP\naddress do in the future.\"^[44] Greenwald was referring in the context of the\nforegoing quotes to the NSA program XKeyscore.^[45]\n\n### PRISM overview[edit]\n\nDesignation| Legal Authority^See Note| Key Targets| Type of Information\ncollected| Associated Databases| Associated Software  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nUS-984XN| Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act (FAA)| Known Targets\ninclude^[46]\n\n  * Venezuela\n    * Military procurement\n    * Oil\n  * Mexico\n    * Narcotics\n    * Energy\n    * Internal Security\n    * Political Affairs\n  * Colombia\n    * Trafficking\n    * FARC\n\n| The exact type of data varies by provider:\n\n  * Email\n  * Chat \u2013 video, voice\n  * Videos\n  * Stored data\n  * VoIP\n  * File transfers\n  * Video Conferencing\n  * Notifications of target activity, logins, etc.\n  * Online Social Networking details\n  * Special Requests\n\n| Known:\n\n  * TRAFFICTHIEF\n  * MARINA\n  * MAINWAY\n  * FALLOUT\n  * PINWALE\n  * CONVEYANCE\n  * NUCLEON\n\n| Known:Unified Targeting Tool  \n  \n## Responses to disclosures[edit]\n\n### United States government[edit]\n\n#### Executive branch life[edit]\n\nShortly after publication of the reports by The Guardian and The Washington\nPost, the United States Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, on\nJune 7, 2013, released a statement confirming that for nearly six years the\ngovernment of the United States had been using large internet services\ncompanies such as Facebook to collect information on foreigners outside the\nUnited States as a defense against national security threats.^[17] The\nstatement read in part, \"The Guardian and The Washington Post articles refer\nto collection of communications pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act. They contain numerous inaccuracies.\"^[47] He\nwent on to say, \"Section 702 is a provision of FISA that is designed to\nfacilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning\nnon-U.S. persons located outside the United States. It cannot be used to\nintentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person, or anyone\nlocated within the United States.\"^[47] Clapper concluded his statement by\nstating, \"The unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and\nentirely legal program is reprehensible and risks important protections for\nthe security of Americans.\"^[47] On March 12, 2013, Clapper had told the\nUnited States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the NSA does \"not\nwittingly\" collect any type of data on millions or hundreds of millions of\nAmericans.^[48] Clapper later admitted the statement he made on March 12,\n2013, was a lie,^[49] or in his words \"I responded in what I thought was the\nmost truthful, or least untruthful manner by saying no.\"^[50]\n\nOn June 7, 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama, referring to the PRISM\nprogram^[51] and the NSA's telephone calls logging program, said, \"What you've\ngot is two programs that were originally authorized by Congress, have been\nrepeatedly authorized by Congress. Bipartisan majorities have approved them.\nCongress is continually briefed on how these are conducted. There are a whole\nrange of safeguards involved. And federal judges are overseeing the entire\nprogram throughout.\"^[52] He also said, \"You can't have 100 percent security\nand then also have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. You know, we're\ngoing to have to make some choices as a society.\"^[52] In separate statements,\nsenior Obama administration officials (not mentioned by name in source) said\nthat Congress had been briefed 13 times on the programs since 2009.^[53]\n\nOn June 8, 2013, Director of National Intelligence Clapper made an additional\npublic statement about PRISM and released a fact sheet providing further\ninformation about the program, which he described as \"an internal government\ncomputer system used to facilitate the government's statutorily authorized\ncollection of foreign intelligence information from electronic communication\nservice providers under court supervision, as authorized by Section 702 of the\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) (50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1881a).\"^[54]^[55]\nThe fact sheet stated that \"the surveillance activities published in The\nGuardian and the Washington Post are lawful and conducted under authorities\nwidely known and discussed, and fully debated and authorized by\nCongress.\"^[54] The fact sheet also stated that \"the United States Government\ndoes not unilaterally obtain information from the servers of U.S. electronic\ncommunication service providers. All such information is obtained with FISA\nCourt approval and with the knowledge of the provider based on a written\ndirective from the Attorney General and the Director of National\nIntelligence.\" It said that the attorney general provides FISA Court rulings\nand semi-annual reports about PRISM activities to Congress, \"provid[ing] an\nunprecedented degree of accountability and transparency.\"^[54] Democratic\nsenators Udall and Wyden, who serve on the U.S. Senate Select Committee on\nIntelligence, subsequently criticized the fact sheet as being\ninaccurate.^[clarification needed] NSA Director General Keith Alexander\nacknowledged the errors, stating that the fact sheet \"could have more\nprecisely described\" the requirements governing the collection of e-mail and\nother internet content from US companies. The fact sheet was withdrawn from\nthe NSA's website around June 26.^[56]\n\nIn a closed-doors Senate hearing around June 11, FBI Director Robert Mueller\nsaid that Snowden's leaks had caused \"significant harm to our nation and to\nour safety.\"^[57] In the same Senate hearing, NSA Director Alexander defended\nthe program.^[further explanation needed] Alexander's defense was immediately\ncriticized by Senators Udall and Wyden, who said they saw no evidence that the\nNSA programs had produced \"uniquely valuable intelligence.\" In a joint\nstatement, they wrote, \"Gen Alexander's testimony yesterday suggested that the\nNSA's bulk phone records collection program helped thwart 'dozens' of\nterrorist attacks, but all of the plots that he mentioned appear to have been\nidentified using other collection methods.\"^[57]^[58]\n\nOn June 18, NSA Director Alexander said in an open hearing before the House\nIntelligence Committee of Congress that communications surveillance had helped\nprevent more than 50 potential terrorist attacks worldwide (at least 10 of\nthem involving terrorism suspects or targets in the United States) between\n2001 and 2013, and that the PRISM web traffic surveillance program contributed\nin over 90 percent of those cases.^[59]^[60]^[61] According to court records,\none example Alexander gave regarding a thwarted attack by al Qaeda on the New\nYork Stock Exchange was not in fact foiled by surveillance.^[62] Several\nsenators wrote Director of National Intelligence Clapper asking him to provide\nother examples.^[63]\n\nU.S. intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told various\nnews outlets that by June 24 they were already seeing what they said was\nevidence that suspected terrorists had begun changing their communication\npractices in order to evade detection by the surveillance tools disclosed by\nSnowden.^[64]^[65]\n\n#### Legislative branch[edit]\n\nIn contrast to their swift and forceful reactions the previous day to\nallegations that the government had been conducting surveillance of United\nStates citizens' telephone records, Congressional leaders initially had little\nto say about the PRISM program the day after leaked information about the\nprogram was published. Several lawmakers declined to discuss PRISM, citing its\ntop-secret classification,^[66] and others said that they had not been aware\nof the program.^[67] After statements had been released by the president and\nthe Director of National Intelligence, some lawmakers began to comment:\n\nSenator John McCain (R-AZ)\n\n  * June 9, 2013, \"We passed the Patriot Act. We passed specific provisions of the act that allowed for this program to take place, to be enacted in operation.\"^[68]\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee\n\n  * June 9, \"These programs are within the law,\" \"part of our obligation is keeping Americans safe,\" \"Human intelligence isn't going to do it.\"^[69]\n  * June 9, \"Here's the rub: the instances where this has produced good\u2014has disrupted plots, prevented terrorist attacks, is all classified, that's what's so hard about this.\"^[70]\n  * June 11, \"It went fine. ... We asked him (Keith Alexander) to declassify things because it would be helpful (for people and lawmakers to better understand the intelligence programs). ... I've just got to see if the information gets declassified. I'm sure people will find it very interesting.\"^[71]\n\nSenator Rand Paul (R-KY)\n\n  * June 9, \"I'm going to be seeing if I can challenge this at the Supreme Court level. I'm going to be asking the internet providers and all of the phone companies: ask your customers to join me in a class-action lawsuit.\"^[68]\n\nSenator Susan Collins (R-ME), member of Senate Intelligence Committee and past\nmember of Homeland Security Committee\n\n  * June 11, \"I had, along with Joe Lieberman, a monthly threat briefing, but I did not have access to this highly compartmentalized information\" and \"How can you ask when you don't know the program exists?\"^[72]\n\nRepresentative Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), principal sponsor of the Patriot Act\n\n  * June 9, \"This is well beyond what the Patriot Act allows.\"^[73] \"President Obama's claim that 'this is the most transparent administration in history' has once again proven false. In fact, it appears that no administration has ever peered more closely or intimately into the lives of innocent Americans.\"^[73]\n\nRepresentative Mike Rogers (R-MI), a chairman of the Permanent Select\nCommittee on Intelligence.\n\n  * June 9, \"One of the things that we're charged with is keeping America safe and keeping our civil liberties and privacy intact. I think we have done both in this particular case.\"^[69]\n  * June 9, \"Within the last few years this program was used to stop a program, excuse me, to stop a terrorist attack in the United States, we know that. It's, it's, it's important, it fills in a little seam that we have and it's used to make sure that there is not an international nexus to any terrorism event that they may believe is ongoing in the United States. So in that regard it is a very valuable thing.\"^[74]\n\nSenator Mark Udall (D-CO)\n\n  * June 9, \"I don't think the American public knows the extent or knew the extent to which they were being surveilled and their data was being collected. ... I think we ought to reopen the Patriot Act and put some limits on the amount of data that the National Security (Agency) is collecting. ... It ought to remain sacred, and there's got to be a balance here. That is what I'm aiming for. Let's have the debate, let's be transparent, let's open this up.\"^[69]\n\nRepresentative Todd Rokita (R-IN)\n\n  * June 10, \"We have no idea when they [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court] meet, we have no idea what their judgments are.\"^[75]\n\nRepresentative Luis Gutierrez (D-IL)\n\n  * June 9, \"We will be receiving secret briefings and we will be asking, I know I'm going to be asking to get more information. I want to make sure that what they're doing is harvesting information that is necessary to keep us safe and not simply going into everybody's private telephone conversations and Facebook and communications. I mean one of the, you know, the terrorists win when you debilitate freedom of expression and privacy.\"^[74]\n\nSenator Ron Wyden (D-OR)\n\n  * July 11, \"I have a feeling that the administration is getting concerned about the bulk phone records collection, and that they are thinking about whether to move administratively to stop it. I think we are making a comeback\".^[76]\n\nFollowing these statements some lawmakers from both parties warned national\nsecurity officials during a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee that\nthey must change their use of sweeping National Security Agency surveillance\nprograms or face losing the provisions of the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act that have allowed for the agency's mass collection of\ntelephone metadata.^[77] \"Section 215 expires at the end of 2015, and unless\nyou realize you've got a problem, that is not going to be renewed,\" Rep. Jim\nSensenbrenner, R-Wis., author of the USA Patriot Act, threatened during the\nhearing.^[77] \"It's got to be changed, and you've got to change how you\noperate section 215. Otherwise, in two and a half years, you're not going to\nhave it anymore.\"^[77]\n\n#### Judicial branch[edit]\n\nLeaks of classified documents pointed to the role of a special court in\nenabling the government's secret surveillance programs, but members of the\ncourt maintained they were not collaborating with the executive branch.^[78]\nThe New York Times, however, reported in July 2013 that in \"more than a dozen\nclassified rulings, the nation's surveillance court has created a secret body\nof law giving the National Security Agency the power to amass vast collections\nof data on Americans while pursuing not only terrorism suspects, but also\npeople possibly involved in nuclear proliferation, espionage and\ncyberattacks.\"^[79] After Members of the U.S. Congress pressed the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court to release declassified versions of its secret\nruling, the court dismissed those requests arguing that the decisions can't be\ndeclassified because they contain classified information.^[80] Reggie Walton,\nthe current FISA presiding judge, said in a statement: \"The perception that\nthe court is a rubber stamp is absolutely false. There is a rigorous review\nprocess of applications submitted by the executive branch, spearheaded\ninitially by five judicial branch lawyers who are national security experts,\nand then by the judges, to ensure that the court's authorizations comport with\nwhat the applicable statutes authorize.\"^[81] The accusation of being a\n\"rubber stamp\" was further rejected by Walton who wrote in a letter to Senator\nPatrick J. Leahy: \"The annual statistics provided to Congress by the Attorney\nGeneral ...\u2014frequently cited to in press reports as a suggestion that the\nCourt's approval rate of application is over 99%\u2014reflect only the number of\nfinal applications submitted to and acted on by the Court. These statistics do\nnot reflect the fact that many applications are altered to prior or final\nsubmission or even withheld from final submission entirely, often after an\nindication that a judge would not approve them.\"^[82]\n\n#### The U.S. military[edit]\n\nThe U.S. military has acknowledged blocking access to parts of The Guardian\nwebsite for thousands of defense personnel across the country,^[83] and\nblocking the entire Guardian website for personnel stationed throughout\nAfghanistan, the Middle East, and South Asia.^[84] A spokesman said the\nmilitary was filtering out reports and content relating to government\nsurveillance programs to preserve \"network hygiene\" and prevent any classified\nmaterial from appearing on unclassified parts of its computer systems.^[83]\nAccess to the Washington Post, which also published information on classified\nNSA surveillance programs disclosed by Edward Snowden, had not been blocked at\nthe time the blocking of access to The Guardian was reported.^[84]\n\n### Responses and involvement of other countries[edit]\n\n#### Austria[edit]\n\nThe former head of the Austrian Federal Office for the Protection of the\nConstitution and Counterterrorism, Gert-Ren\u00e9 Polli, stated he knew the PRISM\nprogram under a different name and stated that surveillance activities had\noccurred in Austria as well. Polli had publicly stated in 2009 that he had\nreceived requests from US intelligence agencies to do things that would be in\nviolation of Austrian law, which Polli refused to allow.^[85]^[86]\n\n#### Australia[edit]\n\nThe Australian government has said it will investigate the impact of the PRISM\nprogram and the use of the Pine Gap surveillance facility on the privacy of\nAustralian citizens.^[87] Australia's former foreign minister Bob Carr said\nthat Australians should not be concerned about PRISM but that cybersecurity is\nhigh on the government's list of concerns.^[88] The Australian Foreign\nMinister Julie Bishop stated that the acts of Edward Snowden were treachery\nand offered a staunch defence of her nation's intelligence co-operation with\nthe United States.^[89]\n\n#### Brazil[edit]\n\nBrazil's president at the time, Dilma Rousseff, responded to Snowden's reports\nthat the NSA spied on her phone calls and emails by cancelling a planned\nOctober 2013 state visit to the United States, demanding an official apology,\nwhich by October 20, 2013, hadn't come.^[90] Also, Rousseff classified the\nspying as unacceptable between more harsh words in a speech before the UN\nGeneral Assembly on September 24, 2013.^[91] As a result, Boeing lost out on a\nUS$4.5 billion contract for fighter jets to Sweden's Saab Group.^[92]\n\n#### Canada[edit]\n\nCSE headquarters in Ottawa\n\nCanada's national cryptologic agency, the Communications Security\nEstablishment (CSE), said that commenting on PRISM \"would undermine CSE's\nability to carry out its mandate.\" Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart\nlamented Canada's standards when it comes to protecting personal online\nprivacy stating \"We have fallen too far behind\" in her report. \"While other\nnations' data protection authorities have the legal power to make binding\norders, levy hefty fines and take meaningful action in the event of serious\ndata breaches, we are restricted to a 'soft' approach: persuasion,\nencouragement and, at the most, the potential to publish the names of\ntransgressors in the public interest.\" And, \"when push comes to shove,\"\nStoddart wrote, \"short of a costly and time-consuming court battle, we have no\npower to enforce our recommendations.\"^[93]^[94]\n\n#### European Union[edit]\n\nOn 20 October 2013 a committee at the European Parliament backed a measure\nthat, if it is enacted, would require American companies to seek clearance\nfrom European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking\nprivate data. The legislation has been under consideration for two years. The\nvote is part of efforts in Europe to shield citizens from online surveillance\nin the wake of revelations about a far-reaching spying program by the U.S.\nNational Security Agency.^[95] Germany and France have also had ongoing mutual\ntalks about how they can keep European email traffic from going across\nAmerican servers.^[96]\n\n#### France[edit]\n\nOn October 21, 2013, the French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, summoned the\nU.S. Ambassador, Charles Rivkin, to the Quai d'Orsay in Paris to protest\nlarge-scale spying on French citizens by the U.S. National Security Agency\n(NSA). Paris prosecutors had opened preliminary inquiries into the NSA program\nin July, but Fabius said, \"... obviously we need to go further\" and \"we must\nquickly assure that these practices aren't repeated.\"^[97]\n\n#### Germany[edit]\n\nGermany did not receive any raw PRISM data, according to a Reuters\nreport.^[98] German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that \"the internet is new to\nall of us\" to explain the nature of the program; Matthew Schofield of\nMcClatchy Washington Bureau said, \"She was roundly mocked for that\nstatement.\"^[99] Gert-Ren\u00e9 Polli, a former Austrian counter-terrorism\nofficial, said in 2013 that it is \"absurd and unnatural\" for the German\nauthorities to pretend not to have known anything.^[85]^[86] The German Army\nwas using PRISM to support its operations in Afghanistan as early as\n2011.^[100]\n\nIn October 2013, it was reported that the NSA monitored Merkel's cell\nphone.^[101] The United States denied the report, but following the\nallegations, Merkel called President Obama and told him that spying on friends\nwas \"never acceptable, no matter in what situation.\"^[102]\n\n#### Israel[edit]\n\nIsraeli newspaper Calcalist discussed^[103] the Business Insider article^[104]\nabout the possible involvement of technologies from two secretive Israeli\ncompanies in the PRISM program\u2014Verint Systems and Narus.\n\n#### Mexico[edit]\n\nAfter finding out about the PRISM program, the Mexican Government has started\nconstructing its own spying program to spy on its own citizens. According to\nJenaro Villamil, a writer from Proceso, CISEN, Mexico's intelligence agency\nhas started to work with IBM and Hewlett Packard to develop its own data\ngathering software. \"Facebook, Twitter, Emails and other social network sites\nare going to be priority.\"^[105]\n\n#### New Zealand[edit]\n\nIn New Zealand, University of Otago information science Associate Professor\nHank Wolfe said that \"under what was unofficially known as the Five Eyes\nAlliance, New Zealand and other governments, including the United States,\nAustralia, Canada, and Britain, dealt with internal spying by saying they\ndidn't do it. But they have all the partners doing it for them and then they\nshare all the information.\"^[106]\n\nEdward Snowden, in a live streamed Google Hangout to Kim Dotcom and Julian\nAssange, alleged that he had received intelligence from New Zealand, and the\nNSA has listening posts in New Zealand.^[107]\n\n#### Spain[edit]\n\nAt a meeting of European Union leaders held the week of 21 October 2013,\nMariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, said that \"spying activities aren't\nproper among partner countries and allies\". On 28 October 2013 the Spanish\ngovernment summoned the American ambassador, James Costos, to address\nallegations that the U.S. had collected data on 60 million telephone calls in\nSpain. Separately, \u00cd\u00f1igo M\u00e9ndez de Vigo, a Spanish secretary of state,\nreferred to the need to maintain \"a necessary balance\" between security and\nprivacy concerns, but said that the recent allegations of spying, \"if proven\nto be true, are improper and unacceptable between partners and friendly\ncountries\".^[108]\n\n#### United Kingdom[edit]\n\nFurther information: Mass surveillance in the United Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ),\nwhich also has its own surveillance program, Tempora, had access to the PRISM\nprogram on or before June 2010 and wrote 197 reports with it in 2012 alone.\nThe Intelligence and Security Committee of the UK Parliament reviewed the\nreports GCHQ produced on the basis of intelligence sought from the US. They\nfound in each case a warrant for interception was in place in accordance with\nthe legal safeguards contained in UK law.^[109]\n\nIn August 2013, The Guardian newspaper's offices were visited by technicians\nfrom GCHQ, who ordered and supervised the destruction of the hard drives\ncontaining information acquired from Snowden.^[110]\n\n### Companies[edit]\n\nThe original Washington Post and Guardian articles reporting on PRISM noted\nthat one of the leaked briefing documents said PRISM involves collection of\ndata \"directly from the servers\" of several major internet services\nproviders.^[1]^[2]\n\n#### Initial public statements[edit]\n\nCorporate executives of several companies identified in the leaked documents\ntold The Guardian that they had no knowledge of the PRISM program in\nparticular and also denied making information available to the government on\nthe scale alleged by news reports.^[2]^[111] Statements of several of the\ncompanies named in the leaked documents were reported by TechCrunch and The\nWashington Post as follows:^[112]^[113]\n\n  * Microsoft: \"We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so, and never on a voluntary basis. In addition we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data, we don't participate in it.\"^[112]^[114]\n  * Yahoo!: \"Yahoo! takes users' privacy very seriously. We do not provide the government with direct access to our servers, systems, or network.\"^[112] \"Of the hundreds of millions of users we serve, an infinitesimal percentage will ever be the subject of a government data collection directive.\"^[113]\n  * Facebook: \"We do not provide any government organization with direct access to Facebook servers. When Facebook is asked for data or information about specific individuals, we carefully scrutinize any such request for compliance with all applicable laws, and provide information only to the extent required by law.\"^[112]\n  * Google: \"Google cares deeply about the security of our users' data. We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully. From time to time, people allege that we have created a government 'back door' into our systems, but Google does not have a backdoor for the government to access private user data.\"^[112] \"[A]ny suggestion that Google is disclosing information about our users' internet activity on such a scale is completely false.\"^[113]\n  * Apple: \"We have never heard of PRISM\"^[115] \"We do not provide any government agency with direct access to our servers, and any government agency requesting customer data must get a court order.\"^[115]\n  * Dropbox: \"We've seen reports that Dropbox might be asked to participate in a government program called PRISM. We are not part of any such program and remain committed to protecting our users' privacy.\"^[112]\n\nIn response to the technology companies' confirmation of the NSA being able to\ndirectly access the companies' servers, The New York Times reported that\nsources had stated the NSA was gathering the surveillance data from the\ncompanies using other technical means in response to court orders for specific\nsets of data.^[17] The Washington Post suggested, \"It is possible that the\nconflict between the PRISM slides and the company spokesmen is the result of\nimprecision on the part of the NSA author. In another classified report\nobtained by The Post, the arrangement is described as allowing 'collection\nmanagers [to send] content tasking instructions directly to equipment\ninstalled at company-controlled locations,' rather than directly to company\nservers.\"^[1] \"[I]n context, 'direct' is more likely to mean that the NSA is\nreceiving data sent to them deliberately by the tech companies, as opposed to\nintercepting communications as they're transmitted to some other\ndestination.^[113]\n\n\"If these companies received an order under the FISA amendments act, they are\nforbidden by law from disclosing having received the order and disclosing any\ninformation about the order at all,\" Mark Rumold, staff attorney at the\nElectronic Frontier Foundation, told ABC News.^[116]\n\nOn May 28, 2013, Google was ordered by United States District Court Judge\nSusan Illston to comply with a National Security Letter issued by the FBI to\nprovide user data without a warrant.^[117] Kurt Opsahl, a senior staff\nattorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in an interview with\nVentureBeat said, \"I certainly appreciate that Google put out a transparency\nreport, but it appears that the transparency didn't include this. I wouldn't\nbe surprised if they were subject to a gag order.\"^[118]\n\nThe New York Times reported on June 7, 2013, that \"Twitter declined to make it\neasier for the government. But other companies were more compliant, according\nto people briefed on the negotiations.\"^[119] The other companies held\ndiscussions with national security personnel on how to make data available\nmore efficiently and securely.^[119] In some cases, these companies made\nmodifications to their systems in support of the intelligence collection\neffort.^[119] The dialogues have continued in recent months, as General Martin\nDempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has met with executives\nincluding those at Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Intel.^[119] These details\non the discussions provide insight into the disparity between initial\ndescriptions of the government program including a training slide which\nstates, \"Collection directly from the servers\"^[120] and the companies'\ndenials.^[119]\n\nWhile providing data in response to a legitimate FISA request approved by the\nFISA Court is a legal requirement, modifying systems to make it easier for the\ngovernment to collect the data is not. This is why Twitter could legally\ndecline to provide an enhanced mechanism for data transmission.^[119] Other\nthan Twitter, the companies were effectively asked to construct a locked\nmailbox and provide the key to the government, people briefed on the\nnegotiations said.^[119] Facebook, for instance, built such a system for\nrequesting and sharing the information.^[119] Google does not provide a\nlockbox system, but instead transmits required data by hand delivery or\nssh.^[121]\n\n#### Post-PRISM transparency reports[edit]\n\nIn response to the publicity surrounding media reports of data-sharing,\nseveral companies requested permission to reveal more public information about\nthe nature and scope of information provided in response to National Security\nrequests.\n\nOn June 14, 2013, Facebook reported that the U.S. government had authorized\nthe communication of \"about these numbers in aggregate, and as a range.\" In a\npress release posted to its web site, the company reported, \"For the six\nmonths ending December 31, 2012, the total number of user-data requests\nFacebook received from any and all government entities in the U.S. (including\nlocal, state, and federal, and including criminal and national security-\nrelated requests) \u2013 was between 9,000 and 10,000.\" The company further\nreported that the requests impacted \"between 18,000 and 19,000\" user accounts,\na \"tiny fraction of one percent\" of more than 1.1 billion active user\naccounts.^[122]\n\nThat same day, Microsoft reported that for the same period, it received\n\"between 6,000 and 7,000 criminal and national security warrants, subpoenas\nand orders affecting between 31,000 and 32,000 consumer accounts from U.S.\ngovernmental entities (including local, state and federal)\" which impacted \"a\ntiny fraction of Microsoft's global customer base.\"^[123]\n\nGoogle issued a statement criticizing the requirement that data be reported in\naggregated form, stating that lumping national security requests with criminal\nrequest data would be \"a step backwards\" from its previous, more detailed\npractices on its website's transparency report. The company said that it would\ncontinue to seek government permission to publish the number and extent of\nFISA requests.^[124]\n\nCisco Systems saw a huge drop in export sales because of fears that the\nNational Security Agency could be using backdoors in its products.^[125]\n\nOn September 12, 2014, Yahoo! reported the U.S. Government threatened the\nimposition of $250,000 in fines per day if Yahoo didn't hand over user data as\npart of the NSA's PRISM program.^[126] It is not known if other companies were\nthreatened or fined for not providing data in response to a legitimate FISA\nrequests.\n\n### Public and media response[edit]\n\n#### Domestic[edit]\n\nAn elaborate graffiti in Columbus, Ohio, United States, satirizing\ncomprehensive surveillance of telecommunications\n\nThe New York Times editorial board charged that the Obama administration \"has\nnow lost all credibility on this issue,\"^[127] and lamented that \"for years,\nmembers of Congress ignored evidence that domestic intelligence-gathering had\ngrown beyond their control, and, even now, few seem disturbed to learn that\nevery detail about the public's calling and texting habits now reside in a\nN.S.A. database.\"^[128] It wrote with respect to the FISA-Court in context of\nPRISM that it is \"a perversion of the American justice system\" when \"judicial\nsecrecy is coupled with a one-sided presentation of the issues.\"^[129]\nAccording to the New York Times, \"the result is a court whose reach is\nexpanding far beyond its original mandate and without any substantive\ncheck.\"^[129]\n\nJames Robertson, a former federal district judge based in Washington who\nserved on the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court for three\nyears between 2002 and 2005 and who ruled against the Bush administration in\nthe landmark Hamdan v. Rumsfeld case, said FISA court is independent but\nflawed because only the government's side is represented effectively in its\ndeliberations. \"Anyone who has been a judge will tell you a judge needs to\nhear both sides of a case,\" said James Robertson.^[130] Without this judges do\nnot benefit from adversarial debate. He suggested creating an advocate with\nsecurity clearance who would argue against government filings.^[131] Robertson\nquestioned whether the secret FISA court should provide overall legal approval\nfor the surveillance programs, saying the court \"has turned into something\nlike an administrative agency.\" Under the changes brought by the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008, which expanded\nthe US government's authority by forcing the court to approve entire\nsurveillance systems and not just surveillance warrants as it previously\nhandled, \"the court is now approving programmatic surveillance. I don't think\nthat is a judicial function.\"^[130] Robertson also said he was \"frankly\nstunned\" by the New York Times report^[79] that FISA court rulings had created\na new body of law broadening the ability of the NSA to use its surveillance\nprograms to target not only terrorists but suspects in cases involving\nespionage, cyberattacks and weapons of mass destruction.^[130]\n\nFormer CIA analyst Valerie Plame Wilson and former U.S. diplomat Joseph\nWilson, writing in an op-ed article published in The Guardian, said that\n\"Prism and other NSA data-mining programs might indeed be very effective in\nhunting and capturing actual terrorists, but we don't have enough information\nas a society to make that decision.\"^[132]\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), an international non-profit digital-\nrights group based in the U.S., is hosting a tool, by which an American\nresident can write to their government representatives regarding their\nopposition to mass spying.^[133]\n\nThe Obama administration's argument that NSA surveillance programs such as\nPRISM and Boundless Informant had been necessary to prevent acts of terrorism\nwas challenged by several parties. Ed Pilkington and Nicholas Watt of The\nGuardian said of the case of Najibullah Zazi, who had planned to bomb the New\nYork City Subway, that interviews with involved parties and U.S. and British\ncourt documents indicated that the investigation into the case had actually\nbeen initiated in response to \"conventional\" surveillance methods such as\n\"old-fashioned tip-offs\" of the British intelligence services, rather than to\nleads produced by NSA surveillance.^[134] Michael Daly of The Daily Beast\nstated that even though Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who conducted the Boston Marathon\nbombing with his brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, had visited the Al Qaeda-\naffiliated Inspire magazine website, and even though Russian intelligence\nofficials had raised concerns with U.S. intelligence officials about Tamerlan\nTsarnaev, PRISM did not prevent him from carrying out the Boston attacks. Daly\nobserved that, \"The problem is not just what the National Security Agency is\ngathering at the risk of our privacy but what it is apparently unable to\nmonitor at the risk of our safety.\"^[135]\n\nRon Paul, a former Republican member of Congress and prominent libertarian,\nthanked Snowden and Greenwald and denounced the mass surveillance as unhelpful\nand damaging, urging instead more transparency in U.S. government\nactions.^[136] He called Congress \"derelict in giving that much power to the\ngovernment,\" and said that had he been elected president, he would have\nordered searches only when there was probable cause of a crime having been\ncommitted, which he said was not how the PRISM program was being\noperated.^[137]\n\nNew York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman defended limited government\nsurveillance programs intended to protect the American people from terrorist\nacts:\n\n> Yes, I worry about potential government abuse of privacy from a program\n> designed to prevent another 9/11\u2014abuse that, so far, does not appear to have\n> happened. But I worry even more about another 9/11. ... If there were\n> another 9/11, I fear that 99 percent of Americans would tell their members\n> of Congress: \"Do whatever you need to do to, privacy be damned, just make\n> sure this does not happen again.\" That is what I fear most. That is why I'll\n> reluctantly, very reluctantly, trade off the government using data mining to\n> look for suspicious patterns in phone numbers called and e-mail\n> addresses\u2014and then have to go to a judge to get a warrant to actually look\n> at the content under guidelines set by Congress\u2014to prevent a day where, out\n> of fear, we give government a license to look at anyone, any e-mail, any\n> phone call, anywhere, anytime.^[138]\n\nPolitical commentator David Brooks similarly cautioned that government data\nsurveillance programs are a necessary evil: \"if you don't have mass data\nsweeps, well, then these agencies are going to want to go back to the old-\nfashioned eavesdropping, which is a lot more intrusive.\"^[139]\n\nConservative commentator Charles Krauthammer worried less about the legality\nof PRISM and other NSA surveillance tools than about the potential for their\nabuse without more stringent oversight. \"The problem here is not\nconstitutionality. ... We need a toughening of both congressional oversight\nand judicial review, perhaps even some independent outside scrutiny. Plus\nperiodic legislative revision\u2014say, reauthorization every couple of years\u2014in\nlight of the efficacy of the safeguards and the nature of the external threat.\nThe object is not to abolish these vital programs. It's to fix them.\"^[140]\n\nIn a blog post, David Simon, the creator of The Wire, compared the NSA's\nprograms, including PRISM, to a 1980s effort by the City of Baltimore to add\ndialed number recorders to all pay phones to know which individuals were being\ncalled by the callers;^[141] the city believed that drug traffickers were\nusing pay phones and pagers, and a municipal judge allowed the city to place\nthe recorders. The placement of the dialers formed the basis of the show's\nfirst season. Simon argued that the media attention regarding the NSA programs\nis a \"faux scandal.\"^[141]^[142] Simon had stated that many classes of people\nin American society had already faced constant government surveillance.\n\nPolitical activist, and frequent critic of U.S. government policies, Noam\nChomsky argued, \"Governments should not have this capacity. But governments\nwill use whatever technology is available to them to combat their primary\nenemy \u2013 which is their own population.\"^[143]\n\nA CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll conducted June 11 through 13 and\nreleased in 2013 found that 66% of Americans generally supported the\nprogram.^[144]^[145]^[Notes 1] However, a Quinnipiac University poll conducted\nJune 28 through July 8 and released in 2013 found that 45% of registered\nvoters think the surveillance programs have gone too far, with 40% saying they\ndo not go far enough, compared to 25% saying they had gone too far and 63%\nsaying not far enough in 2010.^[146] Other polls have shown similar shifts in\npublic opinion as revelations about the programs were leaked.^[147]^[148]\n\nIn terms of economic impact, a study released in August by the Information\nTechnology and Innovation Foundation^[149] found that the disclosure of PRISM\ncould cost the U.S. economy between $21.5 and $35 billion in lost cloud\ncomputing business over three years.^[150]^[151]^[152]^[153]\n\n#### International[edit]\n\nSentiment around the world was that of general displeasure upon learning the\nextent of world communication data mining. Some national leaders spoke against\nthe NSA and some spoke against their own national surveillance. One national\nminister had scathing comments on the National Security Agency's data-mining\nprogram, citing Benjamin Franklin: \"The more a society monitors, controls, and\nobserves its citizens, the less free it is.\"^[154] Some question if the costs\nof hunting terrorists now overshadows the loss of citizen privacy.^[155]^[156]\n\nNick Xenophon, an Australian independent senator, asked Bob Carr, the\nAustralian Minister of Foreign Affairs, if e-mail addresses of Australian\nparliamentarians were exempt from PRISM, Mainway, Marina, and/or Nucleon.\nAfter Carr replied that there was a legal framework to protect Australians but\nthat the government would not comment on intelligence matters, Xenophon argued\nthat this was not a specific answer to his question.^[157]\n\nTaliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said, \"We knew about their past efforts\nto trace our system. We have used our technical resources to foil their\nefforts and have been able to stop them from succeeding so far.\"^[158]^[159]\nHowever CNN has reported that terrorist groups have changed their\n\"communications behaviors\" in response to the leaks.^[64]\n\nIn 2013 the Cloud Security Alliance surveyed cloud computing stakeholders\nabout their reactions to the US PRISM spying scandal. About 10% of non-US\nresidents indicated that they had cancelled a project with a US-based cloud\ncomputing provider, in the wake of PRISM; 56% said that they would be less\nlikely to use a US-based cloud computing service. The Alliance predicted that\nUS cloud computing providers might lose as much as \u20ac26 billion and 20% of its\nshare of cloud services in foreign markets because of the PRISM spying\nscandal.^[160]\n\n##### China[edit]\n\nHong Kong rally to support Snowden, June 15, 2013\n\nReactions of internet users in China were mixed between viewing a loss of\nfreedom worldwide and seeing state surveillance coming out of secrecy. The\nstory broke just before U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi\nJinping met in California.^[161]^[162] When asked about NSA hacking China, the\nspokeswoman of Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China\nsaid, \"China strongly advocates cybersecurity.\"^[163] The party-owned\nnewspaper Liberation Daily described this surveillance like Nineteen Eighty-\nFour-style.^[164] Hong Kong legislators Gary Fan and Claudia Mo wrote a letter\nto Obama stating, \"the revelations of blanket surveillance of global\ncommunications by the world's leading democracy have damaged the image of the\nU.S. among freedom-loving peoples around the world.\"^[165] Ai Weiwei, a\nChinese dissident, said, \"Even though we know governments do all kinds of\nthings I was shocked by the information about the US surveillance operation,\nPrism. To me, it's abusively using government powers to interfere in\nindividuals' privacy. This is an important moment for international society to\nreconsider and protect individual rights.\"^[166]\n\n##### Europe[edit]\n\nSophie in 't Veld, a Dutch Member of the European Parliament, called PRISM \"a\nviolation of EU laws.\"^[167]\n\nDigital rights group Digitale Gesellschaft protest at Checkpoint Charlie in\nBerlin, Germany (June 18, 2013)Protesters against PRISM in Berlin, Germany\nwearing Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden masks (June 19, 2013)\n\nThe German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of\nInformation, Peter Schaar, condemned the program as \"monstrous.\"^[168] He\nfurther added that White House claims do \"not reassure me at all\" and that\n\"given the large number of German users of Google, Facebook, Apple or\nMicrosoft services, I expect the German government ... is committed to\nclarification and limitation of surveillance.\" Steffen Seibert, press\nsecretary of the Chancellor's office, announced that Angela Merkel will put\nthese issues on the agenda of the talks with Barack Obama during his pending\nvisit in Berlin.^[169] Wolfgang Schmidt, a former lieutenant colonel with the\nStasi, said that the Stasi would have seen such a program as a \"dream come\ntrue\" since the Stasi lacked the technology that made PRISM possible.^[170]\nSchmidt expressed opposition, saying, \"It is the height of naivete to think\nthat once collected this information won't be used. This is the nature of\nsecret government organizations. The only way to protect the people's privacy\nis not to allow the government to collect their information in the first\nplace.\"^[99] Many Germans organized protests, including one at Checkpoint\nCharlie, when Obama went to Berlin to speak. Matthew Schofield of the\nMcClatchy Washington Bureau said, \"Germans are dismayed at Obama's role in\nallowing the collection of so much information.\"^[99]\n\nThe Italian president of the Guarantor for the protection of personal data,\nAntonello Soro, said that the surveillance dragnet \"would not be legal in\nItaly\" and would be \"contrary to the principles of our legislation and would\nrepresent a very serious violation.\"^[171]\n\nCNIL (French data protection watchdog) ordered Google to change its privacy\npolicies within three months or risk fines up to 150,000 euros. Spanish Agency\nof data protection (AEPD) planned to fine Google between 40,000 and 300,000\neuros if it failed to clear stored data on the Spanish users.^[172]\n\nWilliam Hague, the foreign secretary of the United Kingdom, dismissed\naccusations that British security agencies had been circumventing British law\nby using information gathered on British citizens by PRISM^[173] saying, \"Any\ndata obtained by us from the United States involving UK nationals is subject\nto proper UK statutory controls and safeguards.\"^[173] David Cameron said\nBritain's spy agencies that received data collected from PRISM acted within\nthe law: \"I'm satisfied that we have intelligence agencies that do a\nfantastically important job for this country to keep us safe, and they operate\nwithin the law.\"^[173]^[174] Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of parliament's\nIntelligence and Security Committee, said that if the British intelligence\nagencies were seeking to know the content of emails about people living in the\nUK, then they actually have to get lawful authority.^[174] The UK's\nInformation Commissioner's Office was more cautious, saying it would\ninvestigate PRISM alongside other European data agencies: \"There are real\nissues about the extent to which U.S. law agencies can access personal data of\nUK and other European citizens. Aspects of U.S. law under which companies can\nbe compelled to provide information to U.S. agencies potentially conflict with\nEuropean data protection law, including the UK's own Data Protection Act. The\nICO has raised this with its European counterparts, and the issue is being\nconsidered by the European Commission, who are in discussions with the U.S.\nGovernment.\"^[167]\n\nTim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, accused western\ngovernments of practicing hypocrisy, as they conducted spying on the internet\nwhile they criticized other countries for spying on the internet. He stated\nthat internet spying can make people feel reluctant to access intimate and\nprivate information that is important to them.^[175] In a statement given to\nFinancial Times following the Snowden revelations, Berners-Lee stated\n\"Unwarranted government surveillance is an intrusion on basic human rights\nthat threatens the very foundations of a democratic society.\"^[176]\n\n##### India[edit]\n\nMinister of External Affairs Salman Khurshid defended the PRISM program\nsaying, \"This is not scrutiny and access to actual messages. It is only\ncomputer analysis of patterns of calls and emails that are being sent. It is\nnot actually snooping specifically on content of anybody's message or\nconversation. Some of the information they got out of their scrutiny, they\nwere able to use it to prevent serious terrorist attacks in several\ncountries.\"^[177] His comments contradicted his Foreign Ministry's\ncharacterization of violations of privacy as \"unacceptable.\"^[178]^[179] When\nthe then Minister of Communications and Information Technology Kapil Sibal was\nasked about Khurshid's comments, he refused to comment on them directly, but\nsaid, \"We do not know the nature of data or information sought [as part of\nPRISM]. Even the external ministry does not have any idea.\"^[180] The media\nfelt that Khurshid's defence of PRISM was because the India government was\nrolling out the Central Monitoring System (CMS), which is similar to the PRISM\nprogram.^[181]^[182]^[183]\n\nKhurshid's comments were criticized by the Indian media,^[184]^[185] as well\nas opposition party CPI(M) who stated, \"The UPA government should have\nstrongly protested against such surveillance and bugging. Instead, it is\nshocking that Khurshid has sought to justify it. This shameful remark has come\nat a time when even the close allies of the US like Germany and France have\nprotested against the snooping on their countries.\"^[186]\n\nRajya Sabha MP P. Rajeev told The Times of India that \"The act of the USA is a\nclear violation of Vienna convention on diplomatic relations. But Khurshid is\ntrying to justify it. And the speed of the government of India to reject the\nasylum application of Edward Snowden is shameful.\"^[187]\n\n## Legal aspects[edit]\n\n### Applicable law and practice[edit]\n\nOn June 8, 2013, the Director of National Intelligence issued a fact sheet\nstating that PRISM \"is not an undisclosed collection or data mining program,\"\nbut rather \"an internal government computer system\" used to facilitate the\ncollection of foreign intelligence information \"under court supervision, as\nauthorized by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)\n(50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1881a).\"^[54] Section 702 provides that \"the Attorney General and\nthe Director of National Intelligence may authorize jointly, for a period of\nup to 1 year from the effective date of the authorization, the targeting of\npersons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States to acquire\nforeign intelligence information.\"^[188] In order to authorize the targeting,\nthe attorney general and Director of National Intelligence need to obtain an\norder from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court) pursuant\nto Section 702 or certify that \"intelligence important to the national\nsecurity of the United States may be lost or not timely acquired and time does\nnot permit the issuance of an order.\"^[188] When requesting an order, the\nattorney general and Director of National Intelligence must certify to the\nFISA Court that \"a significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign\nintelligence information.\"^[188] They do not need to specify which facilities\nor property will be targeted.^[188]\n\nAfter receiving a FISA Court order or determining that there are emergency\ncircumstances, the attorney general and Director of National Intelligence can\ndirect an electronic communication service provider to give them access to\ninformation or facilities to carry out the targeting and keep the targeting\nsecret.^[188] The provider then has the option to: (1) comply with the\ndirective; (2) reject it; or (3) challenge it with the FISA Court. If the\nprovider complies with the directive, it is released from liability to its\nusers for providing the information and is reimbursed for the cost of\nproviding it,^[188] while if the provider rejects the directive, the attorney\ngeneral may request an order from the FISA Court to enforce it.^[188] A\nprovider that fails to comply with the FISA Court's order can be punished with\ncontempt of court.^[188]\n\nFinally, a provider can petition the FISA Court to reject the directive.^[188]\nIn case the FISA Court denies the petition and orders the provider to comply\nwith the directive, the provider risks contempt of court if it refuses to\ncomply with the FISA Court's order.^[188] The provider can appeal the FISA\nCourt's denial to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review and\nthen appeal the Court of Review's decision to the Supreme Court by a writ of\ncertiorari for review under seal.^[188]\n\nThe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the FISA Courts had been put\nin place to oversee intelligence operations in the period after the death of\nJ. Edgar Hoover. Beverly Gage of Slate said, \"When they were created, these\nnew mechanisms were supposed to stop the kinds of abuses that men like Hoover\nhad engineered. Instead, it now looks as if they have come to function as\nrubber stamps for the expansive ambitions of the intelligence community. J.\nEdgar Hoover no longer rules Washington, but it turns out we didn't need him\nanyway.\"^[189]\n\n### Litigation[edit]\n\nDate| Litigant| Description  \n---|---|---  \nJune 11, 2013| American Civil Liberties Union| Lawsuit filed against the NSA\nciting that the \"Mass Call Tracking Program\" (as the case terms PRISM)\n\"violates Americans' constitutional rights of free speech, association, and\nprivacy\" and constitutes \"dragnet\" surveillance, in violation of the First and\nFourth Amendments to the Constitution, and thereby also \"exceeds the authority\ngranted by 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861, and thereby violates 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706.\"^[190] The\ncase was joined by Yale Law School, on behalf of its Media Freedom and\nInformation Access Clinic.^[191]  \nJune 11, 2013| FreedomWatch USA| Class action lawsuit against government\nbodies and officials believed responsible for PRISM, and 12 companies\n(including Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Skype and their chief\nexecutives) who have been disclosed as providing or making available mass\ninformation about their users' communications and data to the NSA under the\nPRISM program or related programs. The case cites the First, Fourth, and Fifth\nAmendments to the Constitution, as well as breach of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72702\n(disclosure of communications records), and asks the court to rule that the\nprogram operates outside its legal authority (s.215 of the Patriot Act). The\nclass includes the plaintiffs and^[192]\n\n    \"other American citizens who, in addition to being members of the Nationwide Class, had their telephone calls and/or emails and/or any other communications made or received through Facebook, Google, Yahoo, YouTube, Skype, AOL, Sprint, AT&T, Apple, Microsoft and/or PalTalk actually recorded and/or listened into by or on behalf of [the] Defendants.\"\nIn November 2017, the district court dismissed the case.  \nFebruary 18, 2014| Rand Paul and Freedom Works, Inc.| Lawsuit filed against\nPresident Barack Obama, James R. Clapper, as Director of National\nIntelligence, Keith B. Alexander, as director of the NSA, James B. Comey, as\ndirector of the FBI, in the United States District Court for the District of\nColumbia. The case contends that the Defendants are violating the Fourth\nAmendment of the United States by collecting phone metadata. The case is\ncurrently stayed pending the outcome of the government's appeal in the\nFreedomWatch USA/Klayman case.  \nJune 2, 2014| Elliott J. Schuchardt| Lawsuit filed against President Barack\nObama, James R. Clapper, as Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Michael\nR. Rogers, as director of the NSA, James B. Comey, as director of the FBI, in\nthe United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The\ncase contends that the Defendants are violating the Fourth Amendment of the\nUnited States by collecting the full content of e-mail in the United States.\nThe complaint asks the Court to find the Defendants' program unconstitutional,\nand seeks an injunction. The court is currently considering the government's\nmotion to dismiss this case.  \n  \n### Analysis of legal issues[edit]\n\nLaura Donohue, a law professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and its\nCenter on National Security and the Law, has called PRISM and other NSA mass\nsurveillance programs unconstitutional.^[193]\n\nWoodrow Hartzog, an affiliate at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and\nSociety commented that \"[The ACLU will] likely have to demonstrate legitimate\nFirst Amendment harms (such as chilling effects) or Fourth Amendment harms\n(perhaps a violation of a reasonable expectation of privacy) ... Is it a harm\nto merely know with certainty that you are being monitored by the government?\nThere's certainly an argument that it is. People under surveillance act\ndifferently, experience a loss of autonomy, are less likely to engage in self\nexploration and reflection, and are less willing to engage in core expressive\npolitical activities such as dissenting speech and government criticism. Such\ninterests are what First and Fourth Amendment seek to protect.\"^[194]\n\n### Legality of the FISA Amendments Act[edit]\n\nThe FISA Amendments Act (FAA) Section 702 is referenced in PRISM documents\ndetailing the electronic interception, capture and analysis of metadata. Many\nreports and letters of concern written by members of Congress suggest that\nthis section of FAA in particular is legally and constitutionally problematic,\nsuch as by targeting U.S. persons, insofar as \"Collections occur in U.S.\" as\npublished documents indicate.^[195]^[196]^[197]^[198]\n\nThe ACLU has asserted the following regarding the FAA: \"Regardless of abuses,\nthe problem with the FAA is more fundamental: the statute itself is\nunconstitutional.\"^[199]\n\nSenator Rand Paul is introducing new legislation called the Fourth Amendment\nRestoration Act of 2013 to stop the NSA or other agencies of the United States\ngovernment from violating the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution using\ntechnology and big data information systems like PRISM and Boundless\nInformant.^[200]^[201]\n\n## Programs sharing the name PRISM[edit]\n\nBesides the information collection program started in 2007, there are two\nother programs sharing the name PRISM:^[202]\n\n  * The Planning tool for Resource Integration, Synchronization and Management (PRISM), a web tool used by US military intelligence to send tasks and instructions to data collection platforms deployed to military operations.^[203]\n  * The Portal for Real-time Information Sharing and Management (PRISM), whose existence was revealed by the NSA in July 2013.^[202] This is an internal NSA program for real-time sharing of information which is apparently located in the NSA's Information Assurance Directorate.^[202] The NSA's Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) is a very secretive division which is responsible for safeguarding U.S. government and military secrets by implementing sophisticated encryption techniques.^[202]\n\n## Related NSA programs[edit]\n\nMain article: List of government mass surveillance projects\n\nIdea behind the MUSCULAR program, which gave direct access to Google and Yahoo\nprivate clouds, no warrants needed\n\nParallel programs, known collectively as SIGADs gather data and metadata from\nother sources, each SIGAD has a set of defined sources, targets, types of data\ncollected, legal authorities, and software associated with it. Some SIGADs\nhave the same name as the umbrella under which they sit, BLARNEY's (the SIGAD)\nsummary, set down in the slides alongside a cartoon insignia of a shamrock and\na leprechaun hat, describes it as \"an ongoing collection program that\nleverages IC [intelligence community] and commercial partnerships to gain\naccess and exploit foreign intelligence obtained from global networks.\"\n\nSome SIGADs, like PRISM, collect data at the ISP level, but others take it\nfrom the top-level infrastructure. This type of collection is known as\n\"upstream\". Upstream collection includes programs known by the blanket terms\nBLARNEY, FAIRVIEW, OAKSTAR and STORMBREW, under each of these are individual\nSIGADs. Data that is integrated into a SIGAD can be gathered in other ways\nbesides upstream, and from the service providers, for instance it can be\ncollected from passive sensors around embassies, or even stolen from an\nindividual computer network in a hacking attack.^[204]^[205]^[206]^[207]^[208]\nNot all SIGADs involve upstream collection, for instance, data could be taken\ndirectly from a service provider, either by agreement (as is the case with\nPRISM), by means of hacking, or other ways.^[209]^[210]^[211] According to the\nWashington Post, the much less known MUSCULAR program, which directly taps the\nunencrypted data inside the Google and Yahoo private clouds, collects more\nthan twice as many data points compared to PRISM.^[212] Because the Google and\nYahoo clouds span the globe, and because the tap was done outside of the\nUnited States, unlike PRISM, the MUSCULAR program requires no (FISA or other\ntype of) warrants.^[213]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * United States portal\n  * Politics portal\n\n  * Central Monitoring System\n  * Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a U.S. wiretapping law passed in 1994\n  * DRDO NETRA\n  * ECHELON, a signals intelligence collection and analysis network operated on behalf of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States\n  * Economic espionage\n  * Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n  * INDECT, European Union automatic threat detection research project\n  * Information Awareness Office, a defunct DARPA project\n  * Law Enforcement Information Exchange\n  * Lawful interception\n  * Mass surveillance\n  * Muscular (surveillance program)\n  * NSA call database, contains call detail information for hundreds of billions of telephone calls made through the largest U.S. telephone carriers\n  * Room 641A\n  * Signals intelligence\n  * SORM, Russian telephone and internet surveillance project\n  * Surveillance\n  * Targeted surveillance\n  * Tempora, the data-gathering project run by the British GCHQ\n  * TURBINE (US government project)\n  * Utah Data Center, a data storage facility supporting the U.S. Intelligence Community\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ The precise question was: [F]or the past few years the Obama administration has reportedly been gathering and analyzing information from major internet companies about audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, and documents involving people in other countries in an attempt to locate suspected terrorists. The government reportedly does not target internet usage by US citizens and if such data is collected, it is kept under strict controls. Do you think the Obama administration was right or wrong in gathering and analyzing that internet data?\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g ^h ^i Gellman, Barton; Poitras, Laura (June 6, 2013). \"US Intelligence Mining Data from Nine U.S. Internet Companies in Broad Secret Program\".
