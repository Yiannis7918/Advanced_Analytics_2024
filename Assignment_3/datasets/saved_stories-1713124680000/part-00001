The original series ran from 2010 - 2012 and was given\na minor update in 2015. The series was rebooted in 2021 and ran until 2023.\nThe Everything is a Remix series has been seen at least several million times.\nI've lost track. From 2012 to 2020 (yikes) I created the full-length doc This\nis Not a Conspiracy Theory.
