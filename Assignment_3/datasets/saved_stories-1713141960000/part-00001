Crumb, The Art of Comics No. 1\n\nInterviewed by Ted Widmer\n\n### Issue 193, Summer 2010\n\nRobert Crumb asked me to say that he lives in Albania, to discourage would-be\npilgrims from beating a path to his doorstep. He doesn\u2019t, but his medieval\nhamlet is so far from the United States in every sense that it takes some\nperseverance to find, and upon locating it, I discovered that the streets of\nhis walled village are too narrow to penetrate with even the tiniest French\nrental car. I mean, Albanian.\n\nBut even this tiny community was too distracting when it came time to draw and\nink the extraordinarily detailed illustrations for The Book of Genesis, which\nwas published last year. Like a monastic scribe, he pursued his vision in a\ndesolate shelter in the mountains outside town, working for weeks without\nhuman contact. These mountains have harbored many heretics over the centuries,\nbut Crumb\u2019s Genesis was an act of textual devotion, precise to the last\n\u201cbegat.\u201d\n\nCrumb is perhaps the most influential cartoonist of his or any generation,\nfamous for decades of work that reflect an idiosyncratic variety of\nfascinations\u2014arcane twenties music, everyday street scenes, the female\nform\u2014yet have proved capable of mass appeal. But \u201ccartoonist\u201d fails to convey\nthe full scope of the Crumb oeuvre, which includes the handmade comics he\ncreated as a teenager; the underground periodicals he generated by the score\nin the sixties; and the increasingly realistic work he has produced since\nthen, probing the lives of twenties bluesmen, authors, biblical patriarchs,\nand his own family. In all of the places he has lived, Crumb has been a\ncreator of books on his own terms, helping to spawn a thriving DIY print\nculture of zines and graphic novels that has revived and reinvented the comic\nform. It is a remarkable achievement for someone who came of age when the\ncomic book was the lowest form of literary life imaginable, attacked by\nCongress and shunned or ignored by respectable society.\n\nWhen the weary traveler finally locates Crumb\u2019s house, where he lives with his\nwife Aline Kominsky-Crumb, a small sign in his unmistakable hand warns the\nmailman, pas de pub svp\u2014no advertisements, please. Crumb is equally jaundiced\ntoward the media, and remains distrustful of many aspects of contemporary\nlife, including e-mail and the Internet. But modernity is not much of a threat\ninside his seventeenth-century home. Books are packed in everywhere, and in\nhis collections the centuries begin to crowd each other out\u2014a Brueghel print\nfrom the fifteen hundreds hangs on the wall next to a racy ad from the\nnineteen forties. When the tape was not rolling, we listened to many of\nCrumb\u2019s favorites from a library of more than five thousand 78-rpm\nrecords\u2014including Blind Mamie Forehand, Chubby Parker, and Skip\nJames\u2014witnesses to a past that never ceases to exist as long as the record is\nintact and the turntable spins.\n\nINTERVIEWER\n\nLet\u2019s begin with Genesis. Where did this book come from?\n\nCRUMB\n\nWell, the truth is kind of dumb, actually. I did it for the money and I\nquickly began to regret it. It was an enormous amount of work\u2014four years of\nwork and barely worth it. I was too compulsive about the detail. With comics,\nyou\u2019ve got to develop some kind of shorthand. You can\u2019t make every drawing\nlook like a detailed etching. The average reader actually doesn\u2019t want all\nthat detail, it interferes with the flow of the reading process. But I just\ncan\u2019t help myself\u2014obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nINTERVIEWER\n\nBut it does also seem like a labor of love.\n\nCRUMB\n\nI did try to be respectful. I decided not to make fun of the text, not to put\nany kind of jokey stuff in there. I was tempted a few times. But I whited it\nout later because it distracts from the text. The text itself is so compelling\nthat merely illustrating it is enough. But people who believe that the Bible\nis the word of God, you\u2019re not going to please them. They\u2019ll find faults. The\nJews won\u2019t like it because you actually portray God. And the fact that I show\npeople actually having sex, that\u2019s going to eliminate a lot of the Christians.\n\nINTERVIEWER\n\nYou\u2019ve shown how much strangeness is in the story.\n\nCRUMB\n\nI think that the best public service that it has to offer is that it brings\neverything out. It illustrates everything equally. Even the strangest stories,\nstories that don\u2019t make much sense. The Bible was not written for\nentertainment purposes so it\u2019s a real hodgepodge and a compendium of all kinds\nof stuff.\n\nINTERVIEWER\n\nDid you read the comic-book versions of the Bible as a kid?\n\nCRUMB\n\nI didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t interested. In my midteens I went through a brief stage of\nreligious fanaticism but it was very much about just saying prayers and stuff\nlike that, reciting rosaries and spending a lot of time on that kind of\nCatholic ritual. My brother Charles admired Saint Francis, he\u2019d walk around\nwith stones in his shoes. But soon we started to see through it, my brother\nand I started questioning the church and it fell apart very quickly for us.\n\nINTERVIEWER\n\nYou wrote in your introduction that you actually stay truer to the words of\nGenesis than a lot of those comic-book versions.\n\nCRUMB\n\nIn all the comic-book versions I was able to find, they just made up dialogue,\npages of it that are not in the Bible. I was reading this one thing and I\nthought\u2014did I miss this? And I went back and checked against the text and it\u2019s\nnot in there. And they claim to be honoring the word of God, and that the\nBible is a sacred text. But they\u2019re just making shit up! If you\u2019re not going\nto make it up, then the only way is to tell the whole thing. You have to put\nin every word, and that\u2019s a very cumbersome task that only a fool would take\non.\n\nINTERVIEWER\n\nGenesis is obviously a graphic novel, but the cover is like a fifties comic-\nbook cover.\n\nCRUMB\n\nIt\u2019s a Classics Illustrated! I had to argue with them to let me call it\n\u201cillustrated.\u201d They wanted to call it The Book of Genesis According to R.\nCrumb but I preferred \u201cillustrated by.\u201d I wanted a humbler position. It\u2019s an\nillustration job, OK? Illustration has a bad name in modern culture because\nfor decades artists who were \u201cmere illustrators\u201d were considered inferior to\nfine artists. Being an illustrator was looked down upon. It meant you were not\nreally a creative person, you just had the technical skills that you were\nlending to someone else\u2019s ideas. It\u2019s all bullshit though\u2014the fine-art world,\nthe myth of the creative genius artist.\n\nI made the drawings nice, and the people who like that kind of thing, the\naesthetics, are impressed, but the most significant thing is actually\nillustrating everything that\u2019s in there. That\u2019s the most significant\ncontribution I made. It brings everything out. Comic books are good for that.\nMany of the educational experiences I\u2019ve had about important things, I got\nfrom comic books. A Japanese artist did a comic book about his childhood\ngrowing up in militaristic Japan and about the dropping of the bomb. It\u2019s\ncalled Gen of Hiroshima. It\u2019s so powerful and vivid. Also Joe Sacco\u2019s book\nPalestine and his book about Bosnia, or Spiegelman\u2019s Maus, a powerful story of\nthe Holocaust. Those are some of the strongest revelations of what happened.\n\nINTERVIEWER\n\nHow did you get your hands on the research material for Genesis from a\nmedieval village in Southern France?\n\nCRUMB\n\nHey, come on, this is the electronic age! You can get anything, anywhere! A\nfriend got me the DVD of The Ten Commandments and some other biblical epics\nand he freeze-framed them and he took hundreds of photos. I developed a great\nrespect for Cecil B. DeMille. When you freeze-frame it and look at it closely,\nevery detail is really interesting. You\u2019ve got these donkeys pulling primitive\ncarts with big urns all tied up with ropes, and I used all of that. All the\nstatuary, the rows of the lions as you come out of the city of the pharaoh.\nIt\u2019s beautifully made and all the craft and attention to detail, it was really\nquite remarkable.\n\n# Want to keep reading?
