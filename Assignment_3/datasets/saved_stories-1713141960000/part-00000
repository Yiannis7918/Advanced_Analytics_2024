Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Nvidia's RTX 5080 and 5090 GPUs might arrive later in 2024 \u2014 and it's\nhonestly way too soon\n\nOpinion\n\nBy Allisa James\n\npublished 2 days ago\n\nThis could be a bad idea\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nNvidia\u2019s next generation of graphics cards, reportedly known as Nvidia\nBlackwell, has been the subject of plenty of rumors since at least 2023.\n\nThe most recent one seems to confirm that the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 will be\nlaunching in Q4 2024, according to Twitter leaker Kopite7kimi and reported on\nby PC Gamer. While finally getting a hold of what could easily be the best\ngraphics cards sounds like great news to some, finally getting a sign of the\ncards\u2019 imminent release, they\u2019re honestly coming out way too soon.\n\nThere have been reports that the Nvidia RTX 5080 would have better ray tracing\ncapabilities and pricing than the 4080 and that the RTX 5090 would be up to\n70% faster than the 4090, which sounds great on paper. But when you consider\nhow already powerful the 4000 series of cards are, it seems a bit pointless.\nIt\u2019s wonderful that ray tracing, speed, and performance might be improved, but\nto what benefit?\n\n## We aren't even taking full advantage of current gen cards, so what's the\nvalue of buying a Nvidia 5000-series GPU later this year?\n\nPC games haven\u2019t even reached the point that they truly challenge the mid-\nrange and high-end 3000-series of graphics cards (hell, an argument can be\nmade that they can\u2019t fully challenge the RTX 2070 Super in ways that truly\nmatter), let alone the current gen. One could argue that the only reason why\nthe current gen was so necessary was thanks to the crypto mining craze\ncompletely ruining the 3000-series market and making it nigh impossible to get\nyour hands on one for a remotely affordable price.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar\n\nAnd right now, the 4000-series is quite excellent performance-wise, as it\u2019s\nable to handle ray tracing and other advanced effects and tools like no other.\nThe RTX 4090 in particular is nearly perfect in what it can offer, and the\nlower cards are still absolute performance beasts. This isn\u2019t even mentioning\nthe Super series refreshes, which added even more oomph to your favorite\ngraphics cards while keeping the prices either the same or lowering them.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that some cards, like the RTX 4070, didn\u2019t sell nearly\nas well as Nvidia wanted and in fact were rumored to be a \u201cdisaster.\u201d While\nthat doesn\u2019t reflect the sales numbers for the rest of the graphics cards,\nit\u2019s not a good look to see the base versions of your mid-range cards doing\npoorly. And while the RTX 4080 Super seems to be out of stock in many\nretailers, that could just as well be due to low stock in the first place.\n\nWith all these issues cropping up, releasing RTX 5080 and 5090 doesn\u2019t seem to\nbe such a smart move on Nvidia\u2019s part. Though the Q4 2024 launch date is still\njust a rumor, it would be wise for the tech giant to release these cards in\n2025 at the earliest to give its 4000-series some proper breathing room.\n\n### You might also like\n\n  * Nvidia RTX 5080 leak gets some PC gamers worried that Team Green hasn't learned\n  * The Nvidia RTX 5090 is rumored to be nearly twice as fast as RTX 4090\n  * Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 could be up to 70% faster than the 4090\n\n## Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\n\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion,\nanalysis and more from the TechRadar team.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nAllisa James\n\nComputing Staff Writer\n\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2023 Media Trailblazer, Allisa is a Computing Staff\nWriter who covers breaking news and rumors in the computing industry, as well\nas reviews, hands-on previews, featured articles, and the latest deals and\ntrends.
