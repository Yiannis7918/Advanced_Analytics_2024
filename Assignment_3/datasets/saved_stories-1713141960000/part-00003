This\nkeyboard comes in 2 variants, a 30 inch (762mm) or 7ft-2in (2184mm) size. The\n7ft version can be converted to 44 inches (1117mm). It features 2 numpad\npositions with layout options that you'd expect from a mechanical keyboard\nplus a rotary encoder and a small macro cluster. Both versions are gasket\nmounted.\n\nThe 7ft version has mounting hooks on the back so that it can be mounted onto\na wall for storage or display. The 7ft version will feature an ESC Key in the\nvery top left corner just like the prototype. It's not shown in the product\nphotos but it will be there.\n\n## Materials\n\nThe 30 inch version is made with 3mm stacked matte black acrylic. It hides\nfingerprints and sounds great! The 7ft versions is printed in matte black PLA.\nIt takes a week of constant printing!\n\n## More Details\n\n  * Supports Windows, Mac and Linux\n  * User guide is available here\n  * Build guide is available here\n  * Compatible with mil-max sockets\n  * Through-hole Kit - You'll need switches, stabilizers, and keycaps.
