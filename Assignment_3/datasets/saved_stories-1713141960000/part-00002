Hershfield studies the\npsychology of long term decisions-making.\n\n\"With more wealth comes more of a focus on transactional relationships, which\ncould then bleed over into relationships that should be communal,\" Hershfield\nsays.\n\nLet's say you're moving apartments. If you're trying to save money, you might\nenlist the help of a few friends. This favor signals a communal relationship.\n\nIf you earn enough money to pay for movers, then this experience becomes\ntransactional.\n\nSoon, you might start to see the world in a more transactional way, he says,\nand that will seep into your friendships.\n\nIf a friend Venmo requests you for small amount of money, Bradley suggests\ndoing two things: pay it and then ask if something else is going on with them.\n\n\"If they're doing that, it's a way of not being taken advantage of,\" she says.\n\"It could be about something in the past with longer legs that hasn't been\ndealt with. They don't care about the $4.\"\n\nWant to land your dream job in 2024?
