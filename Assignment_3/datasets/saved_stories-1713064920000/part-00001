(Part 2)\n\njohnmayosmith.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nPart I of this post hypothesized that ChatGPT is a tour guide leading us\nthrough a high-dimensional version of the computer game Minecraft.\n\nOutrageous? Absolutely, but I tested the hypothesis anyway and stumbled upon a\nstrikingly eerie discovery deep within GPT. Here\u2019s what I found and the steps\nI took to uncover it.\n\nTo begin, let\u2019s clarify what we mean by \u201cdimension.\u201d Then we\u2019ll collect\ndimensional data from GPT-4 and compare it to Minecraft. Finally, just for\nfun, we\u2019ll create a Minecraft world that uses actual GPT-4 data structures and\nsee how it looks.\n\nTo clarify \u2018dimension,\u2019 consider this quote:\n\n\u201cI think it's important to understand and think about GPT-4 as a tool, not a\ncreature, which is easy to get confused...\u201d\u2014Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI,\ntestimony before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology (May\n16, 2023)\n\nHorse or hammer? We could just ask ChatGPT. However, the answer will hinge on\nChatGPT\u2019s level of self-awareness, which itself depends on how creature-like\nit is, creating a catch-22.\n\nInstead, we'll use our intuition and look at the problem in different\ndimensions. Dimensions are a measurable extent of some kind. For example in a\n\u201ctool\u201d dimension, a hammer seems more \u201ctool-like\u201d than a horse. In two\ndimensions, it\u2019s a similar story. Horses are both more creature-like and less\ntool-like than hammers.\n\nWhere does GPT fit in? Probably closer to the hammer in both cases.\n\nWhat if we add a third dimension called \u201cintelligence?\u201d Here\u2019s where things\nget interesting. Horses are smarter than a bag of hammers and GPT seems pretty\nsmart too. So, in these three dimensions GPT may actually be somewhere between\na horse and a hammer.\n\nVisualizing two dimensions is easy, three dimensions is a little harder but\nthere\u2019s no reason we couldn\u2019t describe horses and hammers in thousands of\ndimensions. In fact there are good reasons to do this because measuring things\nacross multiple dimensions enhances understanding. The marvel of GPT is it\nseems to have plotted not just horses and hammers but almost everything there\nis in thousands of dimensions!\n\nBut how does GPT represent things in thousands of dimensions?\n\nWith something called embeddings.\n\nEmbeddings are a way to convert words, pictures and other data into a list of\nnumbers so computers can grasp their meanings and make comparisons.\n\nLet's say we wanted to have a computer grasp the meaning of apples and lemons.\nAssigning a number to each fruit might work, but fruits are more complex than\na single number. So, we use a list of numbers, where each number says\nsomething like how it looks, how it tastes, and the nutritional content. These\nlists are embeddings and they help ChatGPT know that apples and lemons are\nboth fruits but taste different.\n\nSadly, GPT embeddings defy human comprehension and visualization. For example,\nthree thousand embeddings for just the word \u201capple\u201d look like this:\n\nIs it possible to reduce the number of dimensions without compromising the\noverall structure? Fortunately, this sort of thing happens all the time\u2014on a\nsunny day, your shadow is a two-dimensional representation of your three-\ndimensional body. There are fancy ways of performing reductions\nmathematically, but we\u2019re going to keep things really simple and just take the\nfirst three embeddings that OpenAI gives us and throw away the rest.\n\nCould this possibly work?\n\nLet\u2019s find out. We\u2019ll kick things off by selecting a few words to experiment\nwith: horse, hammer, apple, and lemon.Then, to keep things interesting, we\u2019ll\nalso pick a few words and phrases that may (or may not) be semantically\nconnected: \u201ccinnamon,\u201d \u201cgiven to teachers,\u201d \u201cpie crust,\u201d \u201changs from a\nbranch,\u201d and \u201ccrushed ice.\u201d\n\nNext, we\u2019ll look up their embeddings. OpenAI makes this easy with something\ncalled an embedding engine. You give it a word or phrase and it returns a list\nof three thousand embeddings (3,072 to be exact).\n\nUsing a snippet of code we\u2019ll take the first three embeddings for each word\nand discard the rest. Here\u2019s the result:\n\nWhat exactly are these numbers? If we're being honest, nobody really knows;\nthey seem to pinpoint the location of each word and phrase within a specific,\nsomewhat mysterious dimension inside GPT. For our purposes, let\u2019s treat the\nembeddings as though they were x, y, z coordinates. This approach requires an\nastoundingly audacious leap of faith, but we won\u2019t dwell on that\u2014instead,\nwe'll plot them on a graph and see what emerges.\n\nDo you see it?!!\n\nJohn Firth would be proud. Apple-ish things seem to be neighbors (ready to\nmake a pie). Crushed ice and lemons are next to each other (ready to make\nlemonade). Hammer is off in a corner.\n\nIf you're not completely blown away by this result, maybe it's because you\u2019re\na data scientist who's seen it all before. For me, I can\u2019t believe what just\nhappened: we looked up the embeddings for nine words and phrases, discarded\n99.9% of the data, and then plotted the remaining bits on a 3D graph\u2014and\namazingly, the locations make intuitive sense!\n\nStill not astonished? Then perhaps you're wondering how all this relates to\nMinecraft. For the gamers, we're about to take the analysis one step further.\n\nUsing Minecraft Classic, we\u2019ll build an 8 x 8 x 8 walled garden, then \u201cplot\u201d\nthe words and phrases just like we did in the 3D graph. Here\u2019s what that looks\nlike:\n\nNotice that the positions of the words and phrases in the garden match those\nin the 3D graph. That\u2019s because embeddings act like location coordinates in a\nvirtual world\u2014in this case, Minecraft. What we\u2019ve done is take a\n3,072-dimensional embedding space and reduce it down to a three-dimensional\n'shadow' space in Minecraft, which can then explored like this:\n\nWho's the explorer leaping through our garden? That's ChatGPT, the high-\ndimensional docent, fluent in complex data structures\u2014our emissary to the\nelegant and mysterious world of GPT. When we submit a prompt, it is ChatGPT\nwho discerns our intent (no small feat, using something called attention\nmechanisms), then glides effortlessly through thousands of dimensions to lead\nus to exactly the right spot in the GPT universe.\n\nDoes all this mean ChatGPT is actually a tour guide from another world? Is it\nactually operating inside a high-dimensional game space? While we can't say\nfor certain, GPT does seem more game-like than either a horse or a hammer:\n\n### Subscribe to John Mayo-Smith's Substack\n\nLaunched a year ago\n\nMayo In Motion\n\n1 Like\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### What if ChatGPT is Actually a Tour Guide From Another World?
