With $75 million over five years for this second phase of the\nHub, NAWI will continue to bring together a team of industry and academic\npartners to examine the critical technical barriers and research needed to\nradically lower the cost and energy of water purification technologies. The\nadvancements in desalination technologies will help propel the modernization\nof America\u2019s water infrastructure, increase access to clean, potable water for\nall Americans, and move the country toward a net-zero emissions economy by\n2050.\n\n\u201cWater and energy are interdependent\u2014water is used to produce nearly every\nmajor energy source, and energy is critical to transporting and treating\nwater,\u201d said Jeff Marootian, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the\nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. \u201cThe deep connection between\nthese two resources demands an integrated approach that considers the\nchallenges and opportunities inherent to both sectors. The Department of\nEnergy is proud to be leading the nation\u2019s efforts to decarbonize the water\neconomy, while ensuring a secure water future for communities nationwide.\u201d\n\nCurrent water supply systems in the U.S. rely primarily on fresh surface and\ngroundwater, with a small percentage coming from desalinated salt water.\nHowever, climate change, population growth, greater industrial and\nagricultural demand, and changes in how communities use water are placing\nincreasing stress on these fresh water supplies worldwide. To supply the water\nneeds of the future, it is critical that the U.S. develop technologies that\nprovide alternative water sources and treat and use water in ways that are\nefficient, sustainable, cost-effective, and minimize energy use and greenhouse\ngas emissions.\n\nNAWI and other partners across industry, government, and academia are\ninvesting in technologies to mitigate these effects on the water cycle. These\ntechnologies will focus on treating water from alternative sources like\nbrackish groundwater and various wastewaters to create more fit-for-purpose\nwater while reducing emissions and energy use associated with traditional\nwater treatment. In its first five years, NAWI funded more than 60 projects,\nincluding pilots, projects across the United States focusing on a combination\nof water treatment, desalination unit processes, novel automation and water\ntreatment, desalination processes, and modeling tools and analysis. This\nincluded projects from early-stage research through pilot scale. Additionally,\nthe hub published the NAWI Master Roadmap and five sector-specific roadmaps\n(power, resource extraction, industry, municipal, and agriculture) as they\nrelate to key technical challenges and research priorities in desalination and\ntreatment of nontraditional source waters. power, resource extraction,\nindustry, municipal, and agriculture) as they relate to key technical\nchallenges and research priorities in desalination and treatment of\nnontraditional source waters.\n\nNAWI has the largest extended community of any DOE hub or institute, with 108\nResearch Consortium member organizations (members who have won competitive\nawards) and more than 424 Alliance Organizations and 17,000 individuals.\n\nBuilding on the success of the first iteration of NAWI, the second iteration\nof NAWI, or NAWI 2.0, will dive deeper into the following energy-water\nchallenges: 1) increasing focus on piloting integrated energy efficient and\ndecarbonized water systems, including treatment, delivery, and management; 2)\nemphasizing reuse of a variety of wastewaters; 3) convening technology\ndevelopers, water managers, and communities to identify priority opportunities\nfor optimizing water supply management.\n\nNAWI is led by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in collaboration with the\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and is\nfunded by DOE\u2019s Industrial Efficiency and Decarbonization and Water Power\nTechnologies offices.\n\nOffice of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy\n\nOffice of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy Forrestal Building 1000\nIndependence Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20585\n\nFacebook Twitter Youtube Linkedin\n\nAn office of\n\n#### About Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy\n\n* EERE Home\n* EERE Publications\n* Contact EERE\n\n#### Energy.gov Resources\n\n* Budget & Performance\n* Covid-19 Response\n* Directives, Delegations & Requirements\n* FOIA\n* Inspector General\n* Privacy Program\n* Small Business\n\n#### Federal Government\n\n* The White House\n* USA.gov\n* Vote.gov\n\n  * Web Policies\n  * Privacy\n  * No Fear Act\n  * Whistleblower Protection\n  * Notice of EEO Findings of Discrimination\n  * Information Quality\n  * Open Gov\n  * Accessibility\n  * Vulnerability Disclosure Program\n\n", "frontpage": true}
