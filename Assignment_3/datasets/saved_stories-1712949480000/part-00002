This may be\nleading to restrictions on how much infrastructure can be used, given the\npower requirements.\n\nAWS users have informed The Register that there are sometimes limits on the\nresources that they can access in its Ireland bit barn, home to Amazon's eu-\nwest-1 region, especially with power-hungry instances that make use of GPUs to\naccelerate workloads such as AI.\n\n\"You cannot spin up GPU nodes in AWS Dublin as those locations are maxed out\npower-wise. There is reserved capacity for EC2 just in case,\" one source told\nus. \"If you have a problem with that, AWS Europe will point you at spare\ncapacity in Sweden and other parts of the EU.\"\n\nWe asked AWS about these issues, but when it finally responded the company was\nsomewhat evasive.\n\n\"Ireland remains core to our global infrastructure strategy, and we will\ncontinue to work with customers to understand their needs, and help them to\nscale and grow their business,\" a spokesperson told us.\n\nIreland's power grid operator, EirGrid, was likewise less than direct when we\nasked if they were limiting the amount of power datacenters could consume.\n\n\"EirGrid is responsible for the safe and secure operation of Ireland's\nelectricity transmission system. As part of its role, EirGrid supplies\nelectricity directly to Large Energy Users, which includes larger datacenters\nconnected directly to the transmission system,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"EirGrid may from time to time request Large Energy Users to reduce their\nenergy use as part of our Demand Side Management,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nIn other words, EirGrid does sometimes ask Large Energy Users to dial back\ntheir energy draw, but is declining to say explicitly if this has ever\ninvolved any of those bit barns.\n\nThis tiptoeing around the matter is perhaps understandable when datacenters\nhave been a success story for Ireland. There are more than 80 of them in the\ncountry, including a presence from all three of the big cloud operators \u2013\nGoogle, Microsoft, and Amazon \u2013 and these have brought employment and revenue\nto Ireland.\n\nAs the Irish Times wrote recently, the role of datacenters in the Irish\neconomy is a contentious issue, both inside and outside of government, and\npower consumption is just one of the reasons.\n\nAccording to Ireland's Central Statistics Office (CSO), power usage by\ndatacenters increased by 31 percent between 2021 and 2022, hitting 18 percent\nof the total metered electricity consumption.\n\nA recent report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that if\nunchecked, this could grow to 32 percent of Ireland's electricity by 2026.\nThis figure is disputed, however, with EirGrid stating that it assumed every\nfacility approved for connection to the power system would be completed and\noperating at full capacity in 2026.\n\n  * AWS severs connection with several hundred staff\n  * Amazon to lure upstarts with $500K in AWS AI credits each\n  * Amazon bends to Euro watchdogs, waives egress fees for folks ditching AWS\n  * Amazon goes nuclear, acquires Cumulus Data's atomic datacenters for $650M\n\nThe grid operator's own estimates are that datacenter power draw will reach\n25.7 percent of national electricity consumption \u2013 more than a quarter \u2013 by\nthis date. And that statement was a tacit admission that it will hit 32\npercent sometime in the near future.\n\nThe problem is wider than just AWS and Ireland. Power limitations may be\naffecting datacenters and their users in other parts of Europe and beyond.\n\n\"This is something I've been hearing more and more about recently and not just\nDublin,\" IDC Senior Research Director in EMEA Andrew Buss told The Reg. \"While\nAWS might be impacted it's broader than that.\"\n\n\"I've heard from implementers and consultants that for some Azure datacenters,\ncustomers are being given virtual machine startup quotas to limit how quickly\nnew demands and resource consumption can impact operations.\"\n\n## CEO of UK's National Grid warns of datacenters' thirst for power\n\nREAD MORE\n\nSome datacenter operators have also found that otherwise suitable sites have\nproven unviable because of a shortage of power, as it would take too long to\ndevelop the required power links for the anticipated workloads, Buss said.\n\n\"This is another reason why it is not feasible for most European organizations\nto close all their datacenters and migrate wholesale to the public cloud as\nthe capacity just is not there and won't be for decades,\" he added.\n\nAs reported last year, European bit barn operators are finding it harder to\nsecure reliable and cost-effective power, while just last month, the head of\nthe UK's National Grid warned that datacenter power consumption is on track to\ngrow 500 percent over the next decade.\n\nAnother analyst that asked to remain anonymous told us that Ireland,\nSingapore, and the Netherlands are all maxed out on available power for any\nnew datacenter builds so this isn't purely a European problem. In the US, new\nbuilds in Loudoun County in the state of Virginia will have restricted power\nas transmission lines capable of meeting their requirements have yet to be\nconstructed.\n\nSmall wonder that some datacenter operators are turning to drastic measures to\nsecure power for their facilities. AWS, for example, recently acquired one\nsited adjacent to a nuclear power plant in northeast Pennsylvania. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Amazon\n  * AWS\n  * Cloud Computing\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Amazon\n  * AWS\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Electricity\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AWS Graviton\n  * Azure\n  * Cloud native\n  * Content delivery network\n  * Digital Ocean\n  * Ebook\n  * EC2\n  * Edge Computing\n  * FinOps\n  * Fusion Power\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * G Suite\n  * Hybrid Cloud\n  * IaaS\n  * iCloud\n  * Kindle\n  * Kubernetes\n  * Multicloud\n  * Nuclear Power\n  * Paas\n  * Private Cloud\n  * Public Cloud\n  * S3\n  * Serverless\n  * Systems Approach\n  * Virtualization\n  * vSphere\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Jeff Bezos\n\n#### More about\n\n107 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Amazon\n  * AWS\n  * Cloud Computing\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Amazon\n  * AWS\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Electricity\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AWS Graviton\n  * Azure\n  * Cloud native\n  * Content delivery network\n  * Digital Ocean\n  * Ebook\n  * EC2\n  * Edge Computing\n  * FinOps\n  * Fusion Power\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * G Suite\n  * Hybrid Cloud\n  * IaaS\n  * iCloud\n  * Kindle\n  * Kubernetes\n  * Multicloud\n  * Nuclear Power\n  * Paas\n  * Private Cloud\n  * Public Cloud\n  * S3\n  * Serverless\n  * Systems Approach\n  * Virtualization\n  * vSphere\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Jeff Bezos\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Amazon to lure upstarts with $500K in AWS AI credits each\n\nCome on in, drill into Anthropic and Mistral \u2013 that's not the sound of a door\nslamming shut behind you\n\nAI + ML10 days | 1\n\n#### AWS severs connection with several hundred staff\n\n'Necessary,' 'focusing our efforts,' 'deliver maximum impact' ... sounds just\nlike all the other tech layoffs lately\n\nPaaS + IaaS9 days | 11\n\n#### AWS must pay $525M to cloud storage patent holder, says jury\n\nUpdated Computing giant will appeal ruling, which found infringement was not\n'willful'\n\nStorage1 day | 18\n\n#### Reducing the cloud security overhead\n\nWhy creating a layered defensive strategy that includes security by design can\nhelp address cloud challenges\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### GenAI will be bigger than the cloud or the internet, Amazon CEO hopes\n\nAnd Andy Jassy will happily take your money along the way\n\nOff-Prem18 hrs | 11\n\n#### US-EAST-1 region is not the cloudy crock it's made out to be, claims AWS\nEC2 boss\n\nIt's the region where stuff gets stressed at scale first, says Dave Brown, as\nhe plots variants of Amazon's Outposts\n\nPaaS + IaaS2 days | 4\n\n#### Amazon finishes pumping $4B into AI darling Anthropic\n\nAdds $2.75B to the ML sweepstakes ante and is counting on Claude\n\nAI + ML16 days | 3\n\n#### UK govt office admits ability to negotiate billions in cloud spending\ncurbed by vendor lock-in\n\nExclusive After slew of AWS deals signed under MoUs, CDDO says current\napproach might weaken its position\n\nPublic Sector8 days | 98\n\n#### Amazon fined in Europe for screwing shoppers with underhand dark patterns\n\nE-commerce titan to appeal sanction amounting to three hours of annual profit\n\nPersonal Tech14 days | 54\n\n#### Cloud vendor lock-in is shocking, but there's a get out of jail card\n\nOpinion We've done it once, we can do it again\n\nPublic Sector4 days | 73\n\n#### Microsoft hiring Inflection team triggers interest from EU's antitrust\nchief\n\nAll sorts of levers being pulled to lure AI developers from here, there,\neverywhere\n\nAI + ML7 days | 4\n\n#### Huawei's cloud unit is its current growth vehicle\n\nBig in China \u2013 and a presence elsewhere, but not at a scale to worry global\nhyperscalers\n\nOff-Prem10 days |\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
