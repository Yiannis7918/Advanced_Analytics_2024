Every law firm is\nlooking at the possibility of turning associates into super-associates, but\nthat isn\u2019t the entirety of the job. Part of the purpose of working at a law\nfirm is training, both for the associates and the partners. If associates see\ntheir skills whither, the legal profession may be worse off in the long run\ndespite the short-term productivity gain.\n\nOver the past few weeks, numerous practitioners managing their law firms have\nasked me what the proliferation of AI models means for the legal field and\ntheir training programs. How will associates improve? Will they become\ndependent on these tools and be worse practitioners over time? And will\nwriting patents by hand seem like teaching Navy sailors to navigate by the\nstars instead of GPS (which the military is actually doing!)\n\nThanks for reading Nonobvious!

This week in Nonobvious, we\u2019re going to talk about\na few of them and what the future might look like.\n\n##\n\nDigital Transformation for a Legal Education\n\nAs we previously covered, some of the most intriguing studies have shown that\nartificial intelligence, and large language models specifically, helps the\nleast experienced performers the most while making everyone significantly\nfaster, including legal professionals. These speed gains can be truly\nenormous\u2014one study from New Zealand conducted with senior attorneys found that\nLLMs performed certain tasks with high quality and a 99.97% reduction in task\ncompletion time. What this means is that new lawyers, who are often the\nbottleneck in producing patents, will be some of the greatest beneficiaries\nfor purposes of firm productivity. For more experienced practitioners, they\nwill benefit too; however, it will be more on the side of improving the speed\nwith which they draft, at least with where the technology is today. For\npractitioners at smaller firms, this can be the difference between drowning or\nthriving, while at big firms this means freeing up partner time to spend with\nclients or managing associates even if the drafting quality only goes up\nslightly. Either way, it is a win, but one with interesting training\nimplications.\n\nSubscribe to get Nonobvious every week.\n\nMost notably in the finance industry, bankers are already using AI to\naccelerate primarily the learning of their associates. What they are doing is\nhaving associates use AI for some portion of the tasks while working by hand\nto train with others. With new lawyers, using AI at least some of the time has\ntwo main benefits. The first is that associates are not just being trained in\nthe subject matter but also in the use of AI systems, which is the future of\nwork. But the other is that the AI effectively acts as a 1-1 tutor. Tutoring\nis wildly effective for education. A 1984 paper by Benjamin Bloom found that\nregular students who received tutoring performed 2-sigma higher than average,\nan observation today called the \u201cBloom Effect.\u201d This effect has been\nreplicated, for example with \u201ccognitive computer\u201d programs. This means that\nassociates get trained up faster. That said, you may still want to audit them\nby having them hand-write an application to ensure they are solidifying their\nlegal education through spaced repetition, a proven educational method for\nsolidifying understanding of long-term concepts.\n\nThe upshot of this accelerated learning is that by the end of the first year,\na 2nd year associate can do the work of a 3rd year associate, which means they\ncan even start to interface with clients earlier, bringing them into contact\nwith the real meat of the practice of law\u2014servicing the client and hearing\ntheir needs\u2014earlier than before. It also means that while a new lawyer\u2019s work\nmight look quite familiar, a mid-level associate\u2019s work might look quite\ndifferent than it did in the past, perhaps a little more like a junior\npartner. Their legal practice will involve more client communication and\nworking with AI systems more than completing routine tasks or rudimentary\nlegal research. In turn, this will help young practitioners more quickly\ndevelop a sense of the client\u2019s needs, the relationship between their work and\nlegal and business objectives, and a sense of taste.\n\nOne way to think about it is that the job of training a practitioner is\nactually composed of two parts: training them to be an associate for 2-3 years\nand then training them to be a partner for 3-5 more years. With new AI tools,\nthis instead becomes a single, long period of training to be a partner that\nlasts for their entire associate journey, but with a ramp-up period\naccelerated by generative AI.\n\nThe nature of legal work is going to change, which that means that the\ntraining needs to adapt too. While it is important to be able to write an\napplication by hand, the work if the future is editing as much as it is\nwriting from scratch. You may find that rather than teaching them some of the\nspecific word choices you prefer as a partner you are \u201cletting them in\u201d to\nyour job. Instead of editing their work, associates will work with partners to\ncollaboratively edit the work of the AI, which is effectively the associates\u2019\nown associates. While practical legal education focuses more on the practice\nof routine tasks to develop intuition, the future will more involve practicing\nthe higher-level work of focusing on client needs and legal outcomes from the\nstart. While previously the province of more senior associates and partners,\nthis will become part of training from Day One. Even as the use of generative\nAI and legal tech gets integrated into curricula by law schools, the practical\napprenticeship of an associate position is still important. New lawyers will\ncome into firms more trained on tools like Edge, just like they now come\ntrained to use search tools like LexisNexis or Westlaw. But it will still fall\non legal professionals to train new lawyers on the work of lawyering, which\nmeans working with clients and driving legal outcomes, not just answering\nquestions in IRAC form.\n\nOne Harvard Business Review paper also argues that part of training also\ninvolves reskilling middle or senior employees. It is important to remember\nthat generative AI is a very fast-changing field. There is no shame in relying\non tech-savvy associates to help partners in adopting technology. In fact,\npartners may want to leverage associates to come to decisions more quickly and\nevaluate tools more closely with the people who will be using them regularly.\n\nLaw firms may find that the use of case studies in specific training modules\nwill be faster, at least to start, than diving right in to using the tool on\nactual client matters. Typically, a law firm will begin training by throwing a\nyoung practitioner directly into client matters with strict supervision. With\ngenerative AI, the AI models themselves can be tutors and support automation.\nTherefore, preparing case studies that a young practitioner can start with may\nbe quite helpful. The benefit of using case studies is that this can also be\nused to bring more experienced practitioners up to speed who are less familiar\nwith AI models too at a rapid pace.\n\nThe future, in other words, may well be:\n\n  1. For younger employees, mix manual practice with AI-powered work\n\n  2. Check their work and show them how they could have edited AI output better\n\n  3. Train them to manage, edit, and be creative more than completing routine work\n\n  4. See how you can accelerate a 2nd year associate into 3rd year associate work earlier\n\n  5. Ensure training includes being AI-native tool users\n\nHow are you tackling this problem? We are interested in your view. We may\ncover some of the most interesting perspectives in a shout-out in next week\u2019s\nNonobvious.\n\n##\n\nPrior Art\n\nLast year, we talked about ARM and how it created the world\u2019s most voluminous\nchip business on the back of a patent licensing strategy. By avoiding capital\nexpenditure and investing purely in R&D, ARM has been able to dominate RISC\nchips in a world where efficiency, especially with energy, is king.\n\nThis week was a major one for ARM\u2019s strategy. After failing to catch fire in\nthe GPU market with their Mali products, everyone is looking for an\nalternative to Nvidia\u2019s expensive (and scarce) chips in AI. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are\nthe most popular chips by far for both training and running AI workloads, but\nthere is a sense that while GPUs are optimal for training they may not be for\nusing the model once it is already trained. Google announced a new ARM-based\nchip for AI inference workloads. This could be the breakthrough the industry\nhas been waiting for; a patent license-based chip could break through\nproduction bottlenecks by leveraging the manufacturing capacity of the many.\n\n##\n\nWeekly Novelties\n\n  * Pfizer and BioNTech won a stay in Moderna\u2019s patent infringement case against them while PTAB reviews challenges to two of the patents (Fierce Pharma)\n\n  * The Federal Circuit took up an interesting case on false marking: Crocs calls its products \u201cpatented\u201d but the only patents are design patents.
