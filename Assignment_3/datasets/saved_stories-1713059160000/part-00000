Signed on 20 July\n1936 at the Montreux Palace in Switzerland,^[4] it went into effect on 9\nNovember 1936, addressing the long running Straits Question over who should\ncontrol the strategically vital link between the Black and Mediterranean\nseas.^[5]\n\nThe Montreux Convention regulates maritime traffic through the Turkish\nStraits. It guarantees \"complete freedom\" of passage for all civilian vessels\nin times of peace. In peacetime, military vessels are limited in number,\ntonnage and weaponry, with specific provisions governing their mode of entry\nand duration of stay. If they want to pass through the Strait, warships must\nprovide advance notification to the Turkish authorities, which, in turn, must\ninform the parties to the convention.^[6]^[7]^[note 1] In wartime, if Turkey\nis not involved in the conflict, warships of the nations at war may not pass\nthrough the Straits, except when returning to their base.^[8] When Turkey is\nat war, or feels threatened by a war, it may take any decision about the\npassage of warships as it sees fit. The United States is not a signatory to\nthe Convention.^[9]\n\nWhile it was designed for a particular geopolitical context, and remains\nunchanged since its adoption, the Montreux Convention has endured as a \"solid\nexample of a rules-based international order\", since most of its terms are\nstill followed.^[10]\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nBosporus Strait\n\nDardanelles Strait\n\nThe convention was one of a series of agreements in the 19th and 20th\ncenturies that sought to address the long-running Straits Question of who\nshould control the strategically vital link between the Black Sea and\nMediterranean Sea. In 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne had demilitarised the\nDardanelles and opened the Straits to unrestricted civilian and military\ntraffic under the supervision of the International Straits Commission of the\nLeague of Nations.\n\nBy the late 1930s, the strategic situation in the Mediterranean had altered\nwith the rise of Fascist Italy, which controlled the Greek-inhabited\nDodecanese islands off the west coast of Turkey and had constructed\nfortifications on Rhodes, Leros and Kos. The Turks feared that Italy would\nseek to exploit access to the Straits to expand its power into Anatolia and\nthe Black Sea region. There were also fears of Bulgarian rearmament.^[11]\nAlthough Turkey was not legally permitted to refortify the Straits, it\nnonetheless did so secretly.^[12]\n\nIn April 1935, the Turkish government dispatched a lengthy diplomatic note to\nthe signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne proposing a conference to agree a\nnew regime for the Straits and requested that the League of Nations authorise\nthe reconstruction of the Dardanelles forts. In the note, Turkish Foreign\nMinister Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras explained that the international situation had\nchanged greatly since 1923. Europe had then been moving towards disarmament\nand an international guarantee to defend the Straits. The Abyssinia Crisis of\n1934\u20131935, the denunciation by Germany of the Treaty of Versailles and\ninternational moves towards rearmament meant that \"the only guarantee intended\nto guard against the total insecurity of the Straits has just disappeared in\nits turn\". Indeed, Aras said that \"the Powers most closely concerned are\nproclaiming the existence of a threat of general conflagration\". The key\nweaknesses of the present regime were that the machinery for collective\nguarantees were too slow and ineffective, and there was no contingency for a\ngeneral threat of war and no provision for Turkey to defend itself. Turkey was\ntherefore prepared to enter into negotiations with a view to arriving in the\nnear future at the conclusion of agreements for regulations of the regime of\nthe Straits under the conditions of security which are indispensable for the\ninviolability of Turkey's territory, in most liberal spirit, for the constant\ndevelopment of commercial navigation between the Mediterranean and the Black\nSea.\n\nThe 1915 \u00c7anakkale Bridge on the Dardanelles strait, connecting Europe and\nAsia, is the longest suspension bridge in the world.^[13]\n\nThe response to the note was generally favourable; Australia, Bulgaria,\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Japan, Romania, the Soviet Union, Turkey, the United\nKingdom and Yugoslavia attended negotiations at Montreux, Switzerland, which\nbegan on 22 June 1936. Two major powers were notably absent: Italy, whose\naggressively expansionist policies had prompted the conference, refused to\nattend, and the increasingly isolationist United States declined even to send\nan observer.^[14]\n\nTurkey, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union each put forward their own set\nof proposals, each aimed chiefly at protecting the proponent's own interests.\nThe British favoured the continuation of a relatively restrictive approach,\nthe Turks sought a more liberal regime that reasserted their control over the\nStraits and the Soviets proposed a regime that would guarantee absolute\nfreedom of passage. The British, supported by France, sought to exclude the\nSoviet fleet from the Mediterranean Sea, where it might threaten the vital\nshipping lanes to India, Egypt and the Far East.^[15] In the end, the British\nconceded some of their requests, but the Soviets succeeded in ensuring that\nthe Black Sea countries, including the Soviet Union, were given exemptions\nfrom the military restrictions imposed on non-Black Sea nations. The agreement\nwas ratified by all of the conference attendees with the exception of Germany,\nwhich had not been a signatory to the Treaty of Lausanne, and with\nreservations by Japan,^[16] and came into force on 9 November 1936;^[14] it\nwas registered with the League of Nations Treaty Series on 11 December\n1936.^[17]\n\nBritain's willingness to make concessions has been attributed to a desire to\navoid Turkey being driven to ally itself with or to fall under the influence\nof Adolf Hitler or Benito Mussolini.^[18]^[19] It was thus the first in a\nseries of steps by Britain and France to ensure that Turkey would either\nremain neutral or tilt towards the Western Allies in the event of any future\nconflict with the Axis.^[14]\n\n## Terms[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(June 2019) (Learn how and\nwhen to remove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nAs mentioned in its preamble, the Convention replaced the terms of the\nLausanne Treaty of 1923 as regards the Straits.^[20] This had dictated the\ndemilitarisation of the Greek islands of Lemnos and Samothrace, along with the\ndemilitarisation of the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmara and the Bosporus, and\nthe Turkish islands of \u0130mroz, Bozcaada and Tav\u015fan.\n\nThe Convention consists of 29 Articles, four annexes and one protocol.\nArticles 2\u20137 consider the passage of merchant ships. Articles 8\u201322 consider\nthe passage of war vessels. The key principle of freedom of passage and\nnavigation is laid out in articles 1 and 2. Article 1 provides, \"The High\nContracting Parties recognise and affirm the principle of freedom of passage\nand navigation by sea in the Straits\". Article 2 states, \"In time of peace,\nmerchant vessels shall enjoy complete freedom of passage and navigation in the\nStraits, by day and by night, under any flag with any kind of cargo\".\n\nThe International Straits Commission was abolished, thereby allowing the full\nresumption of Turkish military control over the Straits and the\nrefortification of the Dardanelles. Turkey was authorised to close the Straits\nto all foreign warships during a war or when it was threatened by aggression.\nAlso, Turkey was authorised to refuse transit from merchant ships belonging to\ncountries at war with it.\n\nA number of highly specific restrictions in Article 14 and 18 were imposed on\nwhat type of warships are allowed passage. Non-Black Sea powers wishing to\nsend a vessel must notify Turkey 15 days prior to the requested passing, and\nBlack Sea states must notify 8 days prior to passage. Also, no more than nine\nforeign warships, with a total aggregate tonnage of 15,000 tons, may pass at\nany one time. Furthermore, no single ship heavier than 10,000 tonnes can pass.\nAn aggregate tonnage of all non-Black Sea warships in the Black Sea must be no\nmore than 45,000 tons, with no one nation exceeding 30,000 tons at any given\ntime, and they are permitted to stay in the Black Sea for at most 21 days.\nOnly Black Sea states may transit capital ships of any tonnage, escorted by no\nmore than two destroyers. Any revision to articles 14 and 18 requires 3/4\nmajority of signatory countries and must include Turkey.^[21]^[22]^[23]^[24]\n\nUnder Article 12, Black Sea states are also allowed to send submarines through\nthe Straits with prior notice as long as the vessels have been constructed,\npurchased or sent for repair outside the Black Sea. The less restrictive rules\napplicable to Black Sea states were agreed as effectively a concession to the\nSoviet Union, the only Black Sea state other than Turkey with any significant\nnumber of capital ships or submarines.^[19]^[25] The passage of civil aircraft\nbetween the Mediterranean and the Black seas is permitted only along routes\nauthorised by the Turkish government.^[26]\n\nIn time of war, Turkey not being belligerent, warships of belligerent Powers\nshall not pass, except to return to their base. (art. 19)\n\n## Implementation[edit]\n\nThe terms of the convention were largely a reflection of the international\nsituation in the mid-1930s. They largely served Turkish and Soviet interests\nby enabling Turkey to regain military control of the Straits and assuring\nSoviet dominance of the Black Sea.^[26] Although the Convention restricted the\nSoviets' ability to send naval forces into the Mediterranean Sea, which\nsatisfied British concerns about Soviet intrusion into what was considered a\nBritish sphere of influence, it also ensured that outside powers could not\nexploit the Straits to threaten the Soviet Union. That was to have significant\nrepercussions during World War II when the Montreux regime prevented the Axis\npowers from sending naval forces through the Straits to attack the Soviet\nUnion.^[citation needed] The Axis powers were thus severely limited in naval\ncapability in their Black Sea campaigns and relied principally on small\nvessels that had been transported overland by rail and canal networks.\n\nAuxiliary vessels and armed merchant ships occupied a grey area, however, and\nthe transit of such vessels through the straits led to friction between the\nAllies and Turkey. Repeated protests from Moscow and London led to the Turkish\ngovernment banning the movements of \"suspicious\" Axis ships with effect from\nJune 1944 after a number of German auxiliary ships had been permitted to\ntransit the Straits.^[27]^[28]\n\n### Aircraft carriers[edit]\n\nAlthough the Montreux Convention is cited by the Turkish government as\nprohibiting aircraft carriers from transiting the Straits,^[29] the treaty\nactually contains no explicit prohibition on aircraft carriers. However,\nmodern aircraft carriers are heavier than the 15,000-ton limit imposed on\nwarships, which makes it impossible for non\u2013Black Sea powers to transit modern\naircraft carriers through the Straits.\n\nUnder Article 11, Black Sea states are permitted to transit capital ships of\nany tonnage through the straits, but Annex II specifically excludes aircraft\ncarriers from the definition of capital ship. In 1936, it was common for\nbattleships to carry observation aircraft. Therefore, aircraft carriers were\ndefined as ships that were \"designed or adapted primarily for the purpose of\ncarrying and operating aircraft at sea\". The inclusion of aircraft on any\nother ship does not classify it as an aircraft carrier.\n\nThe Soviet Union designated its Kiev-class and Kuznetsov-class ships as\n\"aircraft-carrying cruisers\" because the ships were armed with P-500 and P-700\ncruise missiles, which also form the main armament of the Slava-class cruiser\nand the Kirov-class battlecruiser. The result was that the Soviet Navy could\nsend its aircraft-carrying cruisers through the Straits in compliance with the\nconvention, but at the same time, the Convention denied access to NATO\naircraft carriers, which exceeded the 15,000-ton limit.^[30]^[31]^[32]^[33]\nWhile the Soviet Union built its aircraft-carrying cruisers in the Black Sea,\nneither the Soviet Union nor Russia has ever based them in the Black Sea.\n\nTurkey chose to accept the designation of the Soviet aircraft carrying\ncruisers as aircraft cruisers, as any revision of the convention could leave\nTurkey with less control over the Straits, and the UN Convention on the Law of\nthe Sea had already established a more liberal passage through other straits.\nBy allowing the Soviet aircraft-carrying cruisers to transit the Straits,\nTurkey could leave the more restrictive Montreux Convention in place.^[33]\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n### Istanbul Canal[edit]\n\nIf it comes to fruition, the long-proposed Kanal Istanbul (Istanbul Canal)\nproject could, according to Turkey, circumvent the Montreux Convention in the\n21st century and allow greater Turkish autonomy with respect to the passage of\nmilitary ships, which are limited in number, tonnage, and weaponry, from the\nBlack Sea to the Sea of Marmara. The canal project would involve building a 45\nkm (28 mi) artificial waterway through Thrace to connect the Sea of Marmara\nwith the Black Sea.^[34] That route would run nearly parallel to the Bosporus,\nbut ships transiting it would arguably not be subject to the terms of the\nMontreux Convention.^[35] Currently, the Dardanelles is heavily congested with\nshipping and there are long waits to pass through the Bosporus. The Kanal\nproject's stated purposes are to speed up shipping and boost revenue by\nproviding an alternate maritime route.^[10]^[36]\n\nIn January 2018, the Turkish Prime Minister and a former Transport Minister,\nBinali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, announced that the Kanal would not be subject to the terms of\nthe Montreux Convention.^[37] That announcement was received negatively by the\nRussian media and government, and many have disputed the Turkish government's\ninterpretation of the convention.^[38]^[39]\n\n### Soviet Union[edit]\n\nThe convention was repeatedly challenged by the Soviet Union during World War\nII and the Cold War. As early as 1939, Joseph Stalin sought to reopen the\nStraits Question and proposed joint Turkish and Soviet control of the Straits,\ncomplaining that \"a small state [Turkey] supported by Great Britain held a\ngreat state by the throat and gave it no outlet\".^[40] After the\nMolotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact was signed by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany,\nSoviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov informed his German counterparts\nthat the Soviet Union wished to take military control of the Straits and to\nestablish its own military base there.^[41]\n\nThe Soviets returned to the issue in 1945 and 1946, demanding a revision of\nthe Montreux Convention at a conference excluding most of its signatories;\ntheir demands included a permanent Soviet military presence and joint control\nof the Straits. These demands were firmly rejected by Turkey, despite an\nongoing Soviet \"strategy of tension\". For several years after World War II,\nthe Soviets exploited the restriction on the number of foreign warships by\nensuring that one of theirs was always in the Straits, thus effectively\nblocking any state other than Turkey from sending warships through the\nStraits.^[42] Soviet pressure expanded into a full demand to revise the\nMontreux Convention, which led to the 1946 Turkish Straits crisis and Turkey\nabandoning its policy of neutrality. In 1947, Turkey became the recipient of\nUS military and economic assistance under the Truman Doctrine of containment\nand joined NATO along with Greece, in 1952.^[43]\n\n### United States[edit]\n\nThe United States has not signed the convention but has generally complied\nwith it.^[23] The passage of US warships through the Straits has also raised\ncontroversy, as the convention forbids the transit of non-Black Sea nations'\nwarships with guns of a calibre larger than eight inches (200 mm). In the\n1960s, the US sent warships carrying 420 mm calibre ASROC missiles through the\nStraits, prompting Soviet protests. The Turkish government rejected Soviet\ncomplaints, pointing out that guided missiles were not guns and that, since\nsuch weapons had not existed at the time of the convention, they were not\nrestricted.^[44]\n\nAccording to Jason Ditz of Antiwar.com, the Montreux Convention is an obstacle\nto a US naval buildup in the Black Sea because of the stipulations regulating\nwarship traffic by nations not sharing a Black Sea coastline.^[45] The US\nthinktank Stratfor has suggested that those stipulations place Turkey's\nrelationship to the US and its obligations as a NATO member in conflict with\nRussia and the regulations of the Montreux Convention.^[46]\n\n### Militarisation of Greek islands[edit]\n\nThe Convention annulled the terms of the earlier Lausanne Treaty on the\nStraits, including the demilitarisation of the Greek islands of Lemnos and\nSamothrace. Turkey recognised Greece's right to militarise them via a letter\nsent to the Greek Prime Minister on 6 May 1936 by the Turkish Ambassador in\nAthens, Ru\u015fen E\u015fref. The Turkish government reiterated this position when the\nTurkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, R\u00fc\u015ftu Aras, in his address to the\nTurkish National Assembly on the occasion of the ratification of the Montreux\nTreaty, recognised Greece's legal right to deploy troops on Lemnos and\nSamothrace with the following statement: \"The provisions pertaining to the\nislands of Lemnos and Samothrace, which belong to our neighbour and friendly\ncountry Greece and were demilitarised in application of the 1923 Lausanne\nTreaty, were also abolished by the new Montreux Treaty, which gives us great\npleasure\".^[47]\n\nAs the relationship between Greece and Turkey deteriorated over the following\ndecades, Turkey denied that the treaty affected the Greek islands and sought\nto bring back into force the relevant part of the Lausanne Treaty on the\nStraits.^[48]^[49]\n\n### 1994 reforms[edit]\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which entered\ninto force in November 1994, has prompted calls for the Montreux Convention to\nbe revised and adapted to make it compatible with UNCLOS's regime governing\nstraits used for international navigation. However, Turkey's longstanding\nrefusal to sign UNCLOS has meant that Montreux remains in force without\nfurther amendments.^[50] Furthermore, even if Turkey ratified UNCLOS, the\nMontreux Convention would continue to govern passage in the Straits given its\nstatus as a \"long-standing international convention\" under Article 35(c) of\nUNCLOS.\n\nThe safety of vessels passing through the Bosporus has become more of a\nconcern in recent years as the volume of traffic has increased greatly since\nthe convention was signed: from 4,500 ships passing through in 1934 to 49,304\nby 1998. As well as the obvious environmental concerns, the Straits bisect the\ncity of Istanbul, with over 14 million people living on its shores, and so\nmaritime incidents in the Straits pose a considerable risk to public safety.\nThe Convention does not, however, make any provision for the regulation of\nshipping for the purposes of safety or environmental protection. In January\n1994, the Turkish government adopted new \"Maritime Traffic Regulations for the\nTurkish Straits and the Marmara Region\" to introduce a new regulatory regime\n\"to ensure the safety of navigation, life and property and to protect the\nenvironment in the region\" but without violating the Montreux principle of\nfree passage. The new regulations provoked controversy when Russia, Greece,\nCyprus, Romania, Ukraine and Bulgaria raised objections. However, they were\napproved by the International Maritime Organisation on the grounds that they\nwere not intended to prejudice \"the rights of any ship using the Straits under\ninternational law\". The regulations were revised in November 1998 to address\nRussian concerns.^[51]\n\n### Russo-Ukrainian War[edit]\n\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Ukrainian\ngovernment appealed to Turkey to exercise its authority under the Montreux\nConvention to limit the transit of Russian warships from the Mediterranean to\nthe Black Sea. At least six Russian warships and a submarine had crossed the\nTurkish straits in February.^[52] After initial reluctance, attributed to the\ncountry's close ties with both Russia and Ukraine,^[52] Turkish Foreign\nMinister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu announced on 27 February that his government would\nlegally recognise the Russian invasion as a \"war\", which provides grounds for\nimplementing the convention with respect to military vessels.^[8] This\nblockage of naval vessels also applies to NATO powers who cannot now move\ntheir vessels from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. However, \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu\nreiterated that pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Turkey cannot block\nRussian warships based in the Black Sea from returning to their registered\nbase.^[52] Around 27\u201328 February, Turkey refused permission for three out of\nfour Russian warships to enter the Black Sea as their home base was not on the\nBlack Sea.^[53]\n\nUp until 2022, Russia had deployed its Kilo-class submarines from the Black\nSea to the Mediterranean, arguing that these vessels were ultimately destined\nfor \"maintenance\" at facilities in the Baltic Sea. There was criticism of this\nsince the submarines would then remain deployed in the Mediterranean for an\nextensive period of time. Since this was becoming more difficult to justify,\none analysis in May 2022 suggested that the Russians may have found a work-\naround to the problem, potentially using the country's internal waterways to\npermit transit to vessels up to the size of the Kilo-class boats between the\nBlack Sea and the Baltic. The ability to use the internal waterways to\nfacilitate such a transit has yet to be confirmed.^[54]\n\nTwo Russian Federation ships (the missile cruiser Varyag, the flagship of the\nRussian Pacific Fleet, and Admiral Tributs, a large anti-submarine destroyer)\nwaited in the Mediterranean seeking to enter the Black Sea for nine months. In\nOctober 2022, they were refused permission and left the Mediterranean Sea\nthrough the Suez Canal.^[55]\n\nOn 2 January 2024 Turkey refused passage through the strait to two minehunters\ndonated by the British Royal Navy to the Ukrainian Navy pursuant to the\nConvention.^[56]\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Defined as warships displacing more than 100 tons but not above 10,000 tons.\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Convention regarding the Regime of the Straits\" (PDF).
