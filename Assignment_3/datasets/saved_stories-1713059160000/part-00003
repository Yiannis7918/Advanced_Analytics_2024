I was a solo, non-technical, first-time founder, pre-product, pre-\nteam, without an impressive resume or connections to the investors I wanted.\n\nNevertheless, our seed round accomplished everything we needed. Our round was\nway oversubscribed and we ended up raising $3m from over 50 of the best angels\nin the world, like Garry Tan, Tim Ferriss, Eric Ries, Balaji Srinivasan, plus\nfounders of Figma, Flexport, Replit, Intercom, Thumbtack, Lambda School,\nOutschool, and a lot more.\n\nAs a lucky bonus, we also did it right before the crash, which means we got a\nvery favorable valuation, which means that not only do we have a lot of\nrunway, but we retained a lot of equity for our team.\n\nMy fundraising strategy was somewhat different than I\u2019ve seen described\nelsewhere, and I think it\u2019s a particularly useful framework for founders who\ndon\u2019t have a strong pre-existing personal network. Enough people have asked me\nabout my approach that I figure it's time to write it down.\n\n#### The problem\n\nWhen the idea for Mentava was coming together, I found myself in a situation\nfamiliar to many first-time founders:\n\n  1. I wanted to raise money\n  2. I specifically wanted to raise money from top-tier angels because they also provide credibility, experience, personal networks, and often large audiences on social media\n  3. I didn\u2019t have close personal relationships with famous investors (or a large social media audience, or a reputation as a thought leader, or a degree from Harvard or Stanford, or a job at a FAANG)\n\n#### The solution: Intro-driven fundraising\n\nAs a solo founder still in the process of building a team, boosting our\ncompany\u2019s credibility via top-tier angels was my primary fundraising goal. One\nof the first things I did was to make a spreadsheet of 50 dream angels whom I\nreally wanted on my cap table.\n\nAs I began looking for connections to those investors, I began to see that\npitch quality doesn\u2019t improve along a sliding scale. It\u2019s much more about\ncrossing a tipping point: Investors don\u2019t want to waste their high-status\nfriends\u2019 time by passing along a weak or even merely good startup. But they\nvery much want to do their friends a favor by getting them into a hot,\noversubscribed deal.\n\nFor an intro-driven fundraise to work, you have to be so good that investors\nfeel like they\u2019re doing their friend a favor by introducing you.\n\n#### Shortcuts make long delays\n\nAs I began reaching out to angels, I was optimistic about my chances. Our no-\ncode pilot was going well (teaching 2-year-olds to read at a 2nd grade level)\nand I\u2019d accepted a few checks from friends and family. If I could land an\ninvestment from a big-name investor it would dramatically accelerate the rest\nof the fundraise.\n\nDespite a nagging feeling that it was still too soon, I reached out to a well-\nknown investor on Twitter.\n\nWe had some friendly back-and-forth chats, but they politely declined without\neven a call.\n\nI kicked myself for letting my impatience get the best of me. There was no\nexcuse for not waiting until I had some decent momentum and a proper warm\nintro. On the bright side, regret over that mistake helped me avoid any other\nreckless shortcuts for the rest of the raise.\n\n#### Imposter syndrome is real\n\nAfter blowing that opportunity, I needed to know: How big was the gap between\nmy current ability to tell Mentava\u2019s story, vs the quality bar I needed to\nhit?\n\nI recorded my pitch and shared it around for feedback. For me, this was the\nmost uncomfortable part of the entire fundraise. Critical feedback from a\npersonal friend bothers me way more than a rejection from a potential investor\nI\u2019ve only talked to for a few minutes. I started to worry about my current\ninvestors: \u201cWhat if seeing my lousy pitch shakes their confidence in me? What\nif they think \u2018why did we just fund this incompetent guy\u2019?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what my actual investors had to say about my pitch when they saw it:\n\n\u201cWeird and jarring\u201d\n\n\u201cYour face looks like you\u2019re angry\u201d\n\n\u201cA bit weird\u201d\n\n\u201cFeels a little bit forced\u201d\n\nThere was constructive feedback too, of course, but it was clear I had a long\nway to go. I postponed any intro calls with well-known investors and began\npitching only less-established investors while I focused on improving my\nstory.\n\n#### Pitching is storytelling\n\nThe questions potential investors asked on those calls, plus the feedback I\u2019d\nalready received, helped me figure out where my storytelling was the weakest.\nThe biggest gaps fell into three main categories: inability to explain our\nproduct, a weak narrative arc, and poor presentation skills.\n\n#### Ok, but what is the product?\n\nThe most common question I got was \u201cOk, but what is it? What specifically are\nyou building?\u201d This turned out to be a frustratingly difficult question for me\nto answer well.\n\nSometimes superior products are the result of thousands of cumulative design\ndecisions that compound on each other to create something transformational.\n(What\u2019s the opposite of \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d?) Imagine trying to explain\nexactly why Marvel\u2019s movies would transform the superhero genre, before any of\nthem had been made.\n\nI spent weeks trying to summarize Mentava in a single sentence that explained\nwhat made us different. I iterated through so many bad, clunky explanations\nlike:\n\nMentava is a 30-minute daily online program that trains kids to teach\nthemselves though gamified learning experiences\n\nMentava is a 30-minute daily online program for guided self-learning practice,\nthrough gamified learning experiences\n\nMentava teaches self-learning through guided practice of online education\n\nMentava offers practice for self-teaching, using educational games optimized\nfor accelerated learning\n\nIn the end, what finally worked was when simply I gave up trying to describe\n\u201cwhat Mentava is\u201d and instead described \u201cwhat Mentava is doing\u201d:\n\nAt Mentava, we:\n\n  1. Train kids to teach themselves and become independent learners\n  2. Provide software that lets them learn at their own, accelerated pace\n\nWhen I used that explanation during calls, I could see things finally click\ninto place for potential investors. And since they now understood the longer-\nterm vision, I could get more specific about our near-term product roadmap\nwithout confusing them. \u201cOur first product will be a learn-to-read app for 2-\nand 3-year-olds.\u201d\n\n#### Paint a better future\n\nAnother problem I had was over-focusing on the problems we were solving. I see\nMentava\u2019s emphasis on addressing root cause issues (e.g. lowered expectations,\ndemand for equal outcomes, signaling and credentialism) as a major\ndifferentiator, but spending too long talking about them made me seem negative\nand pessimistic.\n\nPeople want to be inspired by visions of a happy future, and I got much better\nresponses once I spent less time dwelling on the shortcomings of modern\neducation policy and more time exploring the possibilities of a post-Mentava\nworld.\n\n#### Presentation skills matter\n\nOne nice thing about fundraising over video calls is that I could practice my\nstory on camera and see exactly how it would look to investors. I learned to\nalways take investor calls at a standing desk, with good lighting and my\ncamera at eye level. I kept my notes in a small window directly under my\nwebcam to simulate eye contact as much as possible, and if I had a\nteleprompter available I absolutely would have used it. I\u2019m still tempted to\nrig one up for our next round.\n\nWhile watching my practice recordings, I also experienced how easy it is to\nzone out when watching me talk. I learned to vary my pitch, pace, and pauses\nto emphasize key points. I added cues in my speaking notes to remind myself to\nsmile and be more expressive. Watching myself, I could see how much more\nengaging my stories became with more variance in vocal inflection and facial\nexpression.\n\n#### Test and iterate\n\nAs uncomfortable as the original feedback was, it was also the fastest path to\nimprovement. And while I\u2019m sure my first investors got a little worried when\nthey had to tell me that my pitch was \u201cweird and jarring\u201d, I felt good about\ndemonstrating my ability to course-correct.\n\nThe next time those same investors saw my pitch the reception was more\npositive:\n\n\u201cgosh this is 100x better niels. Thank you for iterating. Not only is the\ncontent tighter, you\u2019re more specific about the product, and your passion and\nemotion shows thru\u201d\n\n#### Full throttle\n\nIn the end, I spent 4 months figuring out how to tell Mentava\u2019s story\neffectively, and crafting that arc into a slide deck that could tell the story\nwithout me present. I knew my pitch would need to be perfect to stand out\namongst the deal flow that top investors get, so I didn't go after them until\nI could consistently close every intro.\n\nOnce I was consistently closing every call, I finally started accepting intros\nto investors on my dream list and the rest of the fundraise moved really fast.\nFrom that point on, it took about 4 weeks of full-time fundraising to fill our\nround with 50+ investors.\n\nThe fundraise flywheel looked like this:\n\n  1. Create spreadsheet of dream investors\n  2. Ask friends if they know anyone who might know anyone on the list\n  3. Request intros to the people most likely to say yes\n  4. Send friend a forwardable intro email including a link to slide deck\n  5. If investor accepts the intro, send them a Calendly link for a video call\n  6. Close investor, send them a link to our RUV (via AngelList)\n  7. Ask investor who they can intro to from the spreadsheet\n\nRepeat steps 3-7 until round is full\n\n#### Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon\n\nIntro-driven fundraising is essentially a high-stakes game of Six Degrees of\nKevin Bacon. How do you reach your desired investors in the minimal number of\nhops?\n\nFor example, one of the people at the top of my list was Tim Ferriss.\nMentava\u2019s mission is to teach kids to teach themselves, so Tim\u2019s passion for\nself-education was a perfect fit. And his massive audience would be a\ntremendous asset when the time came for us to get our story out.\n\nIt took three hops to find an introduction to Tim: first an angel that I cold-\nmessaged on Twitter, who introduced me to a second angel, who introduced me to\nTim.\n\nOne particularly busy investor required 7 independent warm intros from\ndifferent people before I was able to make contact!\n\n#### Ask for the money\n\nOne painful mistake that I made in my early calls was not closing solidly\nenough. My discomfort in pushing for specifics while on the call turned into\nweeks of email tag, trying to get a commitment on a specific dollar amount,\nand then managing the back-and-forth of the actual fund transfer.\n\nAfter a few failures, I learned to push through the discomfort and ask for a\nspecific dollar amount while still on the call. And then further followed up\nthat dollar amount with \u201cPerfect! I\u2019ll send you an RUV link to handle the\ninvestment. And I\u2019m trying to finalize allocations ASAP, how soon do you think\nyou could take care of it?\u201d\n\n#### Cat-herding\n\nEven after all the commitments had been made, I wasn\u2019t prepared for the amount\nof cat-herding required to wrangle the actual money transfers. I had to\nnavigate family offices, personal assistants, busy schedules, legal reviews,\nmis-sent wires, unanswered emails, and so on.\n\nEvery couple days I\u2019d send out a new message, reiterating how hot our round\nwas and trying to instill a sense of urgency:\n\n\u201cQuick update: [big name investor(s)] just invested! The round is filling up\nand I\u2019d really like to get you in. Let me know if you\u2019re having any problems\nwith the link!\u201d\n\nIt was a huge relief when the final check came in.\n\n#### Send the slide deck first\n\nIn the end, I closed 80%-90% of the angels I talked to. One reason my close\nrate was so high was that I always sent a thorough slide deck before the call.\nIt covered all the standard investor talking points: mission, team, pricing,\ncustomer acquisition, traction, moat, etc. Since I\u2019d spent so long iterating\non it, I knew my deck told Mentava\u2019s story as effectively as I did in person.\n\nBecause the slide deck already told our whole story, the actual calls were\nfrequently just a formality. In fact, several angels sent money without ever\ntalking to me. If an angel wasn\u2019t interested, they would just decline the\noriginal email intro, which saved us both from wasting our time.\n\n#### Angels vs funds\n\nI should also say that I talked to a number of funds during this process, and\nmy success with angels was exactly mirrored by a string of strikeouts with\nVCs. I\u2019m reluctant to draw too many conclusions from my sample size of one\nfundraise, but in general the vibe I got was that angels were looking for\nreasons to say \u201cyes\u201d, and VCs were looking for reasons to say \u201cno\u201d.\n\nAlongside many other concerns, lots of funds were apprehensive about investing\npre-team or pre-product, some thought what we were doing was impossible, and\nsome were simply a values mismatch. The exceptions were Quiet and Floodgate,\nwho both understood our vision instantly and were thrilled to support us at\nsuch an absurdly early stage. You rock!\n\n#### Summary\n\nWhen people ask me what fundraising was like, I can genuinely say that I found\nit pretty fun. Every rejection surfaced a new flaw in how I was telling\nMentava\u2019s story, and it was satisfying to chip away at those weaknesses little\nby little. There were a few stumpers that I really struggled with (like the\naforementioned \u201cyes but what is it\u201d question) and it was particularly\ngratifying each time I finally figured one out.\n\nWhat I found was that the fundraising journey wasn\u2019t about the growth of the\ncompany\u2019s bank account. The journey was about the growth of new skills: from\nbeing a lousy storyteller to telling Mentava\u2019s story in a way that inspires\npeople.\n\nAnd that\u2019s important because all the investor calls I took were just the\npractice round for what really matters: hiring. Getting so many mistakes out\nof the way in front of investors left a lot fewer mistakes for me to make in\nfront of candidates.\n\nSo if you\u2019re passionate about education, I\u2019d be happy to personally tell you\nabout Mentava\u2019s vision for the future: where parents can send their kids to\nwhatever school they want, be part of their local school community, have them\nsurrounded by a group of peers their own age, and still know that their kids\ncan access a world-class STEM education. We\u2019re hiring!\n\n\u2190 All posts\n\n  * Home\n  * about\n  * Teachers\n  * Schools\n  * Districts\n  * Mission\n  * PROGRAM\n  * CONTACT\n  * support\n  * BLOG\n  * JOBS\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024.
