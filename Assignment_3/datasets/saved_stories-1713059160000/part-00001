Today, the\nfamily-run business is an unlikely juggernaut and one of the most outspoken\ncompanies in America. Here\u2019s how Dr. Bronner\u2019s is rewriting the playbook for\ncorporate success by doubling down on its vibey values.\n\nBy Carrie Battan\n\nPhotography by Shaughn and John\n\nJune 15, 2023\n\nThis story was featured in The Must Read, a newsletter in which our editors\nrecommend one can\u2019t-miss GQ story every weekday.

They\u2019ve shown\nup to a fairly standard-looking suburban office park to be initiated into\ntheir standard-sounding roles in -liquid-soap production, shipping, and\nregional sales. But the normalcy ends quickly on Planet Bronner. They park\ntheir cars in a sea of solar-powered electric-vehicle chargers and then walk\npast a company-tended garden, where fruits and vegetables are anyone\u2019s for the\ntaking. Inside, they are greeted warmly\u2014and perhaps thrown off guard a bit\u2014by\nthe Dr. Bronner\u2019s welcome wagon, a crew of impossibly upbeat humans who can\nbest be described as vibey. These cultural ambassadors, when they are not\nplanning their annual Burning Man pilgrimages, wear tie-dye mechanic coveralls\nand drive around Dr. Bronner\u2019s HQ blasting disco from a psychedelically\noutfitted fire truck. They call themselves the Foamy Homies.\n\nThe new hires make their way to a conference room for their employee-\nonboarding session, where they have been prompted by the Foamy Homies to\nintroduce themselves by showing off their preferred dance moves while a fog\nmachine pumps vaporous clouds into the room. By the time this fresh crop of\nDr. Bronner\u2019s employees hears from the company\u2019s CEO, David Bronner\u2014who long\nago revised the abbreviation to stand for Cosmic Engagement Officer\u2014they have\nrealized that this will not be a standard manufacturing gig at all.\n\nWATCH\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the All-One path,\u201d announces David\u2014who uses he/they pronouns\u2014standing\nbefore the group, referring to the sweeping ideology coined by their eccentric\ngrandfather, Emanuel Bronner. Emanuel, who possessed no advanced degree but\nwas undeterred in adopting a physician\u2019s title, founded Dr. Bronner\u2019s Magic\nSoaps in the late 1940s, in large part because he wanted to broadcast his\nideas about unifying the human race, and his All-One dicta are still printed\non the brand\u2019s soap-bottle labels. In the early years of the company, Dr.\nBronner\u2019s was a genuine grassroots operation\u2014a cult-favorite brand passed, if\nnot directly from the hands of Emanuel himself, among hippies camping out in\nvans at places like Woodstock. Emanuel would distribute his product by\npromising a free bottle of soap to anyone who would show up to listen to him\nproselytize the All-One message.\n\nTwo generations later, Dr. Bronner\u2019s has vastly outgrown its quirky, humble\norigins and become the top-selling natural soap brand in North America. The\ncompany now sells not only its liquid soap but highly successful lines of\nbalms, toothpastes, coconut oil, and hand sanitizers, in addition to newly\nlaunched chocolates that were immediately hailed by gourmands as a premium\nproduct. Today, the iconography of its labels\u2014and Emanuel\u2019s far-out\nmessaging\u2014is imprinted firmly in the psyche of the American consumer. And yet,\neven as so many Americans have come to possess a fondness for the soap, the\nraw numbers around the success of Dr. Bronner\u2019s\u2014over $170 million in revenue\nin 2022\u2014are still kind of staggering. Especially staggering, maybe, to the\ncustomers who\u2019ve been affectionately buying its signature minty formula since\nthe days of the natural-product boom of the \u201960s and \u201970s. Emanuel\u2019s grandsons\nDavid and Michael now preside over an empire in which a bottle of Dr.\nBronner\u2019s soap is sold every two seconds or so.\n\nBut perhaps more notable than the company\u2019s sheer growth is the durability of\nEmanuel\u2019s founding ethos, the All-One ideology that the family still suffuses\ninto every element of the business. All-One\u2014and its attendant Moral ABC\u2014is the\nquasi-religious doctrine that was the very reason for the existence of Dr.\nBronner\u2019s original soap bottles, which served as vessels for his beliefs. If\nyou are ever bored in the shower, you can give yourself an extensive education\nin the chaotic, zealous, AND EXCLAMATION POINT\u2013FILLED! All-One philosophy via\nthe tiny text on the labels. Boiled down to its essence, All-One has a pretty\nunimpeachable and evergreen mandate: \u201cIn all we do, let us be generous, fair &\nloving to Spaceship Earth and all its inhabitants,\u201d Emanuel wrote. \u201cFor we\u2019re\nALL-ONE OR NONE!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this messaging that has helped gird the family with an ethical framework\nto weather the forces\u2014globalization, rapid growth, incessant corporate buyout\noffers\u2014that have perennially threatened to undermine its mission. Most Dr.\nBronner\u2019s products are produced and packaged at the company\u2019s headquarters in\nSouthern California, which is home to factory space filled with refinery\nequipment and high-tech bottling devices. Just around the bend from the new-\nemployee onboarding session sits a group of massive industrial tanks filled\nwith the coconut, olive, and palm kernel oils used for Dr. Bronner\u2019s liquid\nsoaps.\n\nDavid Bronner, at 50, is lanky, lumbering, and low-talking, but has a brain\nthat moves quickly. David is eager to talk about their spirituality and makes\nreference to \u201cthat mystical Christian\u201d deep inside. Within a few minutes of\ntaking the microphone at employee orientation, David will discuss more\nexistentially heavy topics with this group of strangers than most people will\naddress with their spouses over the course of a lifetime.\n\nMichael, left, and David Bronner, who now run the soap business founded by\ntheir grandfather, at work in the company\u2019s Southern California headquarters.\n\nDr. Bronner\u2019s has always been a family company, and present among the new\nemployees and the Foamy Homies is David\u2019s younger brother and the company\u2019s\npresident, Michael Bronner. On the periphery of the room is their brother-in-\nlaw Michael Milam, the company\u2019s COO, a brainy and straitlaced numbers guy\nwith degrees in business and theology. And in the corner sits the matriarch,\nthe company\u2019s long-running CFO, Trudy Bronner, Michael and David\u2019s 79-year-old\nmother. A Christian and a conservative, Trudy married into the family\u2014and,\neventually, the business\u2014when she wed Emanuel\u2019s late son Jim in 1968. Today\nshe gazes upon the scene with a faintly absent look that indicates she has\ngrown desensitized to the idiosyncrasies of her eldest child. David is now\ntalking about their spiritual journey and the idea of the divine. \u201cWhen you\u2019re\nready,\u201d David tells the group, \u201cthe divine is going to meet you.\u201d\n\nThe other topics David covers include, but are not limited to: their\ngrandfather\u2019s failings as a father. Their Christian-Reaganite upbringing. The\nphilosophical awakenings they experienced as a student at Harvard in the \u201990s.\nThe hypocrisy of the criminal justice system. The promise of regenerative\norganic agriculture. The prolonged legal battle that Dr. Bronner\u2019s waged\nagainst the DEA after the company reformulated its liquid soap to include hemp\nseed oil in 1999. The production of olive oil in the context of the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict. The trip they took to Amsterdam after college, and,\nperhaps most crucially, the spiritual rebirth experienced there by way of\npsychedelics.\n\nThe trip was so mind-blowing that David has since made it their life\nmission\u2014and eventually the company\u2019s\u2014to drive efforts in the United States to\nlegalize psychedelics, and more broadly, end the drug war. And they have\nsucceeded, in spite of any skepticism and unease that some colleagues might\nhave toward this trippy streak. In 2021 the company spent over $4.4 million on\ndrug and psychedelics policy reform efforts, part of which helped pass a\nColorado ballot measure last year to decriminalize certain psychedelics.\n\nBy the time David starts talking about metaphorical ego death and coming face-\nto-face with Jesus while under the influence of psychedelics, everyone in the\nroom has become pretty inured to the far-out nature of the spiel. \u201cAll of a\nsudden I\u2019m talking to God, and I\u2019m like, Wait a minute. If this love is real,\nand this is true, then why does it suck so bad? Why are there people being\nmurdered and raped, and all of the worst stuff? Seeing the allness of it\nall...\u201d David trails off. \u201cAnd then seeing Jesus stepping in, just calm and\ncompassionate. Not trying to explain, not trying to complain, just stepping\nin.\n\n\u201cI was like, Wow, I want to be like that,\u201d they continue. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re\nhere to do. We\u2019re here to serve. We\u2019re part of the divine that can activate\nthe divine, and stop that aggression and oppression and make peace on earth.\u201d\n\nCan a soap company activate the divine? Dr. Bronner\u2019s has succeeded at\nrealizing so many seemingly unfeasible visions over the last quarter century\nthat it is not outside of the realm of possibility. Three decades ago, when\nDr. Bronner\u2019s was a super-minty soap brand remembered fondly by washed-up\nhippies, all of this highfalutin talk was mostly still just talk. But in the\nyears since Emanuel Bronner\u2019s progeny took over the business, Dr. Bronner\u2019s\nhas quietly but self-assuredly evolved beyond its humble origins to become a\nlegitimate titan of the beauty and cleaning industries as well as a household\nstaple. The brand no longer relies on hippies passing Bronner\u2019s bottles\nbetween VW vans, seeing as how Gwyneth Paltrow and Meghan Markle openly\nprofess their love for the lavender soap.\n\n\u201cMost brands and companies our size sell out to some soulless conglomerate\nthat has not a lot of ethics in the world,\u201d David Bronner says. \u201cWe get to\nrock it how we want here.\u201d\n\nGrowth is one thing, but Dr. Bronner\u2019s has managed to become a major player in\nits market while painstakingly encoding its ethics into every step of the\nproduction process. In fact, it could be argued that Emanuel Bronner predicted\nthe current era of ethically minded business, and certainly ethically minded\nmarketing. And now the humble soap brand finds itself at the vanguard of every\nphilosophical and logistical question that American entrepreneurs are\ngrappling with right now. All of its good deeds\u2014from rigorously engineered\nfair trade supply chains to charitable donations and environmentally minded\nmanufacturing\u2014are thoroughly cataloged in the Dr. Bronner\u2019s annual public\naccountability report card, the All-One! Report.\n\nThese ideals are built into the complex corporate architecture of Dr.\nBronner\u2019s\u2014a certified Benefit Corporation as of 2015\u2014and an agreement between\nDavid and Michael ensures that the business won\u2019t be sold off to a global\nconglomerate anytime soon. It\u2019s a fate that\u2019s befallen so many household-name\nnatural health and food brands, many of which began to flourish in the same\nera following the late-\u201960s counterculture revolution that Dr. Bronner\u2019s did.\nIt may seem easier than ever to stock your cabinets with granola-y,\nrighteously sourced products, but that\u2019s only because they\u2019ve been subsumed\ninto the old corporate model: Tom\u2019s of Maine is now Colgate-Palmolive. Burt\u2019s\nBees is Clorox. Trader Joe\u2019s is operated by the Albrechts, the family behind\nAldi. And Bragg\u2014of apple cider vinegar fame\u2014was recently acquired by an\ninvestor group that included Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom. Perhaps the only\nother business similar in scale and ethical ambition is Patagonia, the company\nso steadfastly resistant to the conventional corporate model that its founder\nand his family transferred the company\u2019s ownership into a trust and nonprofit\norganization last year to insulate it from the forces of capitalism.\n\n\u201cMost brands and companies our size sell out to some soulless conglomerate\nthat has not a lot of ethics in the world,\u201d David reminds the group. \u201cWe get\nto rock it how we want here. Soap, work hard, rock that product, and\nthen...joy. Drop the joy in there, make sure we\u2019re having fun while doing good\nin the world and making good products.\u201d\n\nIn this obscenely scam-ridden day and age, it is reasonable to assume that\nanyone sermonizing like this in the realm of business is one false step away\nfrom being exposed as a charlatan. But the Bronners genuinely do seem to, in\nthe parlance of thought-leadership conferences, walk the walk. The combination\nof Christian clemency and drug-induced ego surrender is potent. The\nexecutives, despite ranging from the conservative to the progressive, have all\nagreed to cap their own executive salaries at five times the lowest-paid fully\nvested Dr. Bronner\u2019s employees, which means they cannot earn more than about\n$300,000 per year. It\u2019s a policy that frees up funds for a waterfall of annual\ncharitable donations and, more importantly, an enviable company culture for\nits over 300 workers. Dr. Bronner\u2019s boasts the sort of employee benefits that\nwould make Bezos shudder, including a health-insurance policy with company-\npaid premiums, bonuses, free daily vegan lunches prepared by the Foamy Homies,\naccess to therapy, and, as of 2022, coverage of ketamine-assisted mental\nhealth treatment.\n\n### Pulling Weeds with Chris Black\n\nColumnist Chris Black weighs in on hot topics in culture, with the occasional\nrant about life as a person who had fun in his twenties.\n\nThis bouquet of life-changing employee benefits is probably why, on the day of\ntheir initiation, the new employees of Dr. Bronner\u2019s seem rapt by David\u2019s\npontification. They gamely participate in the celebratory session and erupt\nwith applause when David wraps up their spiel.\n\n\u201cWe just get to live the dream here,\u201d David says. \u201cThanks for joining the\nteam. Right on.\u201d\n\nThere is one person present who can bring everyone down to earth a bit and\nremind the crowd that this, after all, is a job. This reminder arrives when\nDavid\u2019s mother, Trudy, takes the lectern. \u201cWe do a lot of good, and we think\nwe treat you right. And we expect you to work hard,\u201d she says. She points to a\ncluster of six core principles of Dr. Bronner\u2019s that have been printed onto\nthe wall behind her. \u201cEvery time I give a tour to little kids, it\u2019s like,\nWhat\u2019s the first thing you have to do to be a successful person, really?\nThat\u2019s the work hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are an unusual company,\u201d she adds, speaking almost as if she is addressing\nher sons as much as these new employees. \u201cNot every day will you have an\nexperience like you had today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to be joint-interviewed with my brother,\u201d Michael explains with\na grin after the onboarding session, as we sit down at a picnic table outside.\n\u201cI love my brother, and we can rap back and forth, but when he\u2019s telling the\nstory and I\u2019m waiting for my chance to interject, he pivots to psychedelics.\nLike, no, we\u2019re not talking about the 1960s!\u201d\n\nMichael is 48 and, in spite of the tie-dye T-shirt he\u2019s wearing today, is more\nbuttoned up than David. He says they are \u201c85 percent the same,\u201d but the\ndifferences are meaningful. Warm, thoughtful, and possessed by so much nervous\nenergy that he\u2019s capable of pacing seven miles over the course of a day while\ntaking phone calls, Michael tells me that he\u2019s just started watching\nSuccession. He cannot help but laugh at the family business of it all. (\u201cIt\u2019s\nexactly what I don\u2019t want to be,\u201d he says.) There are, of course, imperfect\nparallels to be spotted between the two families, chiefly the trio of siblings\ngrappling with the future of their family business. (Michael and David\u2019s\nsister, Lisa, will arrive at headquarters later today.) Michael has a lightly\nadversarial relationship with his older sibling that mostly manifests as\nMichael affectionately trying to get a word in edgewise. But now, alone, he\nholds the floor, and he has plenty worthwhile to say.\n\nWe are ostensibly here to discuss his role as president of the company, but\nany discussion of Dr. Bronner\u2019s inevitably turns into a remembrance of family\nlore. \u201cI grew up with my grandfather being the man on the mountain,\u201d Michael\ntells me. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I could literally understand Shakespeare that I\ncould understand the depths of what he was talking about.\u201d\n\nDr. Emanuel Bronner loved aphorisms and slogans. The sermonizing soap bottles\nwere so endemic to the Bronner brand that David eventually figured out how to\ncreate labels that wouldn\u2019t disintegrate in the shower. Today, the fine print\nof the label has become so iconic that it is often used in memes by people who\nwant to signify that a rant is taking place.\n\nBronner\u2014who adopted the \u201cDr.\u201d title in his 30s\u2014had good reason to fight for\nunity. Born into a family of Jewish soap-makers, he immigrated to the US from\nGermany in his early 20s, just over a decade before his own parents were\nkilled in the Holocaust. As a young man, he began sharing his grandiose\nambitions to unify the human race, preaching a little too vehemently for some\npeople\u2019s liking. He was committed to Elgin State Insane Asylum, from which he\neventually escaped. Once he settled in Southern California, he got in the\nhabit of lecturing in LA\u2019s Pershing Square and doling out bottles of soap to\nhis audience. When he realized some in his crowds were grabbing his soap\nwithout actually listening to his disquisitions, he began printing the Moral\nABC on the label.\n\nDecades later, after he\u2019d gradually gone blind\u2014a development he attributed to\nelectroshock therapy he\u2019d received as a young man\u2014Emanuel was still single-\nmindedly fixated on the Moral ABC. When his small grandchildren came to visit\nhim, he\u2019d quiz them on these principles. \u201cHe would basically lecture us with\nour feet dangling off the couch as if we were PhDs in comparative religion,\u201d\nsays Michael. \u201cWe\u2019d be looking at the cracks in the ceiling, and he\u2019d ask us,\n\u2018What\u2019s the 13th?\u2019 \u2018All-One, Grandpa!\u2019 \u201d\n\nEmanuel Bronner, pictured in 1978, began his company hoping to spread the\nquasi-religious ideology he called All-One, not to sell soap.\n\nDavid Covey/Courtesy of Dr. Bronner\u2019s\n\nThat the company would stay in the family was hardly a foregone conclusion.\nEmanuel\u2019s wife died young, and his sons, Jim and Ralph, were relegated to the\nfoster system while Emanuel fervently promoted his All-One message. Jim\nremained semi-estranged from his father for most of his life. It was only when\nhis sons and Trudy began to handle the Dr. Bronner\u2019s company that Emanuel\u2019s\nambitious vision could be translated into a formidable business model. Even\nwithout his father\u2019s consistent physical presence, Jim inherited a passion for\ncharity and a sense of feverish ingenuity. When he and Trudy took over the\ncompany\u2014which had been in financial disrepair\u2014they set about eventually\ntransferring about a third of the business\u2019s worth over to the Boys and Girls\nClub of Escondido in the form of a large plot of land.\n\nYears later, Jim\u2019s child David traveled their own circuitous path to the soap\nbusiness. In 1997, in the aftermath of their Amsterdam awakening, David became\na parent and moved back to California. They were toying with an idea that had\nonce seemed preposterous: joining the family company. A year later, Jim died\nof lung cancer and David found themself in charge of Dr. Bronner\u2019s, which was\nstill operating out of Jim and Trudy\u2019s home. Michael joined two years later.\nWhen the two set out to acquire a line of lip balms, they knew they needed\nsomeone a bit more logistically oriented to helm operations. They called\nMichael Milam, husband of youngest Bronner sibling, Lisa, and recruited him to\nmove across the country and run production. Today he remains a key executive\nand a sensible counterweight to David and Michael. \u201cI\u2019m here because they\ntrust me, and because I don\u2019t think like them. They needed someone who...who\nknows how to close a drawer, I\u2019ll just say it that simply,\u201d Milam tells me\nwryly. \u201cThe Bronner blood needs to marry into people who can close drawers.\u201d\n\nBack when Jim married Trudy, he was partnering with someone who could close a\ndrawer. It was Trudy, a former math teacher, who became the company\u2019s de facto\nbookkeeper in the late \u201980s, sorting out the haphazard finances and logistics.\n\u201cThere were just boxes of stuff, randomly thrown together,\u201d she remembers.\n\u201cThere was no oversight, no direction.... I\u2019m not an accountant or a CPA, but\nsince I was good with numbers, that was how I became the CFO.\u201d\n\nAnyone who knew Trudy in those days would not have predicted her gradual\nwarming to the drug-reform movement. Trudy had long treated her son\u2019s crusade\nfor psychedelics with a healthy skepticism. You won\u2019t find her dropping acid\nanytime soon. (Trudy puts it bluntly: \u201cThis is not my thing.\u201d) And yet she was\nable to open herself up to ideas about criminal justice reform and psychedelic\ntherapy when David showed her a fresh angle on the topic. They told the\nfamily: \u201cLook, I know you think I just want to go to Burning Man and take\npsychedelics, but this is really helping veterans,\u201d David remembers. \u201cPretty\nearly on, they understood that this is actually life-saving medicine. It\u2019s not\njust so David can go party.\u201d David might be the psychedelic guru of the bunch,\nbut it was Michael who pushed his mother even further ideologically. It was\ndeep into COVID, and even though Dr. Bronner\u2019s was doing more sales than\never\u2014everyone wanted soap\u2014Michael found himself in a depressive hole that\ncouldn\u2019t be fully treated by antidepressants. David suggested he try ketamine-\nassisted therapy, and it worked. When he passed that information along to his\nmother, he says she took on a new understanding of psychedelic therapy.\n\n\u201cI want to see decriminalization too,\u201d Michael says. \u201cBut for David, it could\nbe assumed that there\u2019s an ulterior agenda for him. He wants a lot of these\nthings to be legalized because he wants to be able to do them freely.\u201d\n\nMichael was able to get his mother\u2019s blessing on rolling out the ketamine\nbenefits to their employees. During this process, she was tuned even closer to\nDavid\u2019s frequency. \u201cShe even surprised me,\u201d David says. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Yeah,\nwe gotta end the drug war.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen I ask Trudy about psychedelics later, I expect her to bristle, but she\ndoesn\u2019t. \u201cIf it can help people, then more power to it. I\u2019m willing to\nlisten,\u201d she says. Then she hearkens back to a story she told me earlier about\nsports coaches describing David as the most \u201ccoachable\u201d athlete they\u2019d ever\nworked with. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m coachable too,\u201d she says.\n\nAt one point, I ask David how the company\u2019s new factory workers tend to feel\nabout all the woo-woo of the business. They tell me a story. When they arrived\nat the company, David says, they came in with big ideas. They were on fire,\nready to hire a workforce composed of activists. Their father quickly\ndisabused them of the notion. \u201cHe was like, \u2018You need to humble yourself,\u2019 \u201d\nDavid says. \u201cIt\u2019s a Mexican American and Catholic workforce.\u201d Then Jim asked\nhis child what the most important part of the company was. David responded:\nThe soap, the causes, the customers? Jim rebuffed them. \u201cHe was like, No. No.\nNo. It\u2019s the employees.\u201d\n\nThen David returns to another parable. \u201cSomeone asked a janitor at NASA, \u2018What\nare you doing?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m helping put a man on the moon.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Bronner family offers employees progressive benefits that include free\nvegan lunches and support for ketamine-assisted mental health treatment.\n\nPeople love to grouse that we don\u2019t make anything in America anymore. Instead,\nwe rely on grandiose ideas, clever marketing, and unorthodox CEOs to lather up\nexcitement toward whatever speculative vision is in fashion at any given\nmoment. This is part of the reason why American entrepreneurship has fallen\ninto its current identity crisis: We are so detached from the reality of\nmaking things that we\u2019re relegated to the fantasy-lands of founders. We are so\nsusceptible to being hoodwinked by charismatic entrepreneurs peddling\nunfulfillable promises that even the richest and most powerful elites can be\nswindled by a 30-year-old cryptocurrency idealist. There\u2019s an entire genre of\nstreaming television dedicated to scammer CEOs. In the company\u2019s formative\nyears, Emanuel openly admitted that the soap was merely a vessel for his All-\nOne message. But a bit like the mythology- and marketing-minded founders of\ntoday, Emanuel Bronner didn\u2019t always live up to the virtuous ideals he\npromoted: In 1988, his son and daughter-in-law cleaned up a massive tax mess\nhe\u2019d left that had put him in bankruptcy. Later, when Emanuel\u2019s grandchildren\ntook over the company, they discovered that the soap was not as natural as the\nlabel had advertised. Fixing his shortcomings was a massive undertaking. But\nit meant that the Bronner children and grandchildren learned some serious\nlessons about how to make good on ethical business promises\u2014-lessons that many\ncorporations and investors are having to grapple with these days. \u201cFirst and\nforemost, we needed to make sure the myth of my grandfather matched the actual\nproduct,\u201d Michael Bronner remembers. They launched a yearslong process of\nremoving artificial coloring and certifying their soaps as organic.\n\nGiven the virtuosic advertising sensibility that the Bronners have in their\nDNA, it would be easy to assume that marketing is a major expense in their\nbusiness. And yet, they have historically spent very little on conventional\nadvertising. They don\u2019t need to: David knows the value of a good stunt.\nWhether it\u2019s caging themself with hemp plants in front of the White House or\nhelping fund a hotline for people to call when they\u2019re having bad trips, David\nunderstands the inherent value of messaging. David\u2019s title may be Cosmic\nEngagement Officer, but they also double as de facto marketing guru, working\nto benefit the company as well as causes David believes in.\n\nAnd yet, behind all the generous charitable donations and the employees\u2019\ninterest in Burning Man, Dr. Bronner\u2019s remains at its core a company that\nmanufactures a product that people love. Every step in the supply chain and\nassembly line has been painstakingly optimized to ensure that the soap is the\ncleanest, most ethical, and efficacious version it can possibly be. And all of\nthe Bronner children, through the enthusiasms of their patrilineage and the\ndecades of work experience they\u2019ve had at the company, are intimately\nacquainted with every minute detail of their soapy birthright.\n\nOne afternoon, I tour the factory spaces with Michael Bronner and his sister,\nLisa. Lisa is Michael Milam\u2019s wife, and perhaps the most straight-and-narrow\nof the siblings. She runs Going Green, the company\u2019s educational blog, where\nshe advises readers on how to best clean stainless steel or wash a dog with\nDr. Bronner\u2019s products. Together, the pair reminisce about the days when their\nfather used to show up unsolicited and offer to help put out forest fires or\ncontain fumes from chemical spills with the magic foam he\u2019d invented. \u201cArea\nMan shows up to fight forest fire with foam,\u201d Michael says, still amused and\nin awe of his father\u2019s antics.\n\nJim\u2019s kooky ingenuity is still deep in the blood of the Bronners, who like to\ngeek out over the subject of soap. As we walk into the main production\nbuilding, Lisa explains the factory\u2019s soap reactors, which, thanks to\nexpanding sales, keep being upsized. The new reactor, at 7,000 gallons, is so\nmassive that the family had to cut a hole in the ceiling of the factory space\nand crane it into the building. \u201cSoap is such a simple, simple reaction,\u201d Lisa\nsays. \u201cYou could totally do this in your kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy brother was in a science fair in third grade, and he made soap out of\ncigarette ashes and butter. The poor judges had to wash with it. It does wash,\nbut it leaves a really nasty smell,\u201d Michael explains. \u201cCooking over a fire\nwas when the first soaps were made. The fat from the meat would drip into the\nashes.\u201d\n\nThis story originally appeared in the Summer issue of GQ.

For a few moments, it\u2019s as if the two have been\ntransformed into children invited to Willy Wonka\u2019s factory, delighting in each\nsensory detail of the complex machinery and the magical products they\nmanufacture in front of their very eyes.\n\nLisa tells us about an article she read recently about a woman who\u2019d been\nburied in highly alkaline soil two centuries ago. \u201cThey exhumed her, and her\nbody had turned into soap,\u201d on account of a reaction with fats in the human\nbody.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d Michael says, \u201cis how I want to go.\u201d\n\nCarrie Battan is a writer in New York.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the June/July 2023 issue of GQ\nwith the title \u201cHippie Soap Opera\u201d\n\nSubscribe to GQ >>>\n\nRelated Stories for GQBest of GQLong ReadsProfilesThe Must Read\n\nRead More\n\n  * Style\n\nThese Affordable Watches Are Loaded with Vintage-Inspired Details\n\nBy Cam Wolf\n\n  * GQ Recommends\n\n9 Dreamy Comforters That Wrap You Up in Coziness\n\nBy Tyler Chin\n\n  * Wellness\n\nGut Microbiome Tests Promise Full-Body Optimization\u2014Should You Try One?\n\nBy Hannah Singleton\n\n  * Style\n\nNike and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Are About to Drop the Spring's Sickest Trail\nSneakers\n\nBy Adam Cheung\n\n## GQ COUPONS\n\nWayfair Coupon\n\n20% off $250 spend w/ Wayfair coupon code\n\nMichaels Coupon\n\nMilitary Members save 15% Off - Michaels coupon\n\nASOS Promo Code\n\nEnjoy 30% Off w/ ASOS Promo Code\n\nEbay Coupon\n\neBay coupon for +$5 Off sitewide\n\nPeacock TV Promo Codes\n\nEnjoy Peacock Premium for Only $1.99/Month Instead of $5.99\n\nSamsung Discount Code\n\n$100 discount on your next Samsung purchase* in 2024\n\nSince 1957, GQ has inspired men to look sharper and live smarter with its\nunparalleled coverage of style, culture, and beyond.
