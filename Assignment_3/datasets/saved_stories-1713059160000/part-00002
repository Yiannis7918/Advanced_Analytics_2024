Although the upgraded ebikes look exactly the same, they\u2019ve\nbeen re-engineered in almost every aspect, says the company\u2019s co-CEO Eliott\nWertheimer.\n\nWhile this is just the beginning of VanMoof\u2019s lengthy relaunch, the ability to\nsell bikes directly once more \u201crepresents an enormous milestone for us as a\ncompany,\u201d Wertheimer told TNW.\n\nBefore declaring bankruptcy, VanMoof had been making major losses on its\nebikes for years. The high-tech, proprietary parts that made the bikes so\nappealing \u2014 but meant they could only be serviced by VanMoof itself \u2014 proved\nto be the company\u2019s Achilles heel.\n\nThe <3 of EU tech\n\nThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder\nBoris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox.\nSign up now!\n\nOvernight, hundreds of thousands of riders across the world were left with a\nsoftware-heavy bike worth thousands of euros that could not be fixed or\nupgraded anywhere.\n\n## Getting VanMoof back on track\n\nThankfully, for those (if any?) still loyal to the VanMoof brand, the company\nwas bought out of administration three months later. The new owner is LaVoie,\nan e-scooter maker that falls under McLaren Applied, an offshoot of the\nBritish motorsport racing business.\n\nLaVoie inherited the tough task of putting a cash-hungry brand with a load of\nangry customers back on track.\n\nReleased yesterday, the refreshed S5 and A5 models include new firmware that\nhas fixed some bugs and improved connectivity between the bike and the\nsmartphone app. On the hardware side, the ebikes have more robust\nwaterproofing, a stronger motor bracket, and a new saddle connector to prevent\nthe seat from lowering as you ride.\n\nThe ebikes also include some new features including a light that blinks when\nyou decelerate and the option to configure the rear light to indicate as you\nturn.\n\nThe bikes now on sale were either made from scratch or are refreshed versions\nof existing bikes that were sitting with resellers or creditors.\n\nMcLaren Applied has been directly involved in testing these new bikes. And\ninstead of being shipped directly from the factory to customers, as used to be\nthe case, each bike must go through two quality control centres before going\non sale.\n\n\u201cWe chose to upgrade the five series because it is still a super reliable\nproduct with tech that\u2019s years ahead of any competitor,\u201d said Wertheimer, who\nused to hold the same position at LaVoie prior to the merger.\n\nVanMoof\u2019s new management chose to discontinue the 3 and 4 series because of\n\u201cdeep-rooted\u201d serviceability issues.\n\nAside from the bikes themselves, the new owners have revamped almost every\naspect of the brand\u2019s business model.\n\n## Rebuilding trust\n\nServicing is no longer carried out at VanMoof stores, but at a series of\napproved dealerships that now numbers 80 across the Netherlands, Germany,\nBelgium, France, and the UK.\n\nOwners of the 3 series and beyond can repair their bikes at these new centres.\nEveryone else will have to hope a mechanic has the expertise to fix their\nbikes. To this end, VanMoof has made servicing manuals for the 1 and 2 series\npublicly available.\n\nThe new S5 and A5 models retail for \u20ac3,298. They are only available for now to\ncustomers that are close to service shops, which are mainly in the Netherlands\nand Germany. However, sales are expected to expand to more European countries\nover the next month or so.\n\n\u201cPerhaps our biggest priority right now is expanding our network of partners\nso that new and existing owners can get their bikes repaired and serviced,\u201d\nWertheimer said.\n\n\u201cDelivering a reliable service will be crucial to building back trust in the\nbrand.\u201d\n\nHowever, VanMoof is still a complex bike reliant on proprietary parts. And\ncompetition from startups with similar offerings like Belgium\u2019s Cowboy or\nEstonia\u2019s Ampler Bikes is stiffer than ever.\n\nNevertheless, you\u2019ve got to admire the progress VanMoof\u2019s owners have made so\nfar. In less than a year, they\u2019ve managed to resume delivering spare parts,\nopen dozens of third-party service centres, and now restart ebike sales.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, we wanted to take the magic of riding VanMoof bikes and\ncouple that with a better customer experience, after-sales servicing, and\nreliability,\u201d Wertheimer said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go but I think we are definitely headed in the\nright direction.\u201d\n\n## Story by Si\u00f4n Geschwindt\n\nSi\u00f4n is a reporter at TNW.
