up to $20,000 in\ninterest for millions of borrowers\n\nPublished Mon, Apr 8 202410:06 AM EDTUpdated Mon, Apr 8 20244:28 PM EDT\n\nAnnie Nova\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * President Joe Biden\u2019s new plan to \u201ccancel runaway interest\u201d on student loans may reach as many as 25 million borrowers.\n  * It is the provision that might prove to be the most wide-reaching of the president\u2019s revised relief program, which he hopes will stand up to any legal challenges this time.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden speaks as he announces a new plan for federal student\nloan relief during a visit to Madison Area Technical College Truax Campus, in\nMadison, Wisconsin, U.S, April 8, 2024.\n\nKevin Lamarque | Reuters\n\nPresident Joe Biden unveiled his new plan to forgive student debt on Monday,\nless than a year after the Supreme Court blocked his initial attempt.\n\n\u201cToday too many Americans, especially young people, are saddled with\nunsustainable debts in exchange for a college degree,\u201d Biden said from an\nevent in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nBiden wants this aid package to survive any legal challenges. As a result, the\npresident has made the program narrower by targeting specific groups of\nborrowers for debt forgiveness, including those facing financial hardship.\n\nBut one of the provisions under the new plan could still reach up to 25\nmillion Americans. That\u2019s Biden\u2019s intent to \u201ccancel runaway interest.\u201d\n\nMore from Personal Finance: Why gas is so expensive in California Credit card\nusers face \u2018consequences\u2019 from falling behind After Biden praises progress on\ninflation, economists weigh in\n\n## Interest provision may erase up to $20,000 per borrower\n\nConsumer advocates have long criticized the fact that interest rates on\nfederal student loans may exceed 8%, which can make it tough for borrowers who\nfall behind or are on certain payment plans to reduce their balances.\n\nMore than 25 million federal student borrowers owe more than they originally\nborrowed, according to the Biden administration.\n\nIt estimates that, if its new plan is enacted as proposed, borrowers will get\nup to $20,000 of unpaid interest on their federal student debt forgiven,\nregardless of their income.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO1:0801:08\n\nPres Biden: Today\u2019s decision closed one path, now we are going to push through\nanother\n\nClosing Bell: Overtime\n\nCertain low- and middle-income borrowers may benefit even more.\n\nSingle people who earn $120,000 or less, and married borrowers making $240,000\nor under, could have the entire amount of interest that has accrued on their\ndebt since they entered repayment canceled under Biden\u2019s plan.\n\nBorrowers would need to be enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan to\nqualify but shouldn\u2019t have to apply for the relief.\n\n\u201cStudent debt interest capitalization has been keeping families from accessing\ntheir version of the American Dream,\u201d said Jaylon Herbin, director of federal\ncampaigns at the Center for Responsible Lending. \u201cErasing that debt will\nlessen the burden of student loan debt on millions of borrowers and allow them\nto pay off their loans in a timely manner.\u201d\n\n## Who may benefit from new forgiveness plan\n\nIn addition to the cancellation of interest, Biden\u2019s new plan is also expected\nto forgive the debt of certain groups of borrowers, including those who:\n\n  * Are already eligible for debt cancellation under an existing government program but haven\u2019t yet applied\n  * Have been in repayment for 20 years or longer on their undergraduate loans, or over 25 years on their graduate loans\n  * Attended schools of questionable value\n  * Are experiencing financial hardship\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear yet how financial hardship will be defined, but it\ncould include those burdened by medical debt or high child care expenses, the\nBiden administration said.\n\nBiden originally attempted to cancel people\u2019s student debt through executive\naction, but he\u2019s now turned to the rulemaking process. The next step in that\nprocedure is for the Biden administration to issue a proposed rule on its\nplan, which will be followed by a public comment period.\n\nThe president hopes to begin forgiving student debt before the November\nelection.\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
