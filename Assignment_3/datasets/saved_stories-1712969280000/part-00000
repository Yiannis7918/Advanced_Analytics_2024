Mearsheimer proffered what at first glance might\nappear to be a radical solution to the crisis in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI think what has to be done here,\u201d said Mearsheimer, \u201cis that we have to\nbasically sever the West\u2019s security relationship with Ukraine. It is just not\nenough to say \u2018Ukraine will not become part of NATO.\u2019 We have to completely\nsever our security relationship with Ukraine so that the Russians feel\nsomewhat secure that the West is not going to surreptitiously try and make\nUkraine a de facto member of NATO.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond, we should push Ukraine immediately to start serious negotiations with\nthe Russians, so that they end up only losing the territory that they have\nalready lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe great danger,\u201d he continued, \u201cis that if this war continues and we\ncontinue to threaten to bring Ukraine into NATO, what we are doing is giving\nthe Russians a greater and greater incentive to take more of Ukraine and to\nmake Ukraine more of a dysfunctional rump state so that if it ever did become\na part of NATO, it would not be a serious threat to Russia. So what NATO\nshould do right now is make it clear that Ukraine is not coming into NATO and\nthat Ukraine is on its own to work out a security relationship with Russia.\u201d\n\nTo no one\u2019s surprise, NATO seems intent on pursuing the exact opposite of what\nMearsheimer counsels. Only last week it was reported that NATO secretary-\ngeneral, Jens Stoltenberg, is seeking to create a $100 billion fund to\ncontinue to arm Ukraine. Still more, the \u2018Mission to Ukraine\u2019 plan would grant\nNATO operational control over the Ramstein Group, the US-led consortium that\noversees military supplies to Ukraine. Such a move, according to one unnamed\ndiplomat who spoke to the Financial Times, said such a move would be \u201ccrossing\na Rubicon. Nato will have a role in coordinating lethal support to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThough the general, albeit begrudging, consensus is that Ukraine is now badly\nlosing the fight, the war seems to be entering an even more perilous phase,\nwith Ukraine\u2019s plausible (though far from proven) involvement in the Crocus\nCity Hall terror attack and its continuing series of attacks inside Russia and\non Russian oil refineries.\n\nAs such, Mearsheimer\u2019s call to sever US security ties makes eminent sense \u2013\nand indeed may be one of Ukraine\u2019s only hopes for a future in Europe.\n\nIndeed, one could argue that Ukraine has wasted a decade\u2019s worth of valuable\ntime in the years following the 2014 Maidan coup. The subsequent Russian\nannexation of Crimea and the formation of the People\u2019s Republics of Luhansk\nand Donetsk might have been better seen as an opportunity for the country and\nits ethno-nationalist minded elites in the Western part of the country. Wiser\nheads in Washington and Brussels (if there were any) might have counseled Kiev\nthat their interests would not be served in fighting a war over the\noverwhelmingly Russian part of the population in the eastern and southern\nregions of the country. After all, it was those regions that formed the core\nbloc of voters for the Party of Regions, a bloc that Kiev\u2019s western-backed\nelites had repeatedly tried, beginning with the Orange Revolution in 2004, to\ndisenfranchise.\n\nThere was little guarantee a civil war would bring an end to the unrest\nsparked by the bloody coup that took place on the Maidan, much less\nreconciliation. There were, however, rather better odds it would bring ruin,\nand eventually, as did happen, the Russians. Ceding the disputed territories,\nabandoning NATO membership, working out a bilateral security treaty with the\nKremlin and focusing on meeting the requirements to join the EU would have\nbeen the more sensible path.\n\nBut Kiev made the fatal mistake of listening to Washington and the\nneoconservative and liberal interventionists who run things and who prove,\nwith each passing mid-adventure, the truth of Henry Kissinger\u2019s axiom that \u201cIt\nmay be dangerous to be America\u2019s enemy, but to be America\u2019s friend is fatal.\u201d\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is right, for Ukraine\u2019s sake, the Western-funded proxy war\nshould end, and Ukraine should seek, on a strictly bilateral basis, a\nnegotiated settlement with Moscow. An escalation of the war is in no one\u2019s\ninterest, least of all Ukraine\u2019s.\n\nJames W.
