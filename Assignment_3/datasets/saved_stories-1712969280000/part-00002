We present a framework based on mathematical billiards, wherein\nparticles remember their past trajectories. Despite its deterministic rules,\nsuch a system is strongly nonergodic and exhibits intermittent statistics and\ncomplex pattern formation. We show how these features emerge from the dynamic\nchange of topology. Our work illustrates how the dynamics of a single-body\nsystem can dramatically change with spatial memory, laying the groundwork to\nfurther explore systems with complex memory kernels.\n\n  * Received 1 January 2024\n  * Accepted 20 March 2024\n\nDOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.157101\n\n\u00a9 2024 American Physical Society\n\n#### Physics Subject Headings (PhySH)\n\n  1.

A particle moves\nballistically from the initial condition (x0,\u03b10) where x0 is the initial\nposition vector and \u03b10 is the initial angle. The particle elastically reflects\non the boundaries and its own trajectories, creating a line segment of length\nli, where i\u2208[1,\u221e) is the number of segments. The particle moves until it self-\ntraps in a singular point, where the total length of the trajectory is L=\u03a3li\n(see Supplemental Material [54], Video 1). (b) Two particles at initially\nclose distance r0=|x20\u2212x10| and identical initial angle \u03b10 diverge\nsignificantly from their path and self-trap on distinct locations at a\ndistance rf (see Supplemental Material, Video 2). (c) A self-avoiding particle\nchanges the effective geometry of the billiard (\u03a9, highlighted in blue) over\ntime. Mpi denotes the incident vector of the particle where I, II, and III are\nthe left, bottom, and right edges of the triangle, respectively, and the\ndigits refer to the segment numbers of the trajectory (e.g., 1 for l1). (d)\nThe dynamics of effective billiard area \u0303\u03a9 and the distance between the two\nparticles r. The inset shows the ensemble average of the effective area versus\ntime normalized by the trapping time tf. (e) Distribution of rf for polygons\nwith N\u2208[3,8]. In all cases, r0=10\u22123 and the distributions are calculated with\n105 samples.\n\nReuse & Permissions\n\n  * ###### Figure 2\n\nThe arrested state of triangular self-avoiding billiard.

(c)\nDistribution of self-trapped positions in regions I\u2013V, shown in (b), and the\nexamples of trajectories of various lengths.

(a) Probability density (\u03c1) of final\nself-trapping locations in a square, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, and\nnonagon as well as enneadecagon (N=19) and icosagon (N=20). Note that the\ncolor bars for each polygon are adjusted to better highlight the\ndistributions.
