And of the\n71 percent that did, 56 percent disclosed specific third-party companies that\ncould receive user information.\n\n\"It's shocking, and really kind of incomprehensible,\" said Dr Ari Friedman, an\nassistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Pennsylvania,\nwho \u2013 along with Matthew McCoy, Angela Wu, Sam Burdyl, Yungjee Kim, Noell\nKristen Smith, and Rachel Gonzales \u2013 authored the paper.\n\n\"People have cared about health privacy for a really, really, really long\ntime,\" Friedman noted in an interview with The Register. \"It's very\nfundamental to human nature. Even if it's information that you would have\nshared with people, there's still a loss, just an intrinsic loss, when you\ndon't even have control over who you share that information with.\"\n\n> There's an intrinsic loss when you don't even have control over who you\n> share that information with\n\nThe researchers' latest work builds on a study they published a year ago of\n3,747 US non-federal hospital websites. That found 98.6 percent tracked and\ntransferred visitors' data to large tech and social media companies,\nadvertising firms, and data brokers.\n\nTo find the trackers on websites, the team checked out each hospitals'\nhomepage on January 26 using webXray, an open source tool that detects third-\nparty HTTP requests and matches them to the organizations receiving the data.\nThey also recorded the number of third-party cookies per page.\n\n### Who is viewing your data?\n\nOne name in particular stood out, in terms of who was receiving website\nvisitors' information.\n\n\"In every study we've done, in any part of the health system, Google, whose\nparent company is Alphabet, is on nearly every page, including hospitals,\"\nFriedman observed.\n\n\"From there, it declines,\" he continued. \"Meta was on a little over half of\nhospital webpages, and the Meta Pixel is notable because it seems to be one of\nthe grabbier entities out there in terms of tracking.\"\n\nBoth Meta and Google's tracking technologies have been the subject of criminal\ncomplaints and lawsuits over the years \u2013 as have some healthcare companies\nthat shared data with these and other advertisers.\n\nIn addition, between 20 and 30 percent of the hospitals share data with Adobe,\nFriedman noted. \"Everybody knows Adobe for PDFs. My understanding is they also\nhave a tracking division within their ad division.\"\n\nOthers include telecom and digital marketing companies like The Trade Desk and\nVerizon, plus tech giants Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon, according to\nFriedman. Then there's also analytics firms including Hotjar and data brokers\nsuch as Acxiom.\n\n\"And two thirds of hospital websites had some kind of data transfer to a\nthird-party domain that we couldn't even identify,\" he added.\n\nOf the 71 hospital website privacy policies that the team found, 69 addressed\nthe types of user information that was collected. The most common were IP\naddresses (80 percent), web browser name and version (75 percent), pages\nvisited on the website (73 percent), and the website from which the user\narrived (73 percent).\n\nOnly 56 percent of these policies identified the third-party companies\nreceiving user information.\n\nWhile this puts hospital website visitors at risk of having their data\ncollected and shared with others that they may not want, it also poses a risk\nto the hospitals themselves, the researchers noted.\n\nHospitals aren't legally required to publish website privacy policies that\ndetail how they collect visitors' data and with whom they share it. But if\nthey do have a privacy policy, they better make sure their processes on\ndeleting personal information upon request, for example, follow the government\npolices \u2013 or they could face the wrath of regulators like the Federal Trade\nCommission.\n\n  * Nearly 1M medical records feared stolen from City of Hope cancer centers\n  * Ransomware can mean life or death at hospitals. DEF CON hackers to the rescue?\n  * US to probe Change Healthcare's data protection standards as lawsuits mount\n  * Ignore Uncle Sam's 'voluntary' cybersecurity goals for hospitals at your peril\n\n\"Websites that collect specific categories of information from certain users\nmay also be subject to other federal and state-specific requirements in terms\nof data collection and notice,\" the paper warns.\n\n\"While the suit against Mass General Brigham and the Dana Farber Cancer\nInstitute was brought under Massachusetts law, plaintiffs have brought similar\nclass action lawsuits in multiple states.\"\n\nMass General Brigham ended up paying an $18.4 million settlement to resolve a\nclass action lawsuit that alleged the institutions shared personally\nidentifiable information about patients to Facebook, Google, and other\ncompanies.\n\n### A fundamental rethink\n\nOf course, the data privacy threat extends beyond hospital websites, as\nFriedman is quick to point out.\n\n\"Why do hospitals have tracking on their webpages?\" he wondered. \"It's not\nthat they're taking kickbacks from Google and Acxiom, data brokers and\nadvertisers and social media companies that sell their patients' data in\nexchange for money.\n\n\"They're doing it because this stuff is ubiquitous across the whole web.\nThey're doing it because there's an entire tens of billions of dollars ad\neconomy.\"\n\nWhile it presents a major challenge for healthcare providers in general and\nhospitals specifically, it's also an opportunity.\n\n\"Many hospitals are academic hospitals and have computer science departments\nthat they could collaborate with, and design new tools and startups, which is\nsomething universities are good at doing,\" Friedman noted. \"Build a new web\nthat doesn't involve as much tracking.\n\nBut in the meantime, and in lieu of any federal data privacy law in the US,\nprotecting personal information falls to the individual. And for that,\nFriedman recommends browser-based tools Ghostery and Privacy Badger, which\nidentify and block transfers to third-party domains.\n\n\"It impacts your browsing experience almost none,\" he explained. \"It's free.\nAnd you will be shocked at how much tracking is actually happening, and how\nmuch data is actually flowing to third parties.\" \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Privacy\n  * Research\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Privacy\n  * Research\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * cookies\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n\n#### More about\n\n7 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Privacy\n  * Research\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Privacy\n  * Research\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * cookies\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### US legislators propose American Privacy Rights Act - and it looks quite\ngood\n\nAfter two decades of calls for national protections, something may actually\nhappen\n\nPublic Sector4 days | 39\n\n#### Academics probe Apple's privacy settings and get lost and confused\n\nJust disabling Siri requires visits to five submenus\n\nSecurity7 days | 30\n\n#### Tough luck, bosses, AI is coming for your job, too\n\nAlgorithms as PHBs \u2013 who wouldn't want that?\n\nAI + ML7 days | 38\n\n#### Reducing the cloud security overhead\n\nWhy creating a layered defensive strategy that includes security by design can\nhelp address cloud challenges\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Google will delete data collected from 'private' browsing\n\nDeclares victory in settlement of class action lawsuit, but individual claims\nremain possible\n\nPersonal Tech11 days | 30\n\n#### Boffins deem Google DeepMind's material discoveries rather shallow\n\nWeb titan rejects criticisms, insists AI-found compounds are legit\n\nAI + ML1 day | 20\n\n#### Reform of USA's Section 702 spying rule may make it to a vote this week\n\nTool that lets spooks observe Americans appears to have been renewed for\nanother year\n\nPublic Sector4 days | 12\n\n#### It's 2024 and Intel silicon is still haunted by data-spilling Spectre\n\nGo, go InSpectre Gadget\n\nResearch2 days | 22\n\n#### CHIPS Act hangover sees most US science agency budgets cut for 2024\n\n2025 unlikely to see more money flow as Congress turns off the tap\n\nPublic Sector3 days | 16\n\n#### Head of Israeli cyber spy unit exposed ... by his own privacy mistake\n\nInfosec in brief Plus: Another local government hobbled by ransomware; Huge\nrise in infostealing malware; and critical vulns\n\nSecurity4 days | 19\n\n#### Ex-White House CIO tells The Reg: TikTok ban may be diplomatic disaster\n\nInterview Theresa Payton on why US needs a national privacy law\n\nPublic Sector11 days | 63\n\n#### Lawsuit claims Meta hobbled Facebook Watch to help Netflix\n\nAdvertiser antitrust lawsuit says claimed deal with Netflix is anticompetitive\n\nPersonal Tech10 days | 2\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
