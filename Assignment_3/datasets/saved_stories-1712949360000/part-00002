But PMs aren\u2019t necessarily known for their use of it.\n\nSo when Tom Orbach reached out to me with his idea to write a deep dive on\nusing humor to grow your product, I was instantly in.\n\nI\u2019m really excited to share what he\u2019s put together today.\n\n##\n\nIntroducing Tom\n\nTom is Head of Growth Marketing at Wiz. He has a litany of expertise in using\nhumor to drive growth.\n\nHe\u2019s also author of the awesome Marketing Ideas newsletter. Be sure to\nsubscribe.\n\nI\u2019ve analyzed hundreds of viral products in recent years, and found that the\ncommon ground most shared was the use of humor.\n\nHumor can humanize your product, making it more relatable and memorable to\ncustomers through positive association.\n\nHowever, not all humor is created equal.\n\nTo win at the game of humor, startups must deploy humor in a very specific\nway.\n\n##\n\nToday\u2019s Post\n\nWords: 5,774 | Est.

The \u2018Golden Rules\u2019 to winning at the humor game\n\n  5. What if I\u2019m not very funny?\n\n##\n\n1\\. Why does humor work?\n\nPeople tend to think more highly of brands that use humor, but why?\n\n4 reasons:\n\n  1. Understanding\n\n  2. Word of Mouth\n\n  3. Motivation for Readers\n\n  4. Helps you Stand Out from the Crowd\n\n###\n\n1\\. Humor creates a sense of understanding.\n\nHumor bridges the gap between you and your customers, turning \u201cthem\u201d and \u201cme\u201d\ninto \u201cus\u201d.\n\n  * We belong to something.\n\n  * We\u2019re both in the know.\n\n  * We\u2019re on the same team.\n\nThis sense of \u201cthey understand me\u201d encourages trust and loyalty.\n\n###\n\n2\\. Humor increases \u2018Word of Mouth\u2019.\n\nHumans are social creatures.\n\nWhen we laugh, we want to pass our joy along to others, seeking connection,\nand sharing the humor.\n\nThis is why memes go viral.\n\nWhen people see something that they find funny, they often think:\n\n> \u201cMy friends HAVE to see this!\u201d\n\n###\n\n3\\. Humor can be motivating.\n\nWhen we laugh, our brains release endorphins that help us relax and make us\nfeel good. It creates positive experiences and makes you want more, becoming a\nmotivating factor in our decision-making.\n\nWe seek it out. We go where the funny is.\n\nIn a 2014 study, participants who were shown a humorous show (Mr. Bean, to be\nmore specific) and then asked to solve a secretly-impossible puzzle - spent\n50% more time trying than groups that watched non-funny videos \u2013 suggesting\nthat humor can motivate and energize people in everyday activities.\n\nBottom line: If you need your customers to get through a long and exhausting\nonboarding session, humor is the way to go.\n\n###\n\n4\\. It makes you stand out of the crowd.\n\nEspecially in B2B, formal communication is the standard. There\u2019s nothing wrong\nwith being professional and straightforward, but infusing your brand messaging\nwith curated humor can differentiate you from the competition.\n\nHumor comes at a risk \u2013 it requires companies to put themselves out there and\ndare, which is why most don\u2019t do it.\n\nSo\u2014if you are bold enough, you stand out.\n\n##\n\n2\\. Where should you leverage humor in your growth strategies?\n\nSo where does humor belong? The short answer is everywhere.\n\nThe challenge is that people often shy away from humor believing it\u2019s only\nreserved for certain channels like memes on social media or can only be\neffective with a certain demographic like Gen Z. Neither of these assumptions\nare true.\n\nIn my experience, there are 4 places where startups should use humor:\n\n###\n\nHumor Area 1 - Marketing\n\nHumor in marketing has a way of supercharging its ability to capture your\ntarget audience\u2019s attention and create a sense of connection between them and\nyour startup.\n\nUsing industry-specific humor in website copy, social media, events, and other\nmarketing assets can work wonders for almost any marketing metric (web\ntraffic, CTR, social engagement, etc).\n\nFrom my experience, there are 3 secrets for successfully using humor in\nmarketing: relatability, insight, and speaking the unspoken (more on that in a\nminute).\n\n###\n\nHumor Area 2 - Product\n\nAdding funny elements in unexpected places can spark interest in customers.\n\nAndroid discovered this opportunity in its early days by introducing fun\n\u201cEaster eggs\u201d that were hidden in their software updates.\n\nWhen users repeatedly tapped or long-pressed the version number, a scary-\nlooking gingerbread man appeared next to the Android logo with zombies holding\nsmartphones in the background.\n\nThis nod to common social commentary that phone use renders people brain-dead,\neffectively captivated the Android user base for two reasons.\n\n####\n\n1\\. People started talking about it\n\nAndroid users who learned about the Easter egg were quick to pass on the\nknowledge to others, wanting to share the spark of joy and forge a connection\nover a seemingly meaningless gesture from the development team.\n\nBecause the feature was exclusive to Androids, it contributed to the sense of\nbelonging and appreciation users felt for the brand. Remember when\n#TeamAndroid was a thing?\n\n####\n\n2\\. Users started anticipating (or at the very least, noticing) the next\nsoftware update\n\nUsers who would barely register the changes were now eagerly awaiting the next\ninstallation update so they could head straight to the version number to\nunveil the latest surprise.\n\nThis created the perfect opportunity for Android developers to infuse a little\nhumor and other more complicated perks like interactive backgrounds and\nminigames.\n\nThe lesson? A little unexpected humor in a strange place can go a long way\ntowards fostering brand loyalty.\n\nYou have loads of options to be creative with how humor is embedded in your\nproducts including 404 error pages, user instructions, terms and conditions,\nempty states, and settings toggles.\n\nThis can result in higher retention rates and increased word of mouth for\nfunny product delights that people can screenshot and share online. (We\u2019ll go\ninto more detail on these below.)\n\nSome startups even created funny features (designed simply to amuse and\nentertain by their mere existence):\n\n  * Tinder's \u201cSwipe Night\u201d: An interactive event within Tinder that presented a \"choose your own adventure\" story.\n\n  * Mailchimp's \u201cHigh Five\u201d: For a time, when users sent out a campaign, MailChimp would show an animated chimp's hand on the screen, offering a virtual \"high five.\"\n\n  * Waze's Celebrity Voices: The navigation app Waze has periodically offered users the option to have their directions narrated by various celebrities, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kevin Hart.\n\n###\n\nHumor Area 3 - Sales\n\nHumor can make your sales process stand out from your competitors.\n\nShowing off your sense of humor and making a memorable impression in initial\ncalls, presentations, and direct messages can improve response and closing\nrates.\n\nRemember \u2013 more than 70% of people surveyed say they\u2019d buy from a humorous\nbrand over a serious competitor.\n\nBeing lighthearted can also take the edge off otherwise stressful situations\n(for both you and the potential customer) like negotiations or cold calls.\n\nTactics include breaking the ice with a joke when sending cold DMs on LinkedIn\nor using memes in sales emails to add a personal touch and develop a positive\nrelationship with potential customers.\n\nNot all humor has to be delivered digitally.\n\nSending punny swag and closing gifts, like branded sunglasses with the\nmessage, \u201cour future together is so bright you\u2019ll need to wear shades\u201d brings\ncasual comedy to the table to help you leave with a loyal customer.\n\n###\n\nHumor Area 4 - Internally\n\nWhat do Best Buy, Etsy, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Southwest Airlines, and even LinkedIn\nhave in common?\n\nThey all list \u201cfun\u201d as a core brand value and are well-known for using\nplayfulness within their startup.\n\nEmbracing humor creates just as much brand loyalty in-house as it does with\ncustomers.\n\nIn my experience, humor is the best way to get buy-in from internal\nstakeholders and defend your big bets.\n\nWhen you\u2019re funny with colleagues, they will support your work (like signing\noff on your projects, advocating for you with management, and accepting your\ninfluence in meetings and group work).\n\nBuilding a positive startup culture that encourages humor can make employees\nhappier.\n\nA humorous workplace is often a healthy one. Studies have shown that light and\nupbeat work environments help increase employee satisfaction, promote higher\nproductivity, and boost creativity.\n\nIt\u2019s also a great tool for recruitment and retention.\n\n##\n\n3\\. The top 10 product areas to inject humor\n\nIn my 10+ years of experience, I have come across some excellent tactics for\nintegrating humor into tech products.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all method for Product Managers to add humor, but\nthese ideas should hopefully spark some ideas in your mind and inspire your\nfuture roadmap.\n\n###\n\nProduct Area 1 - 404 Pages\n\nThe first place I want to focus on is a page you hope people will rarely, if\never, see: 404 error pages. These error pages are normally quite frustrating\nas it means someone has used an invalid link.\n\nUsers might naturally bounce out of your product entirely upon seeing 404\npages.\n\nBy injecting a touch of comedy into your 404 page, you can reduce the\nlikelihood the visitor will leave in frustration.\n\nA creative 404 page can be a good way to help break the ice and make the user\nfeel less annoyed when the link is incorrect.\n\nHere\u2019s 3 examples.\n\n####\n\n1\\. Drift\n\nDrift makes use of a smart 404 error page that embeds a video of popular\nmusician DJ Khaled being lost at sea.\n\nThe implication is pretty clear: you might be \u2018lost\u2019 online, with an incorrect\nlink, but you are not lost at sea as he was.\n\nI appreciate witticisms like this, and this can be especially useful if you\nwant to try and lighten the tone somewhat.\n\n####\n\n2\\. Blizzard\n\nBlizzard Entertainment\u2019s 404 page says \u201cWe\u2019ve dispatched a rescue Murloc to\nguide you back to safety.\u201d\n\n####\n\n3\\. Hootsuite\n\nA final example can be found at Hootsuite, the popular social media platform.\n\nHootsuite uses a message that included a cute image of their mascot, Owly, on\na milk carton as a missing animal.\n\nThey then provide a comical statement saying \u2018Fowl Not Found\u2019 and that the\npage has \u2018flown the coop\u2019 before delivering a comical series of reasons why\nyou might have arrived at the 404 page.\n\n###\n\nProduct Area 2 - Empty States\n\nNext, empty states - the pages you show if the product has no content on it\n(before users integrate their APIs, populate with info, upload data, etc.).\n\nEmpty states are good for offering instructions, such as how to start a new\ndocument, for example, but they can also be a great chance to use some humor\nand comedy.\n\nThere are many great examples of empty states found here.\n\nOne great example I love is Southwest Airlines in airports - emphasizing the\nstruggle to find spare plugs to charge our devices prior to flying:\n\nAnother example I love is Gusto, an online payroll and human resources\nsolution service, that seemed to have a pleasant way of reducing my anxiety\nabout the empty state of my account dashboard page.\n\nAfter I finished all my to-do items, an empty state was displayed with the\nwords, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left to do. You deserve some ice cream.\u201d\n\nEmpty states do not have to be boring. Putting humor on them can make users\nfeel accomplished rather than stressed.\n\n###\n\nProduct Area 3 - Easter Eggs\n\nEaster eggs come in all shapes and sizes and can be pleasant surprises when\nfound within a product (like the Android example).\n\nGoogle, for example, is famous for its Easter eggs within its browser. During\nthe Olympic Games, Google often plays small Olympic-inspired games.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s latest web browser, Microsoft Edge, also contains a neat surfing\ngame\u2014simply search for edge://surf, and this cool little game appears\n\nFacebook Messenger also contains a small basketball game. Send a basketball\nemoji to someone, and then press on the basketball itself:\n\nThis brings up a small net \u2013 can you hit the shot? I have lost track of\nseveral conversations trying this one out.\n\nWe can even take this back to 404 pages \u2013 Nosh.com used to include a 404 error\npage that should be a fight between Nosh\u2019s staff and a \u2018hostile\u2019 web page that\nwas trying to run away.\n\nHumorous and something that breaks the ice and helps to bring a smile to the\nface of an otherwise frustrated user. You can see an example of Nosh\u2019s cool\nlittle Easter egg here.\n\n###\n\nProduct Area 4 - Documentation\n\nWhen someone is working their way through the instructions of anything, first\nand foremost they want answers.\n\nHowever, humor can be used to help lighten the mood a little. I have found\nthat humor in instructions and documentation can help to reduce frustration in\nthe user and help them to understand complex ideas.\n\nAvoid being too on the nose, though. I would recommend keeping the humor\nsubtle \u2013 perhaps a little in-joke. Make sure the humor is not insulting or\nsimply crowbarred in for the sake of trying to be funny.\n\nA great example that I can give is one of the comic book-style guidance that\nwas created for Google Chrome. Scott McCloud created a really interesting\n39-page comic built around Google developers.\n\nAnother infamous example is that of Clippy from the early days of Microsoft\nWord.\n\nSure, Clippy only gave out real advice about MS Word, but its messages are\ninsanely funny when read without context:\n\nI found some non-tech examples for this as well:\n\n  * TopGear: Some of the product webpages for TopGear t-shirts offer the following \u2018assurance\u2019 to users: \u201cThese T-shirts were tested on animals. They didn\u2019t fit.\u201d\n\n  * Puma: They offer the following \u2018helpful tip\u2019 to users: \u201cWASH THIS WHEN DIRTY.\u201d\n\n###\n\nProduct Area 5 - Onboarding Flow\n\nI love onboarding flows, but I love them more than when they inject a bit of\nhumor and charisma into the experience.\n\nBeyond just using funny GIFs, think about how you can weave humor throughout\nthe entire onboarding experience. Some ideas:\n\n  * Use a lighthearted, conversational tone in the copy. Imagine you're a friend walking them through the product for the first time.\n\n  * Add funny illustrations, comics or memes to break up instructional text and make things more engaging.\n\n  * Include humorous \"easter egg\" buttons or hotspots for users to discover that aren't essential but add delight when found.\n\n  * Gamify the process with challenges, points and humorous \"rewards\" or badges for completion.\n\nThe key is making onboarding feel less like a chore or homework assignment,\nand more like an exploration with fun surprises along the way. Humor helps\ndisarm new users and gets them excited to dive into your product.\n\nAn example of this is PostHog\u2019s email onboarding sequence:\n\nOn the employee side, one example that stands out immediately is a software\ndevelopment agency aimed at recruitment called Lever.\n\nLever would have every new employee sent a bespoke GIF created for them prior\nto their arrival on the team:\n\n###\n\nProduct Area 6 - User Inputs\n\nThe idea here is to react to user inputs with special \u2018decorations\u2019. \u2018\n\nJust like easter eggs, it will make users interact with your product more,\nlooking for those surprises (thus increasing engagement and retention).\n\nA great example of this is iMessage.\n\nIf you use iMessage, you might know that if you type \u201cCongratulations!\u201d then a\nshower of confetti will rain down the screen.\n\nThis looks really nice, and it makes the individuals in the message feel good\nabout what they have just seen.\n\nIt\u2019s comical, adds a topical tone to the message, and just brightens up the\nuser experience.\n\nSome other examples beyond iMessage confetti:\n\n  * Google Search: Try searching for \"do a barrel roll\" or \"askew\" and see what happens!\n\n  * Slack: Certain emojis trigger funny animations, like showering the screen with \ud83c\udf2e when you use the :taco: emoji\n\n  * Asana: Clicking the flying unicorn mascot in the bottom corner makes it do tricks and leave rainbow trails.\n\nThe opportunities for humor are endless - get creative with text inputs, swipe\ninteractions, button clicks, etc. Adding these playful surprises will make\nyour product more memorable and have users looking forward to every\ninteraction.\n\n###\n\nProduct Area 7 - Settings\n\nAdd a funny copy (and friction where necessary) to your settings screen.\n\nE.g. Gmail\u2019s calling me out for 'forgetting' those emails again:\n\nInjecting humor into settings and preferences is unexpected and can make\ndigging through menus actually enjoyable. More ideas:\n\n  * Tumblr's settings has jokes in the corner like \"Did you try unplugging it and plugging it back in?\"\n\n  * The Oatmeal's email unsubscribe confirmation references a fire: \"You have been unsubscribed and will no longer receive any emails from us. Unless of course, you re-subscribe. Or we decide to start sending you emails again. Or you are on fire.\"\n\nGet playful with toggles, radio button choices, empty state text, and more to\nmake settings a delight, not a drag. Users will appreciate the attention to\ndetail and your brand's unique personality shining through.\n\n###\n\nProduct Area 8 - Loading Screens\n\nWho says waiting has to be boring?\n\nAdd funny animations, witty messages (as if the algorithm is working hard),\ntrivia, fun facts, or anything that will entertain your audience for a few\nseconds while they wait.\n\nHeap does a great job of this, leaning on its own logo:\n\nDon't just settle for a basic spinner - use the time to serve up something\nfun! For example:\n\n  * Fallout game series: Shows retro \"public service announcements\" with humorous tips for surviving the apocalypse\n\n  * Slack: Features funny, tongue-in-cheek messages about work life: \"Doing a coffee run, be back never\"\n\n  * Discover app: Has a fun animation of the company's mascot, Peggy the Dog, chasing her tail.\n\nYou could also use the loading time to display funny facts, user stats, or\neven minigames if the wait is long enough. The key is turning a typically\nfrustrating experience (waiting) into a moment of delight.\n\n###\n\nProduct Area 9 - Feedback or Review Pages\n\nGetting customers to leave reviews of your product is difficult. Humor can\nhelp.\n\nI recently purchased an item on Amazon and left feedback for a seller.\nAfterward, it brought me to a \u201cReview Your Purchases\u201d page, which promised to\ntell me a joke if I left feedback on six more of my previous purchases. (See\nhighlight in the image below).\n\nIt\u2019s a fun, interactive and non harmful way to gather more feedback.\n\nIt\u2019s not just for reviews, for instance:\n\n  * Postmates: After submitting a suggestion, it shows: \"High five! Your feedback has been sent off to our UX team (which may or may not be a bunch of cats in hoodies).\"\n\n  * Windows 95 printer install fail message: \"An error occurred while writing device X. The specific error is unknown, but it's probably your fault. Have a nice day.\"\n\nYou can also incentivize feedback with a humorous prize or use funny imagery\nand gifs in the interface. Making users laugh as they share their thoughts\nshows you don't take yourself too seriously and sets a positive, casual tone\nthat encourages honest input.\n\n###\n\nProduct Area 10 - Completion Pages\n\nFinally, adding a nice bit of humor to completion messages can be a good idea\nto help add some positive energy to a task being completed. The best example\nthat I can think of for you to consider is the famous Mailchimp mascot.\n\nThis simple hand is now used as a common example of making users and showing\nempathy for their success.\n\nA smart and simple animation like this can be enough to make users smile and\nappreciate that they have completed their intended task.\n\nThat high five might just be a simple animation, but it is memorable and\nsomething Mailchimp users want to see when they finish setting up a campaign.\nAnd hey - it\u2019s funny. When was the last time you high-fived a chimp?\n\n##\n\n4\\. The \u2018Golden Rules\u2019 to winning at the humor game\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered the key areas where humor can be deployed, let\u2019s look\nat the three most effective methods to apply humor to your startup.\n\nCybersecurity is typically serious business. After all, there\u2019s nothing funny\nabout data breaches, ransomware, or cloud misconfigurations. At Wiz, we\ndecided to take a non-traditional approach that no one expected \u2013 the launch\nof CISOtopia, the first-ever toy store designed for cybersecurity\nprofessionals as an April Fool\u2019s Day joke.\n\nWe went all-in to the project. We even hired a 3D artist to create hilarious\nfake products for our online storefront, like blindfolds for your startup\u2019s\nlegal team (for when there\u2019s a cybersecurity incident).\n\nThe fake store quickly went viral as it was shared all over social media (e.g.\nReddit, X).\n\nWithin a week, the CISOtopia prank website had more than 110,000 unique\nvisitors.\n\nWe could also attribute a 15%-20% uplift in traffic to Wiz.io, our real\nwebsite, for the entire month of April (the CISOtopia launch month).\n\nAnd for the final twist \u2014 we actually manufactured most of these toys and\nended up handing them out at conferences.\n\nWhy did this work?\n\nBy bringing a lighter tone to an otherwise serious business, we were able to\nshake up the industry.\n\nDesigning fake toys for CISOs and cybersecurity pros turned out to be a great\nmove \u2013 the element of surprise was funny enough to garner attention long after\nApril Fool\u2019s had ended.\n\nThis leads us to our first \u201cGolden Rule\u201d of using humor to grow your\nstartup...\n\n###\n\nGolden Rule 1 \u2013 Be funny where everybody else isn\u2019t\n\nIf there\u2019s only one thing you remember from this guide at the end of the day,\nlet it be this: be funny where everybody else is not funny.\n\nThat\u2019s my number one rule of thumb. Catching your audience off-guard and\ncommanding their attention when and where they least expect it will create the\nmost shock-value and memorable experience with your startup.\n\nCompanies like Slack are the perfect example of this technique by sprinkling\nhumor into otherwise serious, unexpected spots like version updates in the App\nStore or automated messages, which are then circulated online by users who\nfind them funny.\n\nBy Infusing humor in unpredictable situations, you show people you\u2019re thinking\nabout them and understand them when they least expect it.\n\nAs a result, they will feel loved and \u201cseen\u201d and they will love you back.\n\nNow it\u2019s important to note that this approach can backfire if you go overboard\nor try to lighten sensitive subjects or deeply held beliefs (like politics or\nreligion).\n\nYou could inadvertently offend your customer base.\n\n###\n\nGolden Rule 2 \u2013 Be specific to your industry\n\nWhen it comes to humor, inside jokes are a secret weapon.\n\nSticking to industry-specific comic insights is the best way to engage\ncustomers and industry thought leaders.\n\nWhy?\n\nUsing inside jokes and speaking to your audience in \u201ctheir language\u201d makes\nthem feel loved, because no one usually spends the time or effort to create\nhumor made specifically for them and their interests.\n\nThat\u2019s the magic of humor in startup growth.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason nearly every industry and major organization from Google\nsoftware engineers to the US Coast Guard usually ends up with a company-run\nmeme page: humor that applies to a specific subset of people makes them feel\nunderstood.\n\nStart by creating a meme page or some memes of your own to share with your\ntarget audience on community pages.\n\n###\n\nGolden Rule 3 \u2013 Play off an unspoken insight everyone already knows\n\nA tested framework I like to use is to take an industry-insight everyone\nalready knows about and secretly agrees on and \u2014 make it public.\n\nI used this framework a few years ago which resulted in a funny-side project\ngoing viral and getting acquired: my Viral Post Generator for LinkedIn.\n\nIt was based on the insight that everyone thinks LinkedIn posts are cringey.\nWhile nearly everyone agrees, hardly anyone talks about it.\n\nIt all started when I scraped thousands of viral LinkedIn posts in an attempt\nto find a common thread.\n\nIn doing so, I learned the most frequently used word in posts was \u201cme\u201d \u2013\npeople LOVE talking about themselves on the platform, sometimes inflating the\nmost simple experiences to make up an inspirational message in hopes of\nturning heads.\n\nI combined that with the general insight that most users find inflated\nLinkedIn posts cringy (something everyone knows but is rarely talked about \u2013\nthere\u2019s that key rule again!) and turned it into a simple Viral Post Generator\nthat generated cringeworthy posts based on users input.\n\nI added a cringe meter for good measure (ha!), made the resulting post\nshareable, and struck gold. It quickly caught fire and went viral.\n\nThe cringe meter (that, by the way, didn\u2019t actually function) turned out to be\nthe secret sauce, so to speak \u2013 users were constantly talking about it online\n\u2013 reflecting the unspoken insight.\n\nThe generator was used by more than 2 million people and was acquired 2 weeks\nafter launching.\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n> What\u2019s the one thing in your industry that everyone has emotions towards\n> (love, excitement, fear, hate, anger, etc) \u2014 but no one really speaks about\n> out loud?\n\n##\n\n5\\. What if I\u2019m not very funny?\n\nNot everyone is born with the gift of humor like a Saturday Night Live star,\nbut here\u2019s the good news \u2013 humor is a skill that can be developed like any\nother capability, just like teamwork, communication, and prioritization.\n\nIt\u2019s unique and personal to you as a product manager and, on a larger scale,\nyour startup.\n\nFrom my experience, there are a few quick and practical methods for applying\nhumor. I\u2019ve gathered some tips over the years to get you started into a Humor\n101 \u2018Cheat Sheet\u2019 below.\n\nUse these tips when you want to add a little lightness but aren\u2019t sure where\nto start.\n\n###\n\nSolution 1 - Keep it simple\n\nYou don\u2019t have to write a ten-minute comedy set to make an impression.\n\nStay professional and accurate, but use down-to-earth, everyday language to\nmake content more relatable to your audience.\n\nKeep techie jargon to a minimum when addressing users, unless you can work it\ninto a punchline to appeal to industry professionals!\n\n###\n\nSolution 2 - Find common ground\n\nWhat do you and your audience already share insight on?\n\nLike my Viral Post Generator, I was able to quickly connect with my audience\nonce I found a common denominator \u2013 the cringeworthiness of LinkedIn.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point...\n\n###\n\nSolution 3 - Be data-driven\n\nI never would have found the common thread that led to creating a viral\napplication if it wasn\u2019t for data.\n\nPlugging in thousands of LinkedIn posts to a table pointed me to the very\nthing I needed to relate to millions of people.\n\nAnalyze your audience to find out what they care about, the kind of language\nthey use (how they \u201ctalk\u201d online), and find common threads that aren\u2019t really\nspoken out loud.\n\nTake that data and use it to develop humorous content curated specifically for\nthem.\n\n###\n\nSolution 4 - Be relatable, but not controversial\n\n\"The Humor Code\" by Peter McGraw and Joel Warner discusses Benign Violation\nTheory, the concept that humor arises when something seems wrong or unsettling\nbut is simultaneously safe.\n\nThe key is to find the boundary and get close without crossing it, playfully\nacknowledging uncomfortable facts, beliefs, or circumstances without being\noffensive or insensitive.\n\nThe balance of dark with light humor is what determines the success of the\njoke \u2013 too much of either and the joke can fail to land or worse, backfire.\n\nTake IT professionals, for example.\n\nThey work hard, they\u2019re kind of lonely, and it can be easy to overlook their\nmany contributions. An ad on a subway station asked viewers, \u201chave you hugged\nyour IT person lately?\u201d.\n\nThis lightheartedly poked fun at the plight of the IT department without\nmaking it offensive while, at the same time, making IT workers feel seen and\nunderstood.\n\n###\n\nSolution 5 - Don\u2019t fake it \u2018til you make it \u2013 keep it real and keep trying\ninstead\n\nAuthenticity is key to making the connection, according to acclaimed comedian\nSteve Martin\u2019s memoir, Born Standing Up.\n\nBasing comedic and humorous content on your real, lived experiences,\nviewpoints, and brand values is the key to win loyal followers.\n\nIf the phishing awareness meme you included in a company-wide email didn\u2019t get\nas many positive acknowledgements as you\u2019d hoped, don\u2019t hang up your hat.\n\nThere are plenty more opportunities to share tech-related humor. You should\ntake every one.\n\nIt may take a few tries to achieve the expected result, but take Steve\u2019s word\nfor it:\n\n> Persistence is important in finding your comedic voice.\n>\n> \u2014Steve Martin\n\n###\n\nSolution 6 - Tell a made-up story\n\nIt\u2019s possible to breathe new life into something people are already familiar\nwith \u2013 like the time we ran an atypical story on the Wiz blog. It wasn\u2019t the\nusual tech-focused write-up.\n\nInstead, I wrote a long, mostly made-up story on the history of the socks we\ngive away in our swag bags. That\u2019s right: socks. Ones we don\u2019t even sell.\n\nI retold human history, featuring our branded socks woven into every major\nevent and on every historical icon from The Big Bang to the Mona Lisa. People\nloved it.\n\nThey were familiar with the true history behind the events I outlined, but\nadding the funny, surprising, and nonsensical element of the socks made them\nlaugh.\n\nWhy did this generate buzz?\n\nAccording to one study, it\u2019s possible that we remember funny stories more\noften than we remember other positive emotions. Participants were given knock-\nknock jokes with or without a pun.\n\nThe group that was exposed to the jokes with the original puns consistently\nshowed better memory recall. This suggests that it\u2019s especially easy to make a\nlasting impression with a pun, because it\u2019s a more simple delivery that\nrequires less mental effort.\n\nBrief, clever puns stick around in our minds \u2013 whether it\u2019s because of the \u201cah\nha, you got me!\u201d moments that happen when we don\u2019t correctly guess the ending\nor because it makes us laugh so hard we go weak in the knees.\n\nEither way, we remember the interaction fondly.\n\n###\n\nSolution 7 - Play off others\n\nBeing adaptable, especially in interactions with our peers or audience, can\nproduce brilliant, spontaneous moments of humor with major impact.\n\nIn improv, this is called the \u201cYes, And\u201d concept, outlined in this book by the\nsame name, where you agree and add to a person\u2019s suggestions to create the\nscene.\n\nUsing improvisation is shown to increase confidence and reduce social anxiety,\nmaking it easier to connect.\n\nUse improv to collaborate with teammates internally, using each others\u2019 ideas\nand suggestions to build something humorous together instead of closing the\nconversation.\n\nIf I\u2019d been booed or shut down when I pitched the aforementioned History of\nSocks blog, we never would have made our customers (and other cybersecurity\npros) laugh and would have lost that opportunity for connection.\n\n###\n\nSolution 8 - Crowdsource your material\n\nIn 2023, we announced our annual Meme Battle at Wiz. We asked employees to\ncreate cybersecurity memes and tasked the public with voting for the best one.\n\nWe didn\u2019t anticipate what would happen next: A huge cybersecurity LinkedIn\npage (The Cyber Security Hub) with more than a million followers shared one of\nthe memes and tagged us. We plugged an ad in the first comment and saw a major\ninflux in followers on the same day.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have to try to be funny ourselves. We asked other people to tell us\nwhat they found funny, and inviting them to collaborate with us in finding\nhumor paid off more than we expected.\n\n###\n\nSolution 9 - Use tried-and-true comedy formulas to break down barriers\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to come up with something on your own, learn from the\nprofessionals by borrowing a framework and tailor it to fit your needs.\n\nHere are some of the most common, established comedic premises to build your\njokes and stories and deliver your concept to the audience:\n\n  * Situational Irony is when something unexpected happens instead of the expected outcome and you point it out in a funny way. Use it to boost team morale or in (appropriate) customer service DMs.\n\n  * Observational humor points out something interesting about an event, idea, or condition that your audience is familiar with. Create humor in product updates and new launches to engage users, or use it internally in meetings and group work to elevate the mood and keep things lighthearted.\n\n  * Rule of Three lists three items, using the first two to set a pattern and the third to break it, creating a surprise that triggers laughter. Use the Rule of Three in unexpected places, like terms and conditions, follow up emails, and Slack messages to your coworkers to increase responsiveness!\n\nDon\u2019t combine them or overcomplicate things. Just pick one formula and master\nit. Remember, the goal is to make the audience feel seen.\n\n##\n\nNow it\u2019s time to crack some jokes\n\nYou don\u2019t need to rely on knock-knock jokes to win people over and grow your\nbusiness \u2013 wit, brevity, honesty, and a little practice are all you need to\ncreate rapport.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know where to start, follow my simple cheat sheet above. Most\nimportantly, remember the 3 Golden Rules.\n\nAs long as you:\n\n  1. Commit to being funny where everyone else isn\u2019t\n\n  2. Use industry-specific humor to connect with your audience\n\n  3. And leverage an existing insight that everyone already agrees upon\n\nYou\u2019ll be positioned for positive growth outcomes.\n\nThese key rules will lead you to comedic success and ultimately build a brand\nexperience that your customers will connect with at a more personal level.\n\nHit me up in the comments if you have any questions!\n\n\u2014\n\nTom Orbach\n\n##\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n  * The April Fools virality playbook for fearless marketers\n\n  * Fake offline stunts that make your product famous\n\n  * How to transform 'boring' content into viral hits\n\n  * The Product Copy Playbook\n\nSubscribe to Product Growth to vote on this poll\n\nOnly subscribers can vote on this poll.\n\nAlready a subscriber?
