Best Ways to List Data in Your App\n\nUX/Design Practices\n\nby: Phil Kirkham\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Linkedin\n  * Hackernews\n\n### Article summary\n\n  * Alphabetical\n  * Chronological\n  * So Much Data\n  * Not Much Data\n  * Most Used\n  * Desktop/Mobile\n  * User Knows Best\n  * Search\n\nIf you\u2019re in custom software development, your app will probably show a list\nof data somewhere at some point. This could be anything from users to orders\nto items in your character\u2019s backpack. You\u2019ve worked out how and where to\nstore the data and how to edit and delete it. All that\u2019s left is to display\nit.\n\nJob done, onto the next story in your backlog... or is it? What order are you\ngoing to display the data in?\n\n## Alphabetical\n\nThis seems reasonable. But, what if the data is people\u2019s names? Do you sort\nthem by first name or surname? Display surname first? Is the ordering case\ninsensitive?\n\nWhen testing this, make sure to see if leading spaces can mess up the nice\nordering.\n\n## Chronological\n\nOkay, so let\u2019s sort them by the date of entry. But, does that mean we show the\nmost recent first or the oldest first?\n\nIf the data is edited, should this make a difference to the ordering, and\nshould it be based on the last edit?\n\nWhen testing this, see if timezones can mess up the nice ordering.\n\n## So Much Data\n\nWill there be lots of data? If so, should there be some sort of pagination or\ninfinite scrolling?\n\n## Not Much Data\n\nWhat if there\u2019s a case where there might only be one piece of data in a\nspecific scenario? Could or should we make this a special case and have it\nautomatically selected? That way, the user does not have to actually select it\nsince it\u2019s the only selection available.\n\n## Most Used\n\nAn alternative approach could be to put the most used items at the top if that\nuse case makes sense.\n\n## Desktop/Mobile\n\nDoes your design only cater to desktop users? And, will the data be squashed\nup and illegible when viewed on a tablet or phone?\n\n## User Knows Best\n\nThe user knows what they want to do with the list of data so let them sort it\nhowever they want \u2014 but does every column of data need a filter/sort option?\n\n## Search\n\nCongrats! You\u2019ve decided how to display the list of data. So, now move on to\nwhat to do if the user wants to search through it...\n\nI hope this post shows that even a \u2018simple CRUD app\u2019 is not really that\nsimple, what data display problems have you come across? Let me know in the\ncomments.\n\nappdata\n\nPhil Kirkham Quality Analyst at Atomic Object, helping teams by finding issues\nbefore the customer does.
