In the\nyears since, Acqualia Software launched an iPadOS version of the app and,\ntoday, an iOS version.\n\nAs I said in my review of the Mac app:\n\n> The strength of Soulver lies in its flexibility. Full-fledged spreadsheet\n> apps like Numbers and Excel have their place. However, day-to-day life\n> requires calculations that don\u2019t demand that level of horsepower and benefit\n> from contextualizing numbers with text. It\u2019s the kind of math that happens\n> in notebooks and on the back of envelopes. By combining elements of a text\n> editor, spreadsheet, and plain English syntax, Soulver commits those easily-\n> lost notebook scribblings to a format that allows for greater\n> experimentation and easier sharing.\n\nThat\u2019s as true of the iPhone version of Soulver as it was of the app\u2019s other\nversions, perhaps more so. That\u2019s because many people are more likely to have\ntheir iPhone with them than a Mac. With Soulver on iOS for the first time in a\nlong time, it\u2019s easier than ever to explore numerical \u2018what-ifs.\u2019 For example,\nwhat would my payment be if I refinanced my mortgage? How close am I to\nspending my budget for that party I\u2019m planning? The possibilities go on and\non.\n\nSoulver works in portrait and landscape on iOS.\n\nThe secret to the success of the iOS version of Soulver compared to the Mac or\niPad is its compact design. Despite the lack of horizontal space, the app\nmaintains its familiar split-style view with the narrative that accompanies\nyour calculations on the left, the results on the right, and a tally along the\nbottom of the screen. Because lines wrap, there\u2019s no need to worry about\nverbose calculations either. Plus, Soulver works in landscape mode, opening up\nmore room to describe your math.\n\nInstead of organizing Soulver sheets in an always-visible left sidebar, as you\nwould on the Mac and iPad, Soulver 3 for iOS tucks the sidebar away on the\nleft, where it\u2019s just a swipe away. The edge of your current sheet remains\nvisible when you\u2019re in the sidebar view, helping provide context for where you\nare in the app. From here, you can swipe to delete sheets or long-press to\ncopy a deep link, duplicate, share, move, or delete it. The sidebar is where\nyou can organize your documents into folders and access various settings and\nSoulver\u2019s excellent help documentation.\n\nSoulver 3\u2019s dedicated calculator keypad.\n\nAll versions of Soulver 3 handle a long list of calculations, including:\n\n  * Arithmetic\n  * Percentages\n  * Unit conversions\n  * Date math\n  * Time zones\n  * Video timecodes and frame math\n  * Financial and stock price calculations\n\nComments, labeling, and variables are also available, along with a custom\nnumber keypad for quickly adding calculations.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me and love to customize your apps, you\u2019re in luck there too.\nThere are long lists of settings to format numbers and other editing\nparameters to your liking, along with font and other styling controls. Soulver\nalso has settings for how sheets look and behave, including options to save\nthem locally or to sync them across devices using iCloud.\n\nSoulver can track stock prices and more.\n\nFinally, for an additional subscription, you get advanced weather data, live\nand historical stock prices, and an inline AI assistant based on OpenAI\u2019s\nGPT-4 Turbo, all of which can be used as data sources for your sheets.\n\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Soulver for a long time. The app is an excellent way to\nwork out problems involving numbers and math in a way that\u2019s reminiscent of\npaper but with the benefits of a digital environment. My needs in this area\nare fairly simple, so I don\u2019t need the weather, stock, and AI add-on\nsubscription, but I\u2019m glad to see that the app is finally available on iOS,\niPadOS, and Mac. Next, I\u2019d love to see a visionOS version.\n\nSoulver 3 is available on the App Store as a Universal app. However, the app\nrequires the following separate In-App Purchases for each version after a\n30-day free trial:\n\nPlatform| Price  \n---|---  \niOS| $14  \niPadOS| $20  \nmacOS| $34.99  \n  \nThe subscription that adds advanced weather, stock, and AI data is $26/year.\nThat\u2019s expensive compared to similar apps, and it\u2019s unusual to find apps with\nthis sort of pricing structure these days, but for anyone who has come to rely\non Soulver over the years, it\u2019s a worthwhile investment.\n\nTags: apps, iOS, utility\n\nJoin\n\n### Unlock More with Club MacStories\n\nFounded in 2015, Club MacStories has delivered exclusive content every week\nfor over six years.\n\nIn that time, members have enjoyed nearly 400 weekly and monthly newsletters\npacked with more of your favorite MacStories writing as well as Club-only\npodcasts, eBooks, discounts on apps, icons, and services.
