My mom\npreferentially shopped at Kroger. I can still hum the \u201cLet\u2019s Go Krogering\u201d\njingle and remember Marty Brennaman and Joe Nuxhall on their commercials. I\nknow many people at Kroger who I like and respect.\n\nBut anymore, shopping at Kroger makes me feel like a criminal. I shop at\nKroger every Monday to pick up my food staples. Since 2021, the loss\nprevention \u2018features\u2019 at my Kroger have continued to get more onerous to the\npoint of absurdity.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n## Kroger\u2019s anti theft, anti shopper tools\n\nAbout two years ago, my store was remodeled. And in this particular\nremodeling, they moved all of the personal care, laundry supplies, and other\nitems that are shoplifted into a separate walled off section. So now, in order\nto buy groceries and toothpaste, because I\u2019m a potential thief, I have to go\nthrough two checkout lines. Everyone loves waiting in line for checkout, so\nwhy not do it twice!\n\nMy store also makes announcements randomly like \u201cSecurity check all cameras\u201d\nor \u201cSecurity aisle 6 for location 3.\u201d The first time I heard it, I chuckled to\nmyself and said, \u201cSucks to be the guy in aisle 6,\u201d and then checked to make\nsure I wasn\u2019t the guy in aisle 6. These announcements are just made randomly\nand not meant to deter a specific shoplifter. They\u2019re no more helpful than the\n\u201ctop of the hour conditioning\u201d which I never see any employees perform. These\nannouncements make me \u2013 and everyone in the store \u2013 ask themselves if they are\nthe criminal in aisle 6.\n\nMy store is used as a test for new security \u2018features\u2019. One test was to use an\nAI video detection from a company called Everseen at self check out to catch\ntheft. I encountered numerous false positives. When I checked out, the system\nwould flag me for having two items in my hands at once or flag me for waving\nmy hand near my bags. Each time, the clerk would come over, review the video,\nclear the error, and let me continue. I averaged one false positive per\ncheckout. Multiply this error across six kiosks and the checkout line became\nungainly long. This test was ended after 2 months, but having a defective AI\naccuse me of shoplifting and increasing checkout times is infuriating.\n\nKroger also has placed cameras with video screens throughout the store. There\nis one at the alcohol, one at the store within a store, and each self checkout\nhas one. So not only do I get recorded, but I get reminded that I\u2019m a\nprospective criminal because I dared to buy a bottle of wine, buy dental\nfloss, or use the self checkout.\n\nKroger has always had security guards at my store. I\u2019ve noticed that the\nguards progressively look less like a friendly door greeter and much more like\na police officer. This week while leaving, my shopping cart suddenly locked up\nin the atrium and I couldn\u2019t push it. The security guards came over, moved my\ncart out of the door, and asked me for my receipt. The guard \u2013 very polite \u2013\nreviewed my receipt perfunctorily and then let me go. So now, Kroger thinks\nthat I\u2019m a thief and locked my shopping cart in a crowded door, because I left\nthe store.\n\n## Looking at the Financials: Are they effective?\n\nAll 10 regular readers of my blog know that I like to at financial statements\nto answer why do companies do what they do. Retail theft \u2013 often lumped in\nwith \u201cshrink\u201d \u2013 is usually accounted for as part of cost of goods sold.\nPulling the most recent income statement from the 10K into Excel and analyzing\nmerchandise costs and operating profit as a percentage of sales is indicative\nof the situation:\n\nKroger has very narrow operating profit \u2013 only about 2% \u2013 3% of sales \u2013 which\nis pretty normal for retail and groceries in particular. Merchandise costs are\nvery stable at 78-79%. These financials are pretty much to trend across the\npast 6 years.\n\nWhen analyzing inventory costs, it\u2019s crucial to examine the inventory cost\nmethod. Kroger\u2019s uses LIFO \u2013 last in first out \u2013 which means that if a store\nbuys units of inventory costing $5.00, $5.10, and $5.20 in that order, then\nthe cost of the first unit sold will be $5.20 and the second $5.10. In an\ninflationary environment where the purchases exceed sales, LIFO will depress\nmargin. So, Kroger is retaining its margins despite facing an inflationary\nenvironment.\n\nKroger also provides a non-GAAP measure using FIFO and some analysis of the\nFIFO based margins which is probably the most helpful:\n\n> \u201cOur FIFO gross margin rate, which excludes the LIFO charge, was 22.31% in\n> 2023, compared to 21.86% in 2022... Our FIFO gross margin rate increased 18\n> basis points in 2023, compared to 2022. This increase in rate was achieved\n> while also investing in price to maintain a competitive price position and\n> deliver greater value for our customers. This increase resulted primarily\n> from strong Our Brands performance, our ability to effectively manage\n> product cost through strong sourcing practices, lower transportation costs,\n> as a percentage of sales, and the effect of our terminated agreement with\n> Express Scripts, partially offset by increased promotional price investment\n> and higher shrink, as a percentage of sales.\u201d\n>\n> KR 2024 10K (emphasis my own)\n\nSo Kroger is probably seeing margins stay pretty consistent year to year\ndepending on how inflation effects are considered. Key is that they are seeing\na higher shrink but does not provide numbers. I went back through previous\n10Ks and noted the same language for increasing shrink for fiscal years ending\nin Jan 2023 and 2022, but was decreasing in Jan 2021, 2020, and 2019. Kroger\u2019s\npush on theft seemed to start in 2021 \u2013 so thus far, all data that we have to\ndate doesn\u2019t show that it\u2019s been particularly effective.\n\n## Aggressively Nudging\n\nOne of the core tenants of social psychology is that the environment\ninfluences the behavior of individuals. Chicago professor Richard Thaler\nencourages companies to \u201cNudge for Good\u201d by optimizing choice architecture and\nenvironmental factors to \u2018nudge\u2019 people to better decisions. In that way,\npeople retain their free will and decision making \u2013 but are more likely to\nmake a better choice since there is less cognitive load in making a better\nchoice.\n\nMost retail stores have long maintained cameras, security staff, anti-theft\ntags and other loss prevention techniques. Most of these techniques were in\nthe background though \u2013 and most shoppers were unaware of them. Kroger is\nchanging the approach at my store. It\u2019s not a passive watching and stopping\nindividual, confirmed thieves \u2013 rather, Kroger is actively trying to nudge\npeople to not commit theft.\n\nNudging shoppers to not commit theft seems to be for good \u2013 after all, people\nshouldn\u2019t commit theft, it causes higher prices, and so on. The problem with\nKroger\u2019s nudges is that they aren\u2019t so much a nudge, as a smack of the hand.\nMy larger concern is also that these smacks might not just modify behavior in\nthat moment to stop theft, but also change how shoppers see themselves. For\ninstance, if my Kroger store identifies me as a potential thief to reduce\nshoplifting, do I start to identify as a thief? What does that mean for me, my\nidentity, how I behave at Kroger, and how do I behave in the larger community?\n\n## What\u2019s the fallout for Kroger?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make a conclusion with the data that is present in the 10K\nwhether Kroger is effectively fighting theft. I also don\u2019t know the larger\nimpact of Kroger smacking me to tell me to not steal repeatedly. I do know\nthat I don\u2019t like being characterized as a thief every time I walk through the\nstore. Kroger not only monitors shoppers, but also makes them conscious of\nthat monitoring or even further, accuse legitimate shoppers of theft\nimplicitly.\n\nThis pervasive monitoring and accusation leads to some tough questions:\n\n  1. Will these anti-theft features at stores make shoppers less likely to shop at Kroger?\n  2. Does Kroger use the same anti theft approach at all of its stores? And how does that correlate with store shrink rates, race, poverty, and so on?\n  3. How does the very obvious anti-theft devices change Kroger shoppers perceptions of themselves? Ie \u2013 if Kroger makes it clear that it views me as a potential criminal, will that change my behavior at their stores?\n  4. How should customers and communities respond given the continued challenges of food desserts and lack of access to healthy foods in communities?\n\nI don\u2019t have answers for these questions \u2013 hopefully, someone at Kroger has\nconsidered them \u2013 but when I hear \u201cLet\u2019s go Krogering,\u201d my response is, \u201cNo,\nI\u2019d rather not.\u201d\n\nCategory finance, managementTagged accounting, KR, Kroger, loss prevention,\nretail, social psychology\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
