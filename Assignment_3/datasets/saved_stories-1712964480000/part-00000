Seeing so\nmany good people being let go has been heartbreaking.\n\nGetting laid off doesn\u2019t just rattle your career; it shakes the very\nfoundation of your life. I've seen friends lose their jobs and go into an\nexistential tailspin. It's not uncommon for them to blame themselves and to\nfeel immense guilt and shame. The experience is especially hard on parents\nwhose families depend on them for income.\n\n## An inevitable outcome of a flawed system\n\nLayoffs are inevitable during a company's lifespan. But seeing startups cut\n20-30% of their workforce feels especially cruel in light of the aggressive\nhiring they did during the pandemic.\n\nThe recent tech layoff spree resulted from companies following the wrong\nincentives. Investors had flooded the market with cash and told companies to\nhire aggressively, and growth took precedence over profitability. Then,\ncapital dried up, and companies started thrashing. Their response was to fire\nlarge groups of people in a hasty and unthought-out manner.\n\nThis is a sad reality of corporations optimizing for investor returns: the\npeople who work on and buy the product suffer. Good employees are fired, and\nuseful products are shut down.\n\nThis chaos has reaffirmed my belief that we need more calm companies.\n\nOn the Pathless Path podcast, Paul Millard asked me to define \"calm company:\"\n\n## Calm Company definition\n\nA calm company's purpose is to provide exceptional service to customers while\nsimultaneously improving the lives of the people who work there.\n\nBy default, a calm company is profitable. Those profits give a calm company\nits resilience: there's no last-minute scramble to meet payroll or earn a\nlast-minute sale to keep the business afloat. The company has enough financial\nmargin to weather economic storms.\n\nHere is my list of Calm Company attributes:\n\n  1. Profitability: A strong financial engine gives you more freedom. Profits help you invest more significantly in your product and your team (and their families). Most businesses that struggle don't have a financial engine that's working well.\n\n  2. Purpose: A solid financial foundation complements the company's core purpose\u2014to improve lives, provide exceptional service, and create a nurturing environment for employees. Success encompasses impact and profitability, measured by the positive effects on the team and the broader community.\n\n  3. Sustainable Growth: Growth should be mindful and sustainable. Avoid rapid expansion that sacrifices the company's culture, quality, or values. Growing the company should serve a purpose. Ambition is good, but not at the expense of well-being.\n\n  4. Freedom and Flexibility: As founders, we build businesses to give us more freedom. A Calm Company gives team members the flexibility to live well, pursue hobbies, exercise, take breaks, go on trips, and connect with family and friends.\n\n  5. Mindful Decision-Making: Decisions and commitments are made mindfully. Ask: will this decision make our lives worse? More stressful? Does it align with our values?\n\n  6. Calm Work Environment: Stress and chaos are replaced with clear work goals, boundaries, and communication.\n\n## Contrast: the Frenzied Company\n\nLet's contrast the idea of a Calm Company with that of a Frenzied Company.\n\nA frenzied company is perpetually in crisis. They have a culture of impossible\ndeadlines and unrealistic expectations.\n\nManagers pressure employees to constantly be \"on\" and \"available,\" even after\nwork hours.\n\n> Looks like we won\u2019t be hiring anyone in California ever again \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n> pic.twitter.com/EKf31ldE67\n>\n> \u2014 @jason (@Jason) April 4, 2024\n\nAn implicit\u2014or sometimes explicitly stated\u2014threat hangs over everyone\u2019s head:\n\"If things don\u2019t turn around, jobs will be lost.\"\n\nManagers frequently dump their stress and anxiety on their staff, and\nemployees frequently find themselves absorbing negative emotions from work.\nThey come home feeling drained and overwhelmed.\n\nFinancially, frenzied companies aren't profitable (or have bad margins) and\nneed to rely on a continuous influx of investment or debt to keep the lights\non. Often, the business's fundamentals are bad and unlikely to improve.\n\nFounders at frenzied companies believe that pushing harder and working longer\nwill lead to success. But often, the business's underlying structure is\nrotten. They can't overcome the weight of a bad business model, poor margins,\nand out-of-control spending.\n\nThe frenzied company is a cautionary tale. The path to success isn't to \"grind\nharder\" but to build products that people want that you can sell with healthy\nprofit margins.\n\n## My story of calm\n\nWhen Jon and I started Transistor, we were in our late thirties. We'd worked\nfor venture-funded companies, experienced layoffs, and felt the squeeze. We\nasked each other: \"Why are we building this business? What's this in service\nof?\" Our conclusion was to design the company to improve our lives.\n\nTo do that, we needed a strong financial engine. That's not easy (and it takes\na bit of luck). But once we had one, we had the power to shape our lives\nthrough our decisions: How much financial margin would we keep in the\nbusiness? How much margin for our time? What about leaving margin for our\nphysical and emotional health?\n\nBuilding a calm company has meant saying no to opportunities that don't align\nwith our values. We've purposefully declined complicated enterprise contracts\nthat would require us to staff up, add more compliance, and sign complicated\nlegal contracts. We try not to commit to projects that burn us out. We've\nprioritized doing work that we enjoy and that brings customers value.\n\nThe world needs more indie entrepreneurs building calm businesses. We won't\nget more calm from publicly traded companies or the over-funded venture-backed\nclass. It's going to come from the next crop of small, purposefully built,\nindie startups with healthy margins.\n\nCheers, Justin Jackson\n\nConnect with me on: \ud83d\udcbc LinkedIn \ud83d\udc18 Mastodon \ud83e\uddf5 Threads \ud83d\udc26 Twitter\n\n### Get my newsletter\n\nThanks!
