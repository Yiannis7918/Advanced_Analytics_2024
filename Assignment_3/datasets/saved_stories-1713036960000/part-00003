(Justin Maxon for The\nAtlantic)\n\nIdeas\n\n# The Truth About Organic Milk\n\nCows are suffering on even the most \u201chumane\u201d dairy farms.\n\nBy Annie Lowrey\n\nPhotographs by Justin Maxon for The Atlantic\n\nApril 12, 2024, 7:31 AM ET\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up\nfor it here.\n\nThis winter, I attended a livestock auction on California\u2019s remote northern\ncoast. Ranchers sat on plywood bleachers warming their hands as the auctioneer\nmumble-chanted and handlers flushed cows into a viewing paddock one by one.\nMost of the cows were hale animals, careering in and cantering out. But one\nlittle brown cow moved tentatively, rheum slicking her left eye and a denim\npatch covering her right.\n\nThat night, I went to take a closer look at her along with a pair of animal-\nwelfare investigators and some of the traders who had participated in the\nauction. Cow 13039, as her ear tag identified her, was segregated with other\nsick or injured cattle in a pen near the viewing paddock. A farmhand led her\ninto a squeeze chute, so that I could see her udders and feel her bony sides\nand scratch her head.\n\nThe denim patch had been glued straight onto her right orbital rim. I helped\nwork up the patch\u2019s edge; when a rancher finally ripped it off, her eyeball\nswelled from its socket, tethered to her skull by muscle and sinew and skin.\nUnable to focus, the eye rotated wildly. It had ruptured, its wet inner\ncontents extruding from the broken membrane; blood and green pus suppurated\nfrom its edges, smelling of copper and must. The cow had \u201ccancer eye,\u201d the\nrancher who had purchased her guessed, the most common bovine cancer.\n\nCow 13039, the auction affidavit showed, came from one of the country\u2019s\npreeminent dairy farms: Alexandre Family Farm, a nationwide supplier to stores\nincluding Whole Foods. Alexandre cows are pasture-raised, and the operation is\nvalidated by California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF), Certified Humane,\nand the Regenerative Organic Alliance. Its owners, Blake and Stephanie\nAlexandre, won the Organic Farmer of the Year award a few years back and have\nbeen profiled by The New York Times. For $8, you can buy about a third of a\ngallon of its top-shelf milk.\n\nAnnie Lowrey: Radical vegans are trying to change your diet\n\nThe Alexandres sold dozens of grievously ill and injured cows at auction over\nthe past four years, according to a sprawling whistleblower report published\nby the nonprofit advocacy group Farm Forward. On the farm, the report charges,\nmismanagement led to \u201cthe extreme suffering of hundreds of cows.\u201d One\nwhistleblower contacted the local sheriff and the United States Department of\nAgriculture, among other organizations, to report animal-welfare violations,\nbut without results. The report is based on hundreds of location- and date-\ntagged photographs and videos collected over a four-year period by people who\nworked either with or for Alexandre Family Farm, as well as on affidavits,\nveterinary reports, and interviews.\n\n(Justin Maxon for The Atlantic)\n\nAlexandre Family Farm really is a family farm, run by the Alexandres and\nstaffed by some of their children, on multiple sites in Del Norte and Humboldt\nCounties. Blake and Stephanie met while studying at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo\nin the early 1980s, and from there built a pasture-raised empire. Alexandre\u2019s\n4,500 cows, which give birth to 4,000 calves a year, make it one of the\nlargest organic dairy farms in the country.\n\nIn March, I visited the farm to ask the Alexandres about the report. In that\nconversation, they questioned the motivations of the whistleblowers,\nspeculating that they were disgruntled former employees and associates, and\nventured that some of the photographs might have been staged or doctored. They\ndescribed some of the depicted incidents as false, implausible, or\nexaggerated, while saying that others were tragedies or accidents to which\nthey had responded with corrective action. \u201cStuff happens,\u201d Blake told me, as\nwe sat at his kitchen table. \u201cEmployees make mistakes. We make mistakes. We\ntry to fix them when we become aware of them.\u201d\n\nAlexandre is not just any farm; it is esteemed by chefs, politicians, and\nadvocates for humane agriculture, and consumers seek out its products. The\nreport implicates not just the farm but also the certification programs that\nfarms like it use to assure consumers that the food they are eating is\nethically sourced and cruelty-free. And it implicates the government, which\ndoes little to protect the welfare of farm animals. Laws are lax and\nenforcement is even more lax, despite widespread public support for animal\nprotection.\n\nWhen I met Cow 13039, a dying animal sold to the highest bidder, I thought\nthat the system had failed her. But in reporting this story, I found something\nfar more disconcerting. No system had failed her, because there was no system\nto protect her in the first place.\n\none thing is not in dispute: Alexandre cows live a life far better than those\non the mega-operations that produce most of the country\u2019s milk. They eat grass\nand hay instead of pellets made from corn and soybeans. They have daily access\nto pasture and live in herds, rather than being isolated in stalls. (Cows are\nsociable animals\u2014personality-wise, they\u2019re a lot like dogs.)\n\nThe promise of happy, healthy cows has fueled the company\u2019s success. The farm\nwon an award from Whole Foods in 2020 and is one of only six Certified Humane\nbovine-dairy operations in the United States. The Alexandres have become\noutspoken advocates of back-to-the-earth farming; Blake was appointed to a\nstate agricultural committee and is now on a California regenerative-farming\ncommission.\n\nBut many Alexandre cows are neither happy nor healthy, the Farm Forward report\nconcludes. \u201cMost of the whistleblower or undercover investigations that are\ndone on animal farm operations are a couple of videos ... maybe one\nwhistleblower coming forward,\u201d Andrew deCoriolis, Farm Forward\u2019s executive\ndirector, told me. \u201cThe thing that makes this unique is the totality of the\nevidence.\u201d\n\nAnnie Lowrey: What\u2019s different about the Impossible Burger?\n\nThe details in the report are horrifying: a cow with mastitis having her teat\ncut off with a knife. A cow sent to auction with a spinal-cord injury that had\nleft her incontinent and partly paralyzed. A live, alert cow being dragged by\na skid steer. A cow that could not walk being left in a field for two weeks\nbefore being euthanized. Cows sprayed with a caustic combination of mineral\noil and diesel fuel to tamp down on a fly infestation (which, a whistleblower\nsays in the report, they were told to lie about to an inspector).\n\nAt their farm, in a written response, and in a follow-up conversation, the\nAlexandres described such incidents as improbable, given the farm\u2019s protocols.\n\u201cCutting teats off\u201d has \u201cnever been a practice on our dairy farms,\u201d they told\nme. They said that injured cows received medical treatment and when necessary\nwere moved safely, without dragging. A farm worker had mixed red diesel into a\nfly spray, they told me, because that made it easier to see where the spray\nhad been applied, and the farm stopped the practice when management learned\nabout it.\n\nFormer employees said that sick cows were regularly denied antibiotics for\nmastitis and hoof infections, at least in part to maintain their milk as\norganic\u2014a charge corroborated by an Alexandre farm worker not involved in the\nreport. (Once a cow is given antibiotics, her milk must be sold as\nconventional for the duration of her life.) The farm has \u201cnatural\u201d treatments\nthat \u201callow us to not need synthetic antibiotics,\u201d Vanessa Nunes, Blake and\nStephanie\u2019s daughter and a dairy manager at the operation, told me. \u201cWe don\u2019t\nneed to give an antibiotic for mastitis. We have a tincture that we\u2019ll use.\u201d\n(Mastitis can be debilitating when not treated with antibiotics.)\n\nWhistleblowers also said cows with infections had their eyes packed with salt\nand had denim patches glued to their skulls. The farm responded that cows with\npink eye were treated using a saline solution with cod-liver oil, and\nsometimes with apple cider vinegar. The farm said that the denim patch was a\n\u201cgold standard\u201d method to cure pink eye.\n\nJim Reynolds, a large-animal veterinarian, told me that salt would be\n\u201chorrible\u201d to use in any animal\u2019s eye and that patches had no medical benefit,\nand could worsen an infection by trapping dirt and irritating the eye. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know that it\u2019s been recommended since the 1980s,\u201d he said. He told me\nthat the farm\u2019s treatment for eye infections was \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\nDairy cows generally have their horn buds destroyed with a caustic paste or a\nhot iron in the first weeks of life. But the report describes an incident in\nwhich Alexandre let hundreds of calves grow horns and then dehorned them as\nadults with a sawzall, a handheld construction tool. Horns are innervated,\nlike fingers, not inert, like fingernails; the cows were not given anesthetic.\nThe Alexandres said that the employees cut off only the tips of the cows\u2019\nhorns, which are not sensitive, to prevent them from injuring people or other\nanimals, and that it was a onetime event.\n\nLeft: The auction yard where Alexandre Family Farm cows are sold. Right: Cow\n13039, with the denim patch over her eye. (Justin Maxon for The Atlantic;\ncourtesy of the author)\n\nMismanagement at least once led to mass death, the report charges, when hay\ndeliveries ran late. The whistleblowers said the animals were so famished by\nthe time the feed truck arrived that they stampeded, and many were trampled to\ndeath or needed to be euthanized soon after. The Alexandres described this as\na \u201ctragic accident\u201d involving 30 cows who were without food for only a few\nhours after an equipment breakdown; the farm said it had implemented new\nprotocols to prevent anything similar from happening again.\n\nThe farm also contested the notion that it would send ailing cows to auction,\nrather than euthanizing them; the auction facility would not accept such\nanimals, the Alexandres told me, something Leland Mora, the head of the\nauction house, confirmed. Still, on a random Wednesday, I went to that\nauction. And I met an Alexandre cow with what looked like metastatic cancer,\nher eyeball swelling out of her head.\n\nMost American consumers abhor animal cruelty and support laws preventing it.\nIn a recent ASPCA survey, three-quarters or more of respondents said they were\nconcerned about farm-animal welfare and supported a ban on new factory farms.\nYet cruelty, even egregious cruelty, against farm animals is often legal,\nprovided that the suffering is \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201cjustifiable\u201d by the need for\nfarms to produce food, David Rosengard of the Animal Legal Defense Fund told\nme.\n\nTo determine what is \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201cjustifiable,\u201d lawyers and juries often\nlook at what farms are already doing, what agricultural schools are teaching,\nand what Big Ag publications recommend. In effect, I gathered, animal-welfare\nlaw is slanted toward the needs of farms much more than the experience of\nanimals.\n\nEven gratuitously abusive treatment often goes unpunished. Local authorities\nhave jurisdiction over most animal-cruelty complaints. But cows, pigs, and\nchickens are not great at picking up the telephone to call those authorities.\nAnimal-rights activists are able to perform investigations only sporadically,\nand at significant legal risk to themselves. Farm workers, many of whom are\nundocumented immigrants, rarely report violations.\n\nPeter Singer: The meat paradox\n\nPlus, as I learned from speaking with the Alexandres and interviewing the\nwhistleblowers, agricultural communities are tight-knit. The people involved\nin this story have long, complicated histories with one another\u2014personal\ngrievances, financial entanglements, legal disputes. The whistleblowers\ndeclined to be quoted by name, fearing for their livelihoods, save for one, a\nrancher named Ray Christie, who has bought hundreds if not thousands of\nAlexandre cattle. In 2009, after a raid, he was put on two-year probation for\npossessing cockfighting instruments; in 2018, he was charged with felony\nanimal cruelty himself over the state of his cows. (He recently accepted a\nplea bargain, agreeing to misdemeanor littering charges for improperly\ndisposing of animal carcasses.) Given the personalities involved, I focused on\nthe documentary evidence about the cows themselves.\n\nThe condition of some Alexandre cattle spurred one of the whistleblowers to\ntry to get law enforcement involved. In January 2021, the whistleblower told\nHumboldt County Sheriff William F. Honsal that mistreated Alexandre cattle\nwere being sold at auction, and sent him photos and videos of the cows. The\nsheriff responded, saying that he would send a deputy to the auction house;\nthe sheriff\u2019s office later referred the whistleblower to animal control. (The\nsheriff did not respond to requests for comment, and the Alexandres told me\nthey had never been visited by a police officer.)\n\nThe whistleblower also attempted to involve a local state veterinarian, Meghan\nMott. Mott is a mandated reporter of animal abuse, and frequently attended\nauctions at the facility I visited. Why hadn\u2019t she intervened? I could not\nreach her for comment, but Steve Lyle, the director of public affairs at the\nCalifornia Department of Food and Agriculture, told me that the head state\nveterinarian \u201ctries to convey the idea of \u2018if you see something, say\nsomething\u2019 to staff.\u201d But he explained that state veterinarians are\nfunctionally epidemiologists, checking for conditions like influenza. \u201cIf an\nanimal is sick and the cause is not one of the emergency or regulated diseases\nrequiring CDFA action,\u201d care would be the responsibility of the animal\u2019s\nowner, and negligence the responsibility of law enforcement.\n\nFinally, the whistleblower went to the USDA. The agency has regulatory\nauthority over American farms, but does not perform animal-welfare\ninspections. \u201cThere\u2019s a regulatory system in place to make sure that if we eat\na cheeseburger from McDonald\u2019s, we\u2019re not going to get E. coli,\u201d Amanda Hitt,\nthe founder of the Food Integrity Campaign at the Government Accountability\nProject, told me. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen in animal welfare.\u201d\n\nThat said, the USDA does administer the National Organic Program, which\nmandates that animals have \u201csufficient nutrition,\u201d are given \u201cmedicines to\nminimize pain, stress and suffering,\u201d and are \u201cfit for transport\u201d when they\nare sent to slaughter. But the NOP is mainly aimed at environmental\nstewardship. Its humane standards are low, and sometimes counterproductive.\nThe program\u2019s restrictions on the use of antibiotics, for instance\u2014intended to\nprevent farmers from providing the drugs prophylactically, which facilitates\novercrowding and contributes to antibiotic resistance\u2014leads farmers to\nwithhold medicine from sick animals, too. That\u2019s particularly cruel for\nnewborns and recently delivered mothers, who are especially vulnerable to\ninfection. (Other countries do things differently: The European Union allows\norganic dairy cows to get antibiotics up to three times a year.)\n\nAg agencies don\u2019t make great cops. The NOP does not audit farms directly,\ninstead relying on third-party certifiers that farms themselves sometimes\npick, accommodating widespread fraud. California Certified Organic Farmers\nperforms surprise visits, tests for pesticide residue, does intensive\npaperwork audits, and sometimes stakes out farms to make sure animals are\nreally living outside, April Vasquez, CCOF\u2019s chief certification officer, told\nme. But it is also a trade group that promotes organic agriculture and\nfinancially supports at-risk farms; its board is made up of organic farmers.\nStephanie Alexandre sat on it for years.\n\nThe USDA passed the whistleblower\u2019s complaint to the CDFA, which sent a state\nspecial investigator to the Alexandre farm sites in May 2023. A USDA document\nobtained by a Freedom of Information Act request shows that the investigation\nfound no wrongdoing. Talking about fraud in the organic program with a USDA\nofficer, the whistleblower became incensed on behalf of the cows and the\nconsumers shelling out for supposedly high-quality products. \u201cYou got these\nsingle-parent homes, the moms, the young couples, struggling with all the\ninflation going up,\u201d the whistleblower said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to the store,\nspending their money on this stuff, thinking it\u2019s the best thing for their\nkids. And it\u2019s all bullshit!\u201d\n\nA compost pile with cow carcasses at Alexandre Family Farm (Justin Maxon for\nThe Atlantic)\n\nThe regulatory void around animal welfare has been filled by dedicated\nnonprofits offering their own certifications for farms meeting high standards.\nThe godparent of this private system is Adele Douglass Jolley, a former\nemployee of the American Humane Association. In 2000, while touring pig farms\nin the U.K., Jolley learned about the animal-welfare verification program run\nby the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. She cashed out\nher 401(k) to set up a similar program stateside.\n\nNow called Certified Humane, it gives its seal of approval to hundreds of\noperations caring for 417 million animals in 25 countries. Auditors ensure\nthat farms are meeting its standards, which are set by an independent panel of\nexperts. Farms pay a monthly fee, and they (or the companies packaging the\nfood they produce) get to put the Certified Humane logo on their products\u2014and\ncharge consumers more. But the whistleblower report indicates that Alexandre\nwas far out of compliance. Why hadn\u2019t Certified Humane caught the cruelty?\n\nPerhaps because Alexandre does meet the program\u2019s general standards. Its cows\nlive in herds on pasture; they eat grass and hay; they are not given\npreventive antibiotics. Perhaps because the private certification system is\nbased on trust and support as much as verification and skepticism. Audits\ngenerally happen only once a year, in consultation with the farms in question.\nFarmers sometimes know their auditors. Producers found to be out of compliance\nare given a chance to correct the problems.\n\nCertified Humane provided Alexandre with its stamp of approval in early 2021.\n(Some of the incidents in the whistleblower report predate the farm\u2019s\nrelationship with the nonprofit.) In 2022, Certified Humane received a\ncomplaint from one of the whistleblowers about cruelty on the farm. The\ncomplainant had taken photographs of two cows they said had eye injuries, Mimi\nStein, the group\u2019s executive director, told me in an interview. \u201cThese were\nsome very strange pictures,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey were not high quality.\u201d\n\nRead: \u2018Plant-based\u2019 has lost all meaning\n\nWhen Stein called the Alexandres to ask what had happened, they were \u201cupset\u201d\nand \u201cpassionate,\u201d she told me. They said one cow had had an eye damaged after\nsale and the other was \u201cfine, as much as anybody could tell.\u201d Stein\u2019s sense\nwas that the Alexandres \u201cwould have taken care of them and euthanized them on\nsite\u201d had they been severely injured or ill, as Certified Humane requires.\n\nThe organization followed up with an in-person audit, which found no problems.\nBasically, Stein told me, \u201cif animals were that damaged, chances are they\nwouldn\u2019t sell them, because they wouldn\u2019t have any value. It just wouldn\u2019t\nmake any sense.\u201d\n\nAlexandre also touts its certification from the Regenerative Organic Alliance,\nwhich holds farms to even higher animal-welfare standards. Elizabeth Whitlow,\nits executive director, told me that the incidents and practices depicted in\nthe report would represent gross violations of its rules. But I was surprised\nto learn that only a small share of Alexandre cows are actually certified by\nthe group.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t blame a consumer for being bewildered\u2014about what is going on with\nAlexandre products or any others bearing a claim about the conditions in which\nthe animals are raised. There are more than a dozen humane certifiers, some\nwith rigorous standards, some that are just industry fronts. \u201cIt has this\npatina of a Yelp review: five stars for this processor!\u201d Hitt, the founder of\nthe Food Integrity Campaign, told me. \u201cThis is a certification to make you\nfeel better about eating a certain product. But it has no basis in any kind of\nreality.\u201d\n\nIn addition to certification logos, products feature wholesome-sounding but\nhard-to-parse terms: free-roaming, naturally grown, ethically raised. For\nsome, such as free-range, the USDA sets a standard and asks companies for\nevidence of compliance. But enforcement is patchy, and the USDA has in the\npast accepted applications with little or no substantiation. For others, the\nUSDA sets no standards at all. Food manufacturers know they can charge more\nfor products that consumers think are ethical, Dena Jones, who directs the\nfarmed-animal program at the Animal Welfare Institute, told me. So companies\njust \u201cstart slapping\u201d words and logos on things.\n\nThe USDA, to its credit, is tightening up its rules and enforcement. Yet dairy\nwill still \u201cfall through the cracks,\u201d Jones told me. The labels on milk and\nyogurt are the purview of the Food and Drug Administration, not the USDA. And\nthe FDA holds that it has no role in validating animal-raising claims. As far\nas the federal government is concerned, when it comes to milk and the cows\nthat produce it, anyone can claim almost anything.\n\n(Justin Maxon for The Atlantic)\n\nThe Alexandre farm I toured with the family occupies a damp flat between the\nPacific Ocean and an old-growth redwood forest. Hundreds of fat, calm cows\nchewed emerald grass and slept in the mist alongside a herd of wild elk.\nHeavily pregnant cows idled in a spacious barn, overseen 24 hours a day by a\nherdsman. Younger cows rushed up to meet me.\n\nThe farm appeared to provide as close to perfect conditions as possible, I\nthought. Yet dairy is hard\u2014that was something I heard again and again while\nreporting this piece. On ranches, beef cattle live outdoors, mostly\nundisturbed, before being moved to feedlots; mothers and calves spend months\ntogether. In contrast, dairy cows are repeatedly inseminated or bred, calved,\nand separated from their babies. They are milked twice a day. And when their\nbodies begin to give out, they keep getting milked until they are euthanized\nor slaughtered.\n\nJorie Chadbourne, a retired brand inspector (a government official who\nverifies an animal\u2019s ownership at the point of sale or slaughter), told me the\nAlexandre cows she had encountered over the years were no better or worse than\nthose from other organic farms in the region. But, she added, at auction,\norganic cows were usually in worse shape than conventional cows, because of\nthe program\u2019s medication restrictions: \u201cIt is like an older person, at the end\nof their life, not having medicine to comfort them or make them well.\u201d (She\ntold me the antibiotic rules are why she raises her own animals\nconventionally.)\n\nThe best certifiers, like Certified Humane, are great at validating farms\u2019\ngeneral conditions. But, as Mimi Stein noted, the program certifies the\nfarm\u2014not the animal. Cows get sold off. Cruel incidents happen. And many other\ncertifiers are less rigorous.\n\nRead: The evidence for a vegan diet\n\nWhat is a consumer who wants to support a gentle, green system of agriculture\nto do? DeCoriolis of Farm Forward had a blunt answer: Give up dairy. \u201cAs a\nconsumer, you\u2019re just playing roulette,\u201d he told me. Yet the overwhelming\nmajority of American consumers are unwilling to give up milk or cheese for\nethical reasons. What they are willing to do is support stricter rules for\nagricultural producers and pay more for milk and cheese from farms that treat\ntheir animals well. The country is failing to provide those consumers with a\nreliable and navigable system. That\u2019s a policy problem, and a solvable one.\n\nAt a minimum, the USDA should require third-party certification of animal-\nwelfare and animal-raising claims, and apply strict regulations to certifiers:\npreventing conflicts of interest, requiring surprise inspections, and cracking\ndown on rubber-stamping of industry norms. To meet American consumers\u2019 more\nambitious demands, Congress should create a farmed-animal welfare standard and\nan agency separate from the USDA to enforce it, akin to the Consumer Product\nSafety Commission.\n\nSuch changes would improve the welfare of billions of animals in our food\nsystem. Yet any changes would be too late for one. In the end, nobody stepped\nin to aid Cow 13039\u2014not law enforcement, not the state veterinarians, not the\nauction employees. Alexandre Family Farm gave her vitamins and an eye patch,\nNunes told me. They should have sold her sooner, she said. Cow 13039 was\nailing. And ailing cows are not worth much.\n\nThey are worth something, though. At auction, Cow 13039 got 10 cents a pound.\nFor $119, less auction fees, she spent the final moments of her life not\ngrazing on pasture with her herd but isolated, hungry, terrified, and in pain.\nRay Christie\u2019s brother, also a rancher, had purchased her. But she was too\nsick to have her eye excised. At the slaughterhouse, her carcass would have\nbeen condemned.\n\nThe morning after I met her, a farmhand shot her between her blighted eyes.\n\nGisela Salim-Peyer contributed reporting to this story.\n\nAnnie Lowrey is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
