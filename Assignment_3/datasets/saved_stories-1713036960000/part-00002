We didn't say\nproductively\n\n5\n\n## Dev teams must beware inflated expectations of tech leadership, Gartner\nwarns\n\nLindsay Clark\n\nSat 13 Apr 2024 // 10:30 UTC\n\nGlobal tech research company Gartner estimates that by 2028, 75 percent of\nenterprise software engineers will use AI code assistants, up from less than\n10 percent in early 2023.\n\nAs of the third quarter of 2023, 63 percent of organizations were piloting,\ndeploying or had already deployed AI code assistants, said the survey of 598\nsoftware engineering leaders at large enterprises.\n\nHowever, Philip Walsh, Gartner senior principal analyst, warns that there can\nbe a mismatch between IT leadership's expectations and software teams'\nexperience when it comes to productivity uptick.\n\nHe said vendors selling AI-assisted coding tools were claiming they could\nincrease coder productivity by as much as 50 percent, while a third of CIOs\n(34 percent) and technology leaders thought AI code generation might be a\n\"game changer\" for their software development efforts.\n\n\"That's some really high expectations from the productivity gains from these\nAI code assistants,\" he said.\n\n> While the popularity of AI coding tools will undoubtedly increase,\n> development teams might need to manage the expectations of their senior\n> managers ... 'They're not going to hear it from the vendors'\n\nBut looking more closely at the vendors' claims reveals that the benefits of\nAI-powered coding tools can be confined to quite narrow tasks. For example,\none study relied on an A-B style experiment where a team writing a web server\nin JavaScript was pitted against another that also employed AI coding tools.\nWriting a boilerplate for Python was another common comparison task, he said.\n\nBut these tasks might not be representative of the tool's abilities because of\nthe abundance of training data online demonstrating how coders had already\ntackled the problems.\n\nAt the same time, coding itself did not make up the majority of effort in the\nwhole software development lifecycle, Walsh said.\n\n\"There are a whole variety of tasks [involved in software development] from\nplanning, design, research, and actual code generation and development ...\nthen a lot of testing and verification, and then deployment, configuration,\nand monitoring. Even if you're getting 50 percent faster task completion [on\ncoding], that's only going to be 50 percent of 20 percent. So that means only\n10 percent greater improvement in overall cycle time,\" he said.\n\n  * Forcing AI on developers is a bad idea that is going to happen\n  * Google's AI-fueled IDE Project IDX tries to show you how your app runs on Android, iOS\n  * IBM takes a crack at 'utility scale' quantum processing with Heron processor\n  * IBM says GenAI can convert that old COBOL code to Java for you\n\nWhile the popularity of AI coding tools will undoubtedly increase, development\nteams might need to manage the expectations of their senior managers.\n\n\"They're not going to hear it from the vendors,\" Walsh said. \"Hopefully, their\ndevelopers and the engineering leaders are going to tell them and they're\ngoing to listen. What we do not recommend is some kind of top-down\nproductivity mandate. That doesn't work.\"\n\nHe said development teams need the freedom to figure out the best use cases.\nThey need to work in a learning culture of experimentation, with the freedom\nto fail to get the most from the new tools.\n\n\"CIOs need to create that culture and listen to their people, but also create\nthat space for experimentation and failure,\" he said. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Gartner\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Gartner\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n5 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Gartner\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Gartner\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Ethernet advances will end Nvidia's InfiniBand lead in AI networks\n\nDesire to build brainboxes will also see optical interconnects go mainstream\n\nNetworks9 days | 7\n\n#### Google Cloud chief is really psyched about this AI thing\n\nCloud Next We're on a highway to ML\n\nPaaS + IaaS4 days | 6\n\n#### Tech titans assemble to decide which jobs AI should cut first\n\nBut don't worry, if tech takes your job, we'll retrain you\n\nAI + ML9 days | 64\n\n#### A different view from the edge\n\nHow Dell NativeEdge provides the single pane of glass which harmonizes your IT\nand OT perspective\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Intel CEO suggests AI can help to create a one-person Unicorn\n\nIntel Vision And possibly replace entire business units too\n\nAI + ML3 days | 36\n\n#### Microsoft rolls out safety tools for Azure AI.
