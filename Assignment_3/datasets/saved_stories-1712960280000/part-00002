The dataset features 5100 songs and includes\nranking, song name, artist, year, lyrics, and source for each song. Source #1\nis metrolyrics.com, source #2 is songlyrics.com, and source #3 is\nlyricsmode.com. Lyrics for 187 songs were unavailable. The songs are ranked\nfrom 1-100 for each year. The song titles, artist names, and lyrics are\nincluded without capitalization or punctuation.\n\n## Hypotheses\n\nWe explored several hypotheses while analyzing this data set. Specifically, we\nlooked at the differences among word count, average number of unique words per\nsong, top 15 words used, popular two- or three-word phrases, and sentimental\nwords for each decade. We were more interested in learning about trends behind\nthe lyrics rather than trends behind artists or song names. Our null\nhypothesis is that regardless of the decade, the word count, average number of\nunique words per song, top 15 words used, top bigrams and trigrams, and\nproportion of sentimental words will remain the same. Overall, our alternative\nhypothesis is that the word count, average number of unique words per song,\ntop 15 words used, popular two-word or three-word phrases, and proportion of\nsentimental words changes each decade.\n\nThe first hypothesis we are testing is that the top 15 words, top two-word\nphrases, and top three-word phrases have changed over the decades, with more\nprofanity and less sophisticated words with each passing decade. However, we\nalso hypothesize that common themes in songs will stay the same.\n\nThe second hypothesis we are testing is that the number of unique words will\ndecrease each decade, indicating that songs are becoming more repetitive.\n\nThe third hypothesis we are testing is that the proportion of positive\nsentiment words and negative words are different in each decade, so we can\naccurately predict a song\u2019s decade with a decision tree based on how similar\nits own proportion of positive or negative words is to a particular decade.\n\n## Methodology\n\n### Original Plan\n\nLooking at our data set for the first time, we wanted to mainly do text\nanalysis on the song lyrics. We wanted to determine how popular words,\nphrases, and topics changed with each decade. To visualize the data, we would\ncreate bar charts and word clouds. We also wanted to determine average word\ncount for each decade and look into song repetitiveness over time. Finally, we\nwanted to determine how sentiments and the way people talk about certain\ntopics change over time (i.e. how lyrics about love have changed.) However, we\nweren\u2019t able to do so because understanding how a certain topic is discussed\nwould require looking at the full song instead of individual words or phrases.\n\n### Visualizations\n\n#### Bar Charts\n\nWe used bar charts to display each decade\u2019s top 15 words, as well as the word\ncount for each word. The Y-axis was labeled \u201cWord\u201d to signify the top 15 most\nused words, and the X-axis was labeled \u201cCount\u201d to display the number of times\nthe word was used that decade. A bar chart was also used to display the eight\nwords with the highest tf-idf ratio in each decade.\n\n#### Word Clouds\n\nFor our word clouds, we included the top 75 most used words per decade. Larger\nword font size indicates higher word count in that decade.\n\n#### Line Graph\n\nAdditionally, we used a line graph to track the count of five popular words\n(love, baby, time, yeah, girl) across each decade.\n\n### Data Cleaning\n\nThe data was mostly straightforward, but it required some cleaning and\nseparation into different data sets. First, we omitted the \u201cNA\u201ds and blank\nspaces from the dataset. Then, we created vectors for each decade, filtering\nthe appropriate years into the appropriate vector. Using this, we created\nseparate datasets for the song lyrics of different decades. We created a list\nof new stop words, such as \u201cdont,\u201d \u201cim,\u201d \u201cyoure,\u201d \u201cill,\u201d \u201cgonna,\u201d \u201caint,\u201d\n\u201cive,\u201d \u201cyoull,\u201d and \u201cwont.\u201d We then combined this custom list of stop words\nwith the default of list words. Then, we removed the stop words from each\ndecade\u2019s dataset. Finally, we separated the lyric words into one word per row.\n\nThe data also includes two different variations for artist collaborations.\nNewer songs include the word \u201cfeaturing\u201d before featured artists, while older\nsongs just have a space between two artists. However, we did not clean this\ndata variation because it did not affect any of our visualizations or models.\nIn addition, we did not correct spelling errors or derivatives, such as\n\u201cnight\u201d vs. \u201cnite\u201d or \u201cthingll\u201d instead of \u201cthing will\u201d because it did not\nsignificantly affect our results.\n\n## Results\n\n### 1960\u2019s\n\nFirst, we created a vector called \u201cSixties\u201d and included the years of the\n1960\u2019s, starting with 1965 (the first available year of data). Then, we\ncreated a separate dataset called \u201cSixtieslyrics\u201d and filtered the \u201csongs\u201d\ndata frame for rows that included the years in our \u201cSixties\u201d vector. Because\nour \u201cSixties\u201d vector only includes five years, our data and visualizations are\nnot representative of the entire decade.\n\nThen, we created another dataset called \u201cSixtieswords\u201d in which we separated\neach word in the lyrics column of our \u201cSixtieslyrics\u201d dataset into a separate\nrow. After, we created a data frame that included both the default list of\nstop words and a custom list of stop words. Before determining the number of\ntimes each word was used in the 1960s, we removed the words in our \u201cstopwords\u201d\ndata frame from the \u201cSixtieswords\u201d dataset in order to prevent commonly used\nwords such as \u201cthe\u201d from appearing in our word count data.\n\nWe also removed the words in our \u201cstopwords\u201d data frame before creating\nbigrams and trigrams. This prevents commonly used words such as \u201cis\u201d from\nappearing in our two-word and three-word phrases.\n\nOur first visualization is a bar chart with a list and count of the most\ncommonly used words in lyrics in Billboard\u2019s \u201cYear-End Hot 100\u201d for the years\n1965-1969 only.\n\nOur second visualization is a word cloud of the top 75 most commonly used\nwords in the top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 1965-1969. Similar to the bar chart\nlisting the most commonly used words and count in descending order, \u201clove\u201d is\ngiven the largest word font size, then \u201cbaby\u201d and \u201cyeah.\u201d\n\nOur third visualization is a bar chart with the most commonly used bigrams in\nthe top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 1965 and 1969. This data indicates that lots\nof repetition of single words was utilized in the most popular songs. Our list\nof bigrams may not be reflective of the decade because the most common bigrams\nmay have come from one song only in which there was lots of repetition of key\nphrases.\n\nOur fourth visualization is a bar chart with the most commonly used trigrams\nbetween 1965 and 1969.The order is similar to that of the bigrams, but a few\nof the phrases have switched orders after increasing to a three-word phrase.\nIn addition, the most commonly used trigrams are still often the repeat of a\nsingle word. This data further indicates that lots of repetition of single\nwords was utilized in popular songs. Once again, our list of trigrams may not\nbe reflective of the decade because the most common trigrams may have come\nfrom one song only in which lots of repetition of key phrases occurred.\n\nBecause many songs include repetition of words, we also wanted to find the\naverage number of unique words per song. The average number of unique words\nper song in our 1960\u2019s dataset is 183.296.\n\n### 1970\u2019s\n\nFor the 1970\u2019s data, we created a vector called \u201cSeventies\u201d and included the\nyears of the 1970\u2019s, starting with 1970. Then, we created a separate dataset\ncalled \u201cSeventieslyrics\u201d and filtered the \u201csongs\u201d data frame for rows that\nincluded the years in our \u201cSeventies\u201d vector.\n\nWe then repeated the process that was taken for the 1960s data set, except\nthat all variable names including the word \u201cSixties\u201d were changed to use the\nword \u201cSeventies.\u201d\n\nOur first visualization is a bar chart with a list and count of the most\ncommonly used words in lyrics in Billboard\u2019s \u201cYear-End Hot 100\u201d for the years\n1970 to 1979 only. The top two words are the same for both the 1960s and\n1970s, and most of the top 15 words in the 1970s were also popular words in\nthe 1960s, albeit in different order.\n\nOur second visualization is a word cloud of the top 75 most commonly used\nwords in the top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 1970 and 1979.\n\nOur third visualization is a bar chart with the most commonly used bigrams in\nthe top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 1970 and 1979 Like the 1960\u2019s data, this\ndata indicates that lots of repetition of single words was utilized in the\nmost popular songs.\n\nOur fourth visualization is a bar chart with the most commonly used\ntrigrams.The order is similar to that of the bigrams, but a few of the phrases\nhave switched orders after increasing to a three-word phrase. In addition, the\nmost commonly used trigrams are the repeat of a single word. This data\nsuggests that lots of repetition of single words or two-word phrases was\nutilized in popular songs. This visualization also indicates that many of the\nmost common phrases are actually sounds rather than words; because of this,\nour visualization may be slightly inaccurate in terms of common phrases. Our\nvisualization may also be inaccurate due to similar phrases in our bar chart;\nfor example, \u201cbeach baby beach\u201d is essentially the same as \u201cbaby beach baby\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, the average number of unique words per song in our 1970s dataset\nis 213.987. This is almost thirty words higher than the average number of\nunique words per song in our 1960s dataset, indicating that the top 100 songs\nbecame longer and/or less repetitive in the 1970s.\n\n### 1980\u2019s\n\nWe repeated the same process of analysis but changed variable names to reflect\nthe eighties.\n\nOur first visualization is a bar chart with a list and count of the most\ncommonly used words in lyrics in Billboard\u2019s \u201cYear-End Hot 100\u201d for the years\n1980 to 1989 only. The top five words are the same for both the 1970s and\n1980s, and most of the top 15 words in the 1980\u2019s were also popular words in\nthe 1970\u2019s, albeit in different order.\n\nOur second visualization is a word cloud of the top 75 most commonly used\nwords in the top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 1980 and 1989.\n\nOur third visualization is a bar chart with the most commonly used bigrams in\nthe top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 1980 and 1989. This data again indicates\nthat lots of repetition of single words was utilized in the most popular\nsongs.\n\nOur fourth visualization is a bar chart with the most commonly used trigrams\nin the top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 1980 and 1989.\n\nAdditionally, the average number of unique words per song in our 1980\u2019s\ndataset is 260.838. This is almost 50 words higher than the average number of\nunique words per song in our 1970s dataset, and almost 80 words higher than\nthe 1960\u2019s dataset. This suggests that the top 100 songs became longer and/or\nless repetitive in the 1980\u2019s.\n\n### 1990\u2019s\n\nWe repeated the same process of analysis but changed variable names to reflect\nthe nineties.\n\nOur first visualization is a bar chart with a list and count of the most\ncommonly used words in lyrics in Billboard\u2019s \u201cYear-End Hot 100\u201d for the years\n1990 to 1999 only.\n\nOur second visualization is a word cloud of the top 75 most commonly used\nwords in the top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 1990 and 1999.\n\nOur third visualization is a bar chart with the most commonly used bigrams in\nthe top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 1990 and 1999.\n\nOur fourth visualization is a bar chart with the most commonly used trigrams\nin the top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 1990 and 1999.\n\nAdditionally, the average number of unique words per song in our 1990s dataset\nis 346.413. This is higher than the average number of unique words per song in\nour 1980\u2019s dataset, again suggesting that songs became less repetitive in the\n1990\u2019s.\n\n### 2000\u2019s\n\nWe repeated the same process of analysis but changed variable names to reflect\nthe thousands.\n\nOur first visualization is a bar chart with a list and count of the most\ncommonly used words in lyrics in Billboard\u2019s \u201cYear-End Hot 100\u201d for the years\n2000 to 2009 only.\n\nOur second visualization is a word cloud of the top 75 most commonly used\nwords in the top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 2000 and 2009.\n\nOur third visualization is a bar chart with the most commonly used bigrams in\nthe top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 2000 and 2009.\n\nOur fourth visualization is a bar chart with the most commonly used trigrams\nin the top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 2000 and 2009.\n\nAdditionally, the average number of unique words per song in our 2000\u2019s\ndataset is 453.563. This is a significant increase of over 100 words compared\nto the average number of unique words per song in our 1990\u2019s dataset. This\nsuggests that songs became longer and/or less repetitive in the 2000\u2019s.\n\n### 2010\u2019s\n\nWe repeated the same process of analysis but changed variable names to reflect\nthe thousand-tens. Because our \u201cThousandtens\u201d vector only includes five years,\nour data and visualizations are not representative of the entire decade.\n\nOur first visualization is a bar chart with a list and count of the most\ncommonly used words in lyrics in Billboard\u2019s \u201cYear-End Hot 100\u201d for the years\n2010 to 2015 only.\n\nOur second visualization is a word cloud of the top 75 most commonly used\nwords in the top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 2010 and 2015.\n\nOur third visualization is a bar chart with the most commonly used bigrams in\nthe top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 2010 and 2015.\n\nOur fourth visualization is a bar chart with the most commonly used trigrams\nin the top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics between 2010 and 2015.\n\n    \n    \n    ## [1] \"C/C/C/C/C/en_US.UTF-8\"\n\nAdditionally, the average number of unique words per song in our 2010\u2019s\ndataset is 244.785. This is a huge decrease of more than 200 words compared to\nthe average number of unique words per song in our 2000\u2019s dataset; instead, it\nis more on par with the average numbers in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s datasets.\nThis suggests that songs became shorter and/or more repetitive in the 2010\u2019s.\n\n### TF-IDF\n\nAfter these visualizations, we wanted to calculate \u201cterm frequency-inverse\ndocument frequency\u201d (tf-idf) scores in order to determine how significant a\nword was to a specific decade. A high tf-idf score meant that a specific term\nwas only common in one decade. Our tf-idf plots show the eight words with the\nhighest tf-idf scores for each decade. The nineties and later decades began to\ninclude more profanity and racially charged words.\n\n### Unique Words\n\nAfter finding the mean number of unique words for each decade, we wanted to\nplot this data in an easily understandable visualization. The plot shows a\nrelatively linear increase in mean unique word count until the 2010s, where\nthe mean number of unique words drops to almost half of the previous decade.\n\n### Popularity of Most Common Words\n\nFinally, we created a line plot to demonstrate how usage of the most popular\nwords changes over time. We examined the word counts for \u201clove,\u201d \u201cbaby,\u201d\n\u201cyeah,\u201d \u201cgirl,\u201d and \u201ctime.\u201d Each word shows a similar general trend: word\nusage increases for a few decades, then begins to decrease around the 1990s.\nThe exception is the word \u201cgirl\u201d, which sharply increases in the 1990\u2019s and\nsharply decreases in the 2000\u2019s.\n\n## Classification\n\nWe wanted to build a classifier using a decision tree in order to see whether\nit can predict which decade a song falls in based on the proportion of\nnegative and positive words..\n\nWe chose the classification method of decision trees because decision trees\nare easy to interpret visually, are simple to generate rules, can handle\ncategorical features well, and can trace relationships between events. We\nwanted to create an easily understandable visual in which the reader could\nidentify the relationship between song sentiment and song decade.\n\nUnfortunately, our decision tree had a low predictive accuracy of 26.06\npercent, indicating that our feature could not accurately predict the song\ndecade.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThrough our data analysis, we found evidence that:\n\n  1. The top 15 words have remained relatively the same over the decades. \u201cLove\u201d was the most commonly used word in popular song lyrics in every decade. Other wors, such as \u201cgirl\u201d and \u201ctime\u201d were also in the top ten every decade. Furthermore, starting with the 1990\u2019s, more songs included profanity and less sophisticated words that were not present in previous decades. All of this analysis suggests that our first hypothesis was correct.\n\n  2. The top 100 songs\u2019 lyrics include lots of repetition, as seen through bigrams and trigrams. This may be because it can make a song more popular, catchy, and memorable. Unique word count increased until the 2010\u2019s, where the average number of unique words in a song decreased by almost 50 percent compared to the prior decade. This suggests longer and/or less repetitive songs until the 2010\u2019s. Our second hypothesis was only accurate for the 2010\u2019s, as our data actually suggested that song repetitiveness was decreasing until then.\n\n  3. The proportion of positive sentiment words and negative sentiment words remains similar throughout the decades. A decision tree based on the proportion of positive and negative sentiment words was not ideal for accurately predicting a song\u2019s decade. This suggests that our third hypothesis was incorrect.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
