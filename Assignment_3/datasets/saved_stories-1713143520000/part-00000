Once the exclusive source of news for people across the\nworld, newspapers today are confronting greater competition from more places\nthan ever before. At the same time, there is growing concern that journalism\non the internet is failing to uphold the basic values of journalism and that\nAmerican democracy is increasingly at risk due to the lack of quality\ninformation.\n\nAt the heart of our analysis is the notion of the Fourth Estate, a term coined\nby Edmund Burke to describe how journalism acted as a fourth branch of\ngovernment, holding public officials accountable and informing citizens of\nprominent issues. This mission has been at the heart of the journalistic\nenterprise for the past few centuries. The question today is whether new forms\nof news like social media and blogging represent a better form of the Fourth\nEstate, or whether the decline in print media is leading to a simultaneous\ndecline in the robustness of this unofficial branch.\n\nThis website analyses the trends that are taking place today in journalism. We\nbegin by looking at what the Fourth Estate is, and what it means for the\npractice of journalism. Next, we present a lengthy history of print journalism\nin America, to provide the context needed to understand the changes underway\nin the digital age. Third, we include an analysis of the economics of\njournalism, followed by an exploration of the effects of how journalism has\nbeen affected by the internet. Finally, we have conducted five interviews with\njournalists that are confronting the digital age themselves to give a real\nlook at how the internet is changing the practice of journalism today.\n\nComments are closed.\n\nJournalism in the Digital Age -- a project for CS181 by Danny Crichton, Ben\nChristel, Aaditya Shidham, Alex Valderrama, Jeremy Karmel\n\n", "frontpage": true}
