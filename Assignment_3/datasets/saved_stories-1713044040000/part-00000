Ulrich Baumgarten via Getty Images\n\nFor most aspiring artists, getting work onto the walls of prominent museums\ntakes time, patience and talent. But for one German museum employee, all it\ntook was a few screws.\n\nOn February 26, a technician smuggled his own painting into Munich\u2019s\nPinakothek der Moderne and hung it on a gallery wall. According to the German\nnewspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, the 51-year-old man believed it would be his\n\u201cartistic breakthrough.\u201d Instead, he may be facing prison time.\n\n\u201cThe employee considers himself as an artist and most likely saw his role in\nthe museum\u2019s installation team as a day job to support his true calling,\u201d a\nspokesperson for the museum tells the Guardian\u2019s Philip Oltermann.\n\nThe Pinakothek der Moderne features famous artists such as Pablo Picasso,\nWassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee and Andy Warhol. Its collection of 20,000 works\nis one of the largest in Germany.\n\nDue to the nature of his job, the man was able to access the gallery even when\nit was closed. He snuck his painting into the museum while he was helping\ninstall an exhibition on architecture and philanthropy.\n\n\u201cHe was carrying tools, that\u2019s why he went totally unnoticed,\u201d Tine Nehler, a\nmuseum spokesperson, tells the New York Times\u2019 Christopher F. Schuetze. \u201cAs a\ntechnician, he was able to move around all areas of the building outside of\nopening hours.\u201d\n\nMuseum officials haven\u2019t given a description of the painting but noted it\nmeasured around 24 by 47 inches. The man attached the painting to the\nexhibition wall with two screws, leaving behind drill holes. Per the Guardian,\nstaffers quickly noticed something was awry. They left the work in place until\nthe end of the day.\n\n\u201cThe total damage is estimated at around \u20ac100 ($107). The picture has since\nbeen removed and confiscated,\u201d Christian Drexler, chief superintendent of the\nMunich Police, tells CNN\u2019s Emily Blumenthal and Chris Stern.\n\nA few weeks ago, a similar incident occurred at the Bundeskunsthalle in Bonn,\nGermany, when a student used double-sided tape to stick one of her paintings\nonto a gallery wall. Staffers didn\u2019t notice the painting until they dismantled\nthe exhibition it was hanging in. \u201cWe think it\u2019s funny and we want to get to\nknow the artist,\u201d wrote the museum in a translated post on X (formerly\nTwitter). \u201cSo get in touch! There\u2019s no trouble. Word of honor.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, for the aspiring artist in Munich, officials are taking a less\nlighthearted approach. According to Drexler, the employee confessed his\nactions via email after the painting was discovered. The museum then fired the\nartist and reported his actions to the police. He is under investigation for\nproperty damage\u2014and if he is convicted, he could face up to two years in\nprison, per CNN.\n\nThis outcome is likely not the \u201cartistic breakthrough\u201d the man envisioned.\nWhile museum officials aren\u2019t commenting on the quality of the artwork, a\nspokesperson tells the Guardian that they \u201cdid not receive any positive\nfeedback on the addition from visitors to the gallery.\u201d\n\nGet the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.\n\nJulia Binswanger | READ MORE\n\nJulia Binswanger is a freelance arts and culture reporter based in Chicago.\nHer work has been featured in WBEZ, Chicago magazine, Rebellious magazine and\nPC magazine.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1.
