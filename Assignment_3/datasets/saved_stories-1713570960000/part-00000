Bickel/AP)\n\nListen\n\n3 min\n\nShare\n\nComment755\n\nSave\n\nGoogle has announced new features in its Maps app designed to help electric-\ncar drivers find a charge.\n\nThe updates include a tool to help drivers find nearby chargers with real-time\ninformation about availability and charging speed, the ability to find\ncharging stops on longer road trips and more detailed instructions about how\nto find chargers within parking lots and garages.\n\nGoogle expects to start rolling out these features \u201cin the coming months,\u201d\naccording to a blog post. Some will come first to people who drive a car that\ncomes with \u201cGoogle Built-in,\u201d the company\u2019s driver-assistance software. Google\nupdated its other route-finding app, Waze, with information on EV chargers\nlast month.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe update addresses one of Americans\u2019 top concerns about owning an electric\nvehicle: finding a place to charge. Range anxiety remains a significant\nbarrier for EV sales \u2014 especially for drivers who don\u2019t own a house. Among\npeople who don\u2019t drive an EV, roughly half say they think finding a place to\ncharge would be \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d difficult, according to a 2023\nWashington Post-University of Maryland poll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEVs make up roughly 7 percent of new U.S. car sales, which some experts\nbelieve is a tipping point at which electric cars will quickly become popular\nand take over the market. But lately, the EV market appears to be cooling off.\nSales slowed in the first quarter of this year.\n\nIn addition to building more charging stations, companies can make driving an\nEV easier by building apps that help drivers find chargers, said Stephanie\nValdez Streaty, director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive. \u201cThat could\nbe really helpful with mitigating some of those concerns about charging\nanxiety,\u201d she said.\n\n###\n\nFind available EV charging stations\n\nFor electric-car drivers who need a last-minute charge, Google is developing a\nfeature that can find nearby chargers with updated information about how many\nports are available and their charging speed. The company says this feature\nwill eventually be available to all drivers but will be available first for\ndrivers with Google Built-in.\n\nFollow Climate & environment\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n###\n\nPlan a road trip with EV charging stops\n\nThe Maps update will allow EV owners with Google Built-in to plan where they\ncan power up when taking long trips with multiple stops, such as a cross-\ncountry road trip. The feature will access information about your car\u2019s\nbattery life to suggest the best places to charge up.\n\nThe company also announced a search feature that allows travelers to look for\nhotels with electric-car chargers.\n\n###\n\nLocate hard-to-find EV charging stations\n\nSome EV chargers are tucked in hard-to-find corners of parking garages. The\nMaps updates will crowdsource information from Google reviewers to generate\nmore detailed instructions about how to get to a charger. According to the\ncompany\u2019s blog post, the instructions might read something like, \u201cEnter the\nunderground parking lot and follow the signs toward the exit. Just before\nexiting, turn right.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nFeel-good stories\n\nNews that brims with optimism\n\nHe spent 20 years trying to buy back his grandma\u2019s \u2018Passionate Pink\u2019 Mustang\n\nHe forgave the man who killed his son, and helped free him from prison\n\nSeeking motivation, high school athletes run with shelter dogs\n\nback\n\nTry a different topic\n\nSign in or create a free account to save your preferences\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n", "frontpage": true}
