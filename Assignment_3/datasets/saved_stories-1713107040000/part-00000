Has anyone here read about the study from the University of Richmond about how enriched environments affect stress responses? \ud83e\udd14 In it, scientists taught rats to drive tiny cars, and found the experience of learning and acquiring mastery over a new skill decreased their stress hormones. \ud83e\udde0\u263a\ufe0f Kuzko and Kronk are definitely happy, curious boys and lifelong learners\u2026 but we had no idea they\u2019d get the same opportunity to challenge themselves until my mechanically-gifted dad surprised us with two little cars for them that he\u2019d built himself!! \ud83e\udd29 The controls are pretty straightforward: middle pedal goes forward, left pedal turns the car left, right pedal turns it right. \ud83d\ude98 It really didn\u2019t take Kuzko and Kronk long to experiment with their new hot rods. At first we rewarded them for any interaction with the buttons. \ud83d\ude4c Then, as they began to make associations with what each button did, we slowly increased the threshold of accuracy required before they got their treat. Eventually, they came to understand their task was to manoeuvre the car so that the portholes in the windshield aligned with wherever we held a delicious rice puff. \ud83e\udded After only a couple months of 5-10 minute lessons each day, we\u2019ve been blown away by how skilled Kuzko and Kronk have become at accurately turning and accelerating their cars! True to the study, they do seem to enjoy their nightly practice. We removed the back doors a while ago to give them full autonomy, and now when the cars come out the rats are quick to jump in on their own and hit the gas! \ud83e\udd20 There\u2019s way more great footage of these two speedsters to come, so stay tuned for future reels showcasing the advancements Kuzko and Kronk are making in their driving prowess! \ud83e\udd17 #rescuerats #adoptdontshop #ratrods #ratstagram #ratsofinstagram #rats\"", "source_text": "And now the debut of an exciting new talent Kuzko and Kronk have been working on behind the scenes.... \ud83c\udfce\ufe0f That\u2019s right: These tw... | Instagram\n\n", "frontpage": true}
