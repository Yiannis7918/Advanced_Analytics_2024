Is anything on the domain working for you? It is a\nrelatively new domain so some dns providers will block the requests when\ncertain safety features are turned on. Notably I had this issue with nextdns.  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\ngasparnagy commented Mar 13, 2024\n\nIt is also working for me, but someone else have reported the same issue to me\nper email. The domain is more than a month old.Maybe related: Kaspersky\nclassified our documentation site as \"pishing\", because the site is hosted (by\nReadTheDocs) on a server where someone else published some malware.I have\nreported the issue both for Kaspersky and ReadTheDocs on Monday.I have\nreceived a response from Kaspersky today that they excluded us from our data\nloss threat protection databases.I haven't received a solution from\nReadTheDocs yet, but maybe they are currently reconfiguring the\nservers...@MarkvTurnhout: I have a few questions\n\n  * Do you have some special security app that might have blocked the site?\n  * Could you run a ping docs.reqnroll.net and let me know the IP address of the server on your machine?\n  * Could you please also try from another network (e.g. from your mobile with wifi off)?\n\n  \n---  \n  \nAuthor\n\n###\n\nMarkvTurnhout commented Mar 14, 2024\n\nFrom my work laptop the ping doesn't work, I just tried outside the network\n(on my phone) and it works.So it seems to be a internal thingy. I will ask the\nnetwork guys if they can allow it.Thank you for the quick response!  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\ngasparnagy commented Mar 14, 2024\n\n@MarkvTurnhout thx. please report it back here if it was really an internal\nthing.  \n---  \n  \nAuthor\n\n###\n\nMarkvTurnhout commented Mar 19, 2024\n\nI just got word back from our IT department. It seems that we do not support\nIPv6 addresses,I did a ping from my local laptop:I don't know if it is\npossible to also host / broadcast the docs.reqnroll.net page with / on IPv4? I\ndon't have a lot of knowledge about this so I don't know if it is possible?  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\ngasparnagy commented Mar 19, 2024\n\n@MarkvTurnhout thx for the info. I don't really understand this, because\ndocs.reqnroll.net does have an IPv4 address as well. For me ping does use\nthat.  \n---  \n  \nAuthor\n\n###\n\nMarkvTurnhout commented Mar 25, 2024\n\nI have to admit this goes further then my knowledge about this subject :P.We\nhave send it back to our IT Department, hopefully they have a way forward.\nI'll get back on this issue.  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\ngasparnagy commented Mar 25, 2024\n\n@MarkvTurnhout In the meantime I tried to convince all security providers to\nclear the malicious flag from docs.reqnroll.net and it goes well. There is\nonly one that has not processed my request yet (see report).  \n---  \n  \nCollaborator\n\n###\n\najeckmans commented Apr 3, 2024\n\nJust a heads up that on the Odido mobile network (https://www.odido.nl/) in\nthe Netherlands (formerly T-Mobile NL) the docs.reqnroll.net site also won't\nload.  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\ngasparnagy commented Apr 8, 2024\n\n@ajeckmans Any chance that you can contact Odido support to get info on \"why\"\nit is not available there? I feel that there is a problem, but we still don't\nknow what it is. I guess the website (reqnroll.net) is loading, right?  \n---  \n  \nCollaborator\n\n###\n\najeckmans commented Apr 8, 2024\n\nYes the regular website is loading just fine. I can try but their servicedesk\nis not known for their technical expertise..  \n---  \n  \nCollaborator\n\n###\n\najeckmans commented Apr 11, 2024\n\n@gasparnagy Just connected my pc via odido mobile network to try and get some\ntracing and of course it started working. I'm hoping the same goes for\n@MarkvTurnhout as well.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nmooragor commented Apr 15, 2024 \u2022\n\nFollowing up here from https://github.com/orgs/reqnroll/discussions/102 My\nphone can indeed access the docs websites. Am raising a ticket with my ISP to\ntry and find out why the docs are being blocked. Don't hold your breath\nwaiting for a meaningful reply! :)\nhttps://community.plus.net/t5/Broadband/Access-Denied-to-a-sub-\nwebsite/td-p/1966142  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nmooragor commented Apr 15, 2024\n\nSo - someone replied there that on the same ISP their iPad worked and desktop\ndidn't. They had 'Malwarebytes' security software. I have company mandated\n'Netscope' - and turning that off temporarily allowed the page to load. I'll\ntry a support ticket with the company's IT people to see if they can get an\nanswer from Netscope on why it's blocked.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nmooragor commented Apr 15, 2024\n\nApparently Malwarebytes is classifying the website as 'riskware' - for an\nunknown reason. I'll see what our IT says about the reason for Netscope not\nliking it - probably the same 'blacklist' - no clue at all how you'd manage to\nget the site off whatever blacklist it's managed to get on!  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\ngasparnagy commented Apr 15, 2024\n\n@mooragor thx for your help so far. It seems that the on the same server where\nour docs is hosted at read-the-docs, someone else published some malware, so\nthat IP address as added to blocklists. Now we need to convince them that this\nis a shared server, and our docs site is clear. For Malwarebytes you can\nreport such \"false positives\" at\nhttps://forums.malwarebytes.com/forum/123-website-blocking/ (unfortunately it\nrequires signup).Could you make a ping docs.reqnroll.net on your desktop to\nknow which IP address is used for the site at your location?  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nmooragor commented Apr 15, 2024\n\n    \n    \n    ping docs.reqnroll.net Pinging readthedocs.io [104.17.32.82] with 32 bytes of data: Reply from 104.17.32.82: bytes=32 time=19ms TTL=57  \n  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\ngasparnagy commented Apr 15, 2024\n\n@mooragor I see. For me it is 104.17.33.82. I wonder whether the block is only\nfor that IP or all the IP range used...If I may use your time a bit more:\ncould you please add a line\n\n    \n    \n    104.17.33.82 docs.reqnroll.net\n\nto your C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts file (you can edit it as admin\nwith notepad) temporarily and try to access the site again from a new browser\n(the best is if you use a different browser (e.g. edge instead of chrome) so\nthat it surely does not use a cached IP)?  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nmooragor commented Apr 15, 2024\n\nDoing that let the docs site load.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nmooragor commented Apr 15, 2024\n\nAlso, even after removing that from /etc/hosts again, the docs are still\nloading for me. Ping (new command window) is bringing back 104.17.33.82 as the\nIPaddress still.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nmooragor commented Apr 15, 2024\n\nOur IT team also report the same sort of 'it's been flagged as potentially\nmalicious' reason for Netscope blocking it.\"It appears those two subdomains\nfor Reqnroll have been flagged as having hosted malicious resources, or have\nbeen potentially compromised. Can you please share this with them, as that's\nwhy we cannot access them.\"  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\ngasparnagy commented Apr 15, 2024\n\nThx @mooragor!\n\n> Doing that let the docs site load.\n\nYeah. So it seems that the problem is not with the subdomain (as the IT team\nsaid), but the IP address, as I suspected, that we cannot really do anything\nwith, except change the hosting to somewhere else.\n\n> Also, even after removing that from /etc/hosts again, the docs are still\n> loading for me\n\nThat's just the browser caching the IP probably... :(\n\n> It appears those two subdomains for Reqnroll have been flagged as having\n> hosted malicious resources, or have been potentially compromised. Can you\n> please share this with them, as that's why we cannot access them.\n\nMaybe you can explain them the situation (it is a shared server) and report it\nas false positive helps... But this seems to be an endless fight...I think we\nshould really consider to host the docs site ourselves. It is a static site,\nso hosting is not a big deal (I did it for test as\ndocumentation.reqnroll.net), but the automatic update is complicated.If anyone\nhave a good idea what to do, please let me know.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nerlingbo commented Apr 18, 2024\n\nThe dns provider at my company blocks all traffic to any (sub)domain related\nto reqnroll.net, including www, docs and reqnroll.net itself. It is reported\nby checkpoint as a site \"known to contain malware\". Our IT department\nrecommends that you get in touch with checkpoint to remove this\nclassification.  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\ngasparnagy commented Apr 19, 2024\n\n@erlingbo thx. I will report it as false positive at Check Point\nThreatCloud... Grrrr.Feels like an endless fight...  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\ngasparnagy commented Apr 19, 2024 \u2022\n\nI have reported it. It was also misclassified by Webroot / OpenText, I\nreported there and it was cleared promptly.  \n---  \n  \nSign up for free to join this conversation on GitHub.
