Gitlin - 4/19/2024, 1:33 PM\n\nEnlarge / The Tesla Cybertruck.\n\nTesla\n\n#### reader comments\n\n131\n\nOn Monday, we learned that Tesla had suspended customer deliveries of its\nstainless steel-clad electric pickup truck. Now, the automaker has issued a\nrecall for all the Cybertrucks in customer hands\u2014nearly 4,000 of them\u2014in order\nto fix a problem with the accelerator pedal. It has come at an inconvenient\ntime for Tesla, which is laying off more than 10 percent of its workforce due\nto shrinking sales even as CEO Elon Musk asks for an extra $55.8 billion in\ncompensation.\n\nThe problem, which affects all 3,878 Cybertrucks delivered so far, has to do\nwith the EV's accelerator pedal. Tesla has fitted this with a metal-finish\ncover to match the brushed metal appearance of the truck itself\u2014no word on\nwhether the pedals rust, too\u2014but it says that at some point, \"an unapproved\nchange introduced lubricant (soap) to aid in the component assembly of the pad\nonto the accelerator pedal. Residual lubricant reduced the retention of the\npad to the pedal.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks to the profile of the Cybertruck's under dash, if the pedal cover\nbecomes partially detached it can slide up and become trapped in place,\nwedging the pedal down and unleashing all of the Cybertruck's substantial\npower\u2014the dual-motor truck boasts 600 hp (447 kW) and can reach 60 mph (98\nkm/h) in just over four seconds.\n\n  * This cover became partially detached from the accelerator pedal.\n\nTikTok/@el.chepito1985\n\n  * And then became stuck underneath some trim, jamming the accelerator on full.\n\nTikTok/@el.chepito1985\n\nPrevious SlideNext Slide\n\nFortunately, applying the brake overrides the accelerator and cuts torque\nimmediately, but that still didn't prevent one owner from allegedly crashing\ninto a light pole before he was able to bring his Cybertruck to a stop.\n\nTesla is no stranger to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's\nofficial recall process, but this time there is no software fix or over-the-\nair patch. Instead, the trucks will need to be physically inspected and\nreworked if necessary. The company says that it will notify its stores and\nservice centers about the recall \"on or around\" today, and that owners will be\ncontacted in due course.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n131\n\nJonathan M.

Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
