Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# TSMC to charge premium for making chips outside of Taiwan, including its new\nUS fabs, CEO says\n\nNews\n\nBy Anton Shilov\n\npublished 20 hours ago\n\nDue to higher costs of power, labor, and materials.\n\n(Image credit: TSMC)\n\nIn the recent years, TSMC has radically changed its strategy of making chips\nonly in Taiwan and initiated expansion overseas. As a result, the company is\nnow building up fabs in Germany, Japan, and the U.S. However, the world's top\ncontract chip will charge its customers a premium if they want their chips to\nbe made outside of Taiwan.\n\n\"If my customer requests to be in some certain area, then definitely, TSMC and\nthe customer had to share the incremental cost,\" said C.C. Wei, chief\nexecutive of TSMC, at the earnings call with analysts and investors (via\nSeekingAlpha). \"We do encounter some kind of higher cost in the overseas or\neven recently, the inflation and the electricity. We expect our customers to\nshare some of the higher cost with us, and we already started our discussion\nwith our customers.\"\n\nIndeed, the costs of building fabs in Germany, Japan, and the U.S. are higher\nthan the costs of building fabs in Taiwan and TSMC has complained about it a\nnumber of times in the past. The company even had to delay production start at\nits Fab 21 near Phoenix, Arizona, due to problems with tools installation and\nnegotiations with trade unions.\n\nTherefore, if a TSMC customer wants to produce its chips at a specific\nlocation, then the foundry will charge a premium. How high is that premium\nwill be remains to be seen, but last year a media report indicated that chips\nmade in Arizona on TSMC's N5 and N4 production nodes could be from 20% to 30%\nmore expensive than the same chips produced in Taiwan.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nDue to higher construction and operational expenses of fabs in Japan, Germany,\nand the U.S., TSMC plans to transfer these additional costs to its customers\nto sustain its target gross margin of 53%. Although American chip designers\nmay not welcome the increased production costs in the U.S., they will probably\nmanufacture chips intended for government and other markets less sensitive to\nprice increases at the Arizona facility. Consequently, they should manage to\npass on these higher costs to at least some of their end customers without\njeopardizing their market competitiveness.\n\n\"In today's fragmented globalization environment, cost will be higher for\neveryone, including TSMC, our customers, our competitors and the entire\nsemiconductor industry,\" the head of TSMC said. \"We plan to manage and\nminimize the overseas cost gap by, first, pricing strategically to reflect the\nvalue of geographic flexibility; second, working closely with government to\nsecure their support; and third, leveraging our fundamental advantage of\nmanufacturing technology leadership, and our large-scale manufacturing base,\nwhich no other manufacturer in this industry can match.\"\n\nIt is noteworthy that C.C. Wei's phrasing implies that if a customer does not\nrequest a specific manufacturing location, then TSMC will not charge its\n'location' premium. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether TSMC's yields in\nTaiwan, Germany, Japan, and the U.S. will be similar.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

Intel\nhad a situation in Arizona I recall where to get tax breaks on a new fab\nbuilding the number of employees they needed to add was so low they'd met it\nbefore construction finished. Then they ended up not actually spinning up the\nfab in the new building (they undoubtedly have since).\n\nReply\n\n  * JamesJones44\n\n> thestryker said:\n>\n> Usually there are strings, but they may as well not exist in many cases.\n> Intel had a situation in Arizona I recall where to get tax breaks on a new\n> fab building the number of employees they needed to add was so low they'd\n> met it before construction finished.

They claim it will create 10k jobs, but in truth they might only\nemployee 500 while the 9500 come from sub contracted work to build the\nfacility, connect the infra, setup the office, etc. They don't actually\n\"create\" those jobs, but many times in these grants those are allowed to be\ncounted.\n\nReply\n\n  * Co BIY\n\nMakes sense. USA made for security reasons is like any other special\nrequirement that one could expect to pay extra for.\n\nOTOH, They will probably also charge a premium for Taiwan produced products if\nthe market conditions are favorable.\n\nReply\n\n  * Alvar \"Miles\" Udell\n\nIt's not surprising, higher cost of production means higher cost of goods\nproduced. The question, however, is what the impact will be on the total cost\nof that good. It may cost more to have it made in the USA, Germany, or Japan\nthan in Taiwan, but if shipping costs are lower, not to mention being able to\navoid busy shipping ports and potential disruptions, not to mention\nmanufacturing lead time, then the total cost could easily be lower. AMD and\nnVidia will no doubt keep Taiwan as their base for GPUs as they are closer to\ntheir manufacturing plants and will perhaps venture out to Japan if Taiwan is\nbusy. Automotive, aviation, and other companies which manufacture goods in the\nUSA, EU, and Japan, however, may easily come out better sourcing their chips\nlocally.\n\nWe will also have to wait and see if Samsung, Texas Instruments, and Intel\nadopt the same policies.\n\nReply\n\n  * usertests\n\n> ohio_buckeye said:\n>\n> Instead of funding these folks why aren\u2019t we putting more money into\n> companies like Intel Samsung and amd?\n\nFlailing Intel is getting a lot of U.S. government money, some of which is\nbeing spent on TSMC chiplets.\n\nReply\n\n  * Starfal\n\nFun times are coming. Stuff are already sky-high. I can't imagine things\ngetting that much worse.\n\nReply\n\n  * sivaseemakurthi\n\nLooks like US govt has to subsidize chip manufacturing forever, this will be a\nlosing battle!\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nASML ships its second High-NA EUV litho tool to unspecified client\n\nUS sanctions transform China into legacy chip production juggernaut \u2014\nproduction jumped 40% in Q1 2024\n\nAlleged cryptojacker arrested for money laundering, $3.5 million in cloud\nservice fraud \u2014 ultimately mined less than $1 million in crypto\n\nDetermined modder gets 'Halo 2' running at 720p on the original Xbox \u2014 after\ntweaks to the console hardware, kernel, and game\n\nChinese researchers use low-cost Nvidia chip for hypersonic weapon\n\u2014unrestricted Nvidia Jetson TX2i powers guidance system\n\nChatGPT can craft attacks based on chip vulnerabilities \u2014 GPT-4 model tested\nby UIUC computer scientists\n\nASRock reveals two new 27-inch 1440p IPS monitors, one with an integrated Wi-\nFi antenna in the stand\n\nPlayStation overlay is coming to PC alongside 'Ghost of Tsushima' port\n\nSamsung unveils 10.7Gbps LPDDR5X mobile memory optimized for AI applications\n\nASML sets density record with latest chipmaking tools \u2014 High-NA EUV equipment\nprints first patterns\n\nHigh-end AMD RDNA 2 supply is dwindling \u2014 RX 6950 XT, RX 6900 XT, RX 6800 XT\nvirtually out of stock\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
