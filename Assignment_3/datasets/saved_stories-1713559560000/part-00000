Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes.

Roughly 50 reputed or confirmed skin-bound books are known to\nexist in libraries or private collections around the world. Credit...Jeenah\nMoon for The New York Times\n\nBy Jennifer Schuessler and Julia Jacobs\n\nApril 19, 2024, 5:02 a.m. ET\n\nThe New York International Antiquarian Book Fair is the place to inspect some\nof the most exquisite rare books on the market. But at this year\u2019s event in\nearly April, some browsers may have been unprepared for a small, grayish item\non view: a book bound in human skin.\n\nThe book, which measures about 3 by 5 inches, came with a price tag of $45,000\n\u2014 and a colorful back story. According to a statement by its owner, the\nbinding was commissioned in 1682 by an Italian doctor and anatomist identified\nas Jacopo X, and has been kept by his descendants ever since.\n\nFamily lore held that during a dissection, Jacopo recognized the woman on the\nslab as an actress he had seen in Corneille\u2019s comedy \u201cLe Baron d\u2019Albikrac.\u201d He\nknew that unclaimed bodies sold to medical schools for dissection were rarely,\nif ever, given a proper burial. So he removed a piece of skin, and used it to\nbind a copy of the play.\n\n\u201cThere was a sense that this was a tribute,\u201d Ian Kahn, a dealer, explained to\nonlookers gathered at the counter of his booth before pulling out the book to\noffer a closer look.\n\nBooks bound in human skin \u2014 and the sometimes sensational stories surrounding\nthem \u2014 have long occupied an odd place in the annals of the rare book world.\nOver the years, they have been whispered, bragged and joked about.\n\nBut over the past decade, the conversation has shifted. Many institutions\nwhose collections include these books have sharply restricted access, as they\nhave found themselves unexpectedly embroiled in the same debates about\ndisplaying \u2014 or even owning \u2014 human remains that have swept across museums.\n\nThe conversation was jolted anew last month when Harvard University announced\nthat it had removed the skin binding from a notorious book in its collections,\nand that it would be seeking \u201ca final, respectful disposition.\u201d The university\nalso apologized for \u201cpast failures in its stewardship,\u201d which it said had\n\u201cfurther objectified and compromised the dignity of the human being whose\nremains were used\u201d for the binding.\n\nImage\n\nThe volume bound in human skin was offered by the bookseller Ian Kahn, right,\nof the firm Lux Mentis.Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York Times\n\nThe announcement drew headlines around the world. But so far, the reaction\nfrom rare book experts has been muted \u2014 and mixed.\n\n\u201cIt was a bold move to put out a press release not just about the presence of\nhuman skin books, but about a potentially controversial way of dealing with\nthe issue,\u201d said Allie Alvis, a curator at the Winterthur Museum, Garden &\nLibrary in Delaware. Too many institutions, Alvis says, are unwilling to say\nmuch about them at all.\n\nBut others are troubled by what they see as the destruction of a historical\nartifact, and the imposition of 21st-century sensibilities onto objects from\ndifferent times and contexts.\n\nMegan Rosenbloom, a former medical librarian and the author of \u201cDark\nArchives,\u201d a study of the history and science of anthropodermic (or skin-\nbound) books, said that destroying or disposing of these objects would close\noff future scholarship and fresh understandings.\n\n\u201cWe should treat these books as respectfully as possible, but try not to bury\nliterally and figuratively what happened to these people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s\nhubris to think we\u2019ve come to the end of our evolution of how we think about\nhuman remains.\u201d\n\nAnd moves like Harvard\u2019s, Rosenbloom added, could backfire.\n\n\u201cIf all anthropodermic books are taken out of institutions,\u201d she said, \u201cthe\nrest of these books on the private market will probably go further\nunderground, where they might be treated less respectfully.\u201d\n\n## Rumors and Innuendo\n\nClaims of books bound in human skin have circulated for centuries. But the\nability to confirm them scientifically \u2014 using a technique called peptide mass\nfingerprinting \u2014 is only about a decade old.\n\nIn 2015, Rosenbloom and others started the Anthropodermic Book Project, with\nthe goal of uncovering \u201cthe historical truths behind the innuendo.\u201d So far,\nthe project has identified 51 purported examples worldwide, 18 of which have\nbeen confirmed as bound in human skin. Another 14 have been debunked.\n\nAn unknown number of others sit in private libraries. Kahn, whose firm, Lux\nMentis, handles a lot of \u201cchallenging material,\u201d as he put it, said he knows\nof several collectors in Paris who have skin-bound books.\n\nThe oldest reputed examples are three 13th-century Bibles held at the\nBiblioth\u00e8que Nationale in France. The largest number date from the Victorian\nera, the heyday of anatomical collecting, when doctors sometimes had medical\ntreatises and other texts bound in skin from patients or cadavers.\n\nImage\n\nA display at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh includes a small\nnotebook purportedly bound in the skin of William Burke, part of a duo of\nnotorious serial killers who sold their victims\u2019 bodies for\ndissection.Credit...Surgeons Hall Museums, The Royal College of Surgeons of\nEdinburgh\n\nOther examples relate to criminals or prisoners. At the Royal College of\nSurgeons of Edinburgh in Scotland, a display about the 19th-century growth of\nthe medical profession includes a small notebook purportedly bound in the skin\nof William Burke, part of a duo of notorious serial killers who sold their\nvictims\u2019 bodies for dissection. The Boston Athenaeum owns one bound in the\nskin of a man who, before he died in prison, had asked that two copies of his\nmemoir and deathbed confession be bound in his skin.\n\nWhile most known skin bindings are from Europe or North America, some involve\nwild claims, like a book at the Newberry Library in Chicago said to have been\n\u201cfound in the palace of the King of Delhi\u201d during the 1857 mutiny against\nBritish rule. (Lab examination, according to the library, concluded it was\nactually \u201chighly burnished goat.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s often a sense of othering of these books,\u201d said Alvis, the curator of\nWinterthur Museum, who posts about rare books on social media as\n@book_historia. \u201cThey don\u2019t come from the noble white person, but this strange\nperson from foreign climes.\u201d\n\nCurrent testing cannot identify race or sex of the skin. But at least a half-\ndozen 19th-century examples involve skin purportedly taken from female\npatients or cadavers by male doctors, with several used to cover books about\nfemale biology or sexuality (like a treatise on virginity held at the Wellcome\nCollection in London).\n\nAnd a few examples, both rumored and confirmed, have racial connections that,\nwhatever the intentions behind the bindings, may play uncomfortably today.\n\nImage\n\nA small notebook from the late 18th century owned by the Wellcome Collection\nin London.

But a pocket-size notebook at the Wellcome Collection, long claimed to\nhave been bound in the skin of Crispus Attucks, a mixed-race Black and Native\nman recognized as the first person to die for American independence, is likely\nbound in camel, horse or goat skin, according to the museum.\n\n## A \u2018Violated Woman\u2019?\n\nThe volume at Harvard, an 1879 philosophical treatise called \u201cDes Destin\u00e9es de\nL\u2019Ame,\u201d or \u201cThe Destiny of Souls,\u201d was bound by a French doctor named Ludovic\nBouland, who inserted a note saying that \u201ca book about the human soul deserved\nto have a human covering.\u201d It was placed at Harvard\u2019s Houghton Library in 1934\nby John Stetson, an heir to the hat fortune, along with another note saying\nthat the skin came from a woman who died in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nAccording to Harvard, library lore holds that \u201cdecades ago\u201d the book was\nsometimes used to haze unsuspecting student workers. But questions about the\nlibrary\u2019s recent stewardship emerged in 2014, after the library published a\njokey blog post describing the confirmation of the skin binding as \u201cgood news\nfor cannibals.\u201d\n\nPaul Needham, a prominent rare book expert who retired from Princeton in 2020,\nwas deeply offended, and began calling on Harvard to remove the skin and give\nit a \u201crespectful burial.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that the way the Houghton Library treated this was a disservice to\nthe world of rare book collecting,\u201d he said.\n\nThe library imposed some restrictions on access in 2015. Winds shifted further\nin 2021, when Harvard formed a Steering Committee on Human Remains to examine\nall of its collections, as an outgrowth of its efforts to reckon with its\nhistoric entanglements with slavery.\n\nImage\n\nA view of the New York International Antiquarian Book Fair in April, where the\nbook bound in human skin was one of thousands of items offered by nearly 200\ndealers. Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York Times\n\nA single skin-bound book from 19th-century France may seem like a small thing\namid the more than 20,000 human remains in Harvard\u2019s collections, including\n6,500 from Native Americans, which critics say are not being researched and\nrepatriated quickly enough.\n\nBut to Needham, who was involved in starting an affinity group to pressure\nHarvard into burying the skin of what the group called \u201cthe violated woman\ntrapped in the binding,\u201d the moral imperative is clear: The proper disposition\nof human remains should take ethical precedence, particularly where the person\nhas not given consent.\n\n\u201cWhat 100 years from now would be the potential new research that would be\ndone?\u201d Needham said. \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine it.\u201d\n\nHarvard\u2019s decision is drawing heightened attention to skin-bound volumes\nelsewhere, including one at the Cleveland Public Library: an 1867 edition of\nthe Quran, acquired in 1941 from a dealer who had described it as \u201cformerly\nthe property of the East Arab chief Bushiri ibn Salim who revolted against the\nGermans in 1888.\u201d\n\nFor decades, the book typically received a handful of requests a year for\naccess, said John Skrtic, the library\u2019s chief of collections. But earlier this\nyear, the library made it off-limits, pending testing.\n\n\u201cThe library has long believed the undocumented claim in the dealer\u2019s catalog,\nregarding its binding, to be false and finds the claim sensationalistic and\ndeeply offensive,\u201d the Cleveland Public Library said in a statement. The\nlibrary will \u201cengage leaders in the local Muslim community to chart an ethical\npath forward.\u201d\n\nHarvard\u2019s approach is also generating strong criticism. Eric Holzenberg, a\nbook scholar who recently retired as director of the Grolier Club in\nManhattan, said that the destruction of the binding \u201caccomplishes nothing,\u201d\nbeyond expressing disapproval of \u201cthe acts of people long dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarvard, it seems to me, has taken the easy way out,\u201d Holzenberg said. \u201cNo\ndoubt the proper, cautious, committee-generated, risk-averse approach, but\nultimately I fear at the expense of sound scholarship and responsible\nstewardship.\u201d\n\nRosenbloom, the author of \u201cDark Archives,\u201d said she questioned the tendency to\npull these objects, which were generally not created or collected in a context\nof colonialism, into models developed to address those injustices. And she\nwondered why Harvard had removed the binding before finishing full provenance\nresearch.\n\nIn response to emailed questions, Thomas Hyry, the director of Houghton\nLibrary, and Anne-Marie Eze, its associate librarian, said they did not\nbelieve dismantling of the binding would limit future scholarship.\n\n\u201cThe decisions we have made to remove the human remains from our volume will\nnot erase what we know about this practice for those studying the history of\nthe book,\u201d they said.\n\n## Balancing Research and Respect\n\nSome libraries that have undertaken an ethical review of their anthropodermic\nbooks have reached different conclusions.\n\nBrown University\u2019s John Hay Library has four books confirmed as bound in human\nskin, including an edition of Vesalius\u2019s landmark 1543 anatomical atlas, \u201cOn\nthe Structure of the Human Body.\u201d In the past, they were promoted on campus\ntours and sometimes brought out for Halloween and other events.\n\nBut in 2019, the library\u2019s new director, Amanda Strauss, paused any showing of\nthe books, while developing policies that balanced respect for human remains\nwith the library\u2019s research mandate.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to censor access to controversial or disturbing material,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want to shame anyone for their interest.\u201d\n\nToday, images of the books\u2019 pages (but not the bindings) are available online,\nwhile access to the physical books is limited to people conducting research on\nmedical ethics or anthropodermic bindings.\n\nStrauss said she would be uncomfortable with any alteration or destruction of\nthe bindings, which she said amounted to \u201cerasure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t pretend this wasn\u2019t a practice and this didn\u2019t happen,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBecause it did, and we have the evidence.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe title page of an edition of Corneille\u2019s play \u201cLe Baron d\u2019Albikrac,\u201d bound\nin skin that a 17th-century doctor reputedly took from the cadaver of an\nactress he had seen in a production.Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York\nTimes\n\nWith any macabre object, the line between morbid curiosity and the pursuit of\nunderstanding may be hard to draw.\n\nKahn, the dealer, said he wanted to \u201cdemystify\u201d books bound in skin, which he\nsaid can prompt conversations about ethics, knowledge and our own status as\nanimals. At the book fair, many seemed open to those questions and curious,\nhowever queasily, to touch the Corneille volume.\n\nOne browser, Helen Lukievics, a retired lawyer, said she had read about the\nHarvard book and shuddered. But she was persuaded, she said, by the idea that\nthis particular binding had been meant as a \u201ctribute\u201d to the actress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fabulously appalling,\u201d she said. She paused. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece of history.\u201d\n\nJennifer Schuessler is a culture reporter covering intellectual life and the\nworld of ideas. She is based in New York.
