Saunders delivered this speech\nabout \u201cfailures of kindness\u201d as the commencement address to Syracuse\nUniversity\u2019s class of 2013.\n\nNote: Thanks to reader Harvey Freedenberg, who originally told me about this\nspeech.\n\n## Speech Transcript\n\nDown through the ages, a traditional form has evolved for this type of speech,\nwhich is: Some old fart, his best years behind him, who, over the course of\nhis life, has made a series of dreadful mistakes (that would be me), gives\nheartfelt advice to a group of shining, energetic young people, with all of\ntheir best years ahead of them (that would be you).\n\nAnd I intend to respect that tradition.\n\nNow, one useful thing you can do with an old person, in addition to borrowing\nmoney from them, or asking them to do one of their old-time \u201cdances,\u201d so you\ncan watch, while laughing, is ask: \u201cLooking back, what do you regret?\u201d And\nthey\u2019ll tell you. Sometimes, as you know, they\u2019ll tell you even if you haven\u2019t\nasked. Sometimes, even when you\u2019ve specifically requested they not tell you,\nthey\u2019ll tell you.\n\nSo: What do I regret? Being poor from time to time? Not really. Working\nterrible jobs, like \u201cknuckle-puller in a slaughterhouse?\u201d (And don\u2019t even ASK\nwhat that entails.) No. I don\u2019t regret that. Skinny-dipping in a river in\nSumatra, a little buzzed, and looking up and seeing like 300 monkeys sitting\non a pipeline, pooping down into the river, the river in which I was swimming,\nwith my mouth open, naked? And getting deathly ill afterwards, and staying\nsick for the next seven months? Not so much. Do I regret the occasional\nhumiliation? Like once, playing hockey in front of a big crowd, including this\ngirl I really liked, I somehow managed, while falling and emitting this weird\nwhooping noise, to score on my own goalie, while also sending my stick flying\ninto the crowd, nearly hitting that girl? No. I don\u2019t even regret that.\n\nBut here\u2019s something I do regret:\n\nIn seventh grade, this new kid joined our class. In the interest of\nconfidentiality, her Convocation Speech name will be \u201cELLEN.\u201d ELLEN was small,\nshy. She wore these blue cat\u2019s-eye glasses that, at the time, only old ladies\nwore. When nervous, which was pretty much always, she had a habit of taking a\nstrand of hair into her mouth and chewing on it.\n\nSo she came to our school and our neighborhood, and was mostly ignored,\noccasionally teased (\u201cYour hair taste good?\u201d \u2014 that sort of thing). I could\nsee this hurt her. I still remember the way she\u2019d look after such an insult:\neyes cast down, a little gut-kicked, as if, having just been reminded of her\nplace in things, she was trying, as much as possible, to disappear. After\nawhile she\u2019d drift away, hair-strand still in her mouth. At home, I imagined,\nafter school, her mother would say, you know: \u201cHow was your day, sweetie?\u201d and\nshe\u2019d say, \u201cOh, fine.\u201d And her mother would say, \u201cMaking any friends?\u201d and\nshe\u2019d go, \u201cSure, lots.\u201d\n\nSometimes I\u2019d see her hanging around alone in her front yard, as if afraid to\nleave it.\n\nAnd then \u2014 they moved. That was it. No tragedy, no big final hazing.\n\nOne day she was there, next day she wasn\u2019t.\n\nEnd of story.\n\nNow, why do I regret that? Why, forty-two years later, am I still thinking\nabout it? Relative to most of the other kids, I was actually pretty nice to\nher. I never said an unkind word to her. In fact, I sometimes even (mildly)\ndefended her.\n\nBut still. It bothers me.\n\nSo here\u2019s something I know to be true, although it\u2019s a little corny, and I\ndon\u2019t quite know what to do with it:\n\nWhat I regret most in my life are failures of kindness.\n\nThose moments when another human being was there, in front of me, suffering,\nand I responded . . . sensibly. Reservedly. Mildly.\n\nOr, to look at it from the other end of the telescope: Who, in your life, do\nyou remember most fondly, with the most undeniable feelings of warmth?\n\nThose who were kindest to you, I bet.\n\nIt\u2019s a little facile, maybe, and certainly hard to implement, but I\u2019d say, as\na goal in life, you could do worse than: Try to be kinder.\n\nNow, the million-dollar question: What\u2019s our problem? Why aren\u2019t we kinder?\n\nHere\u2019s what I think:\n\nEach of us is born with a series of built-in confusions that are probably\nsomehow Darwinian. These are: (1) we\u2019re central to the universe (that is, our\npersonal story is the main and most interesting story, the only story,\nreally); (2) we\u2019re separate from the universe (there\u2019s US and then, out there,\nall that other junk \u2013 dogs and swing-sets, and the State of Nebraska and low-\nhanging clouds and, you know, other people), and (3) we\u2019re permanent (death is\nreal, o.k., sure \u2013 for you, but not for me).\n\nNow, we don\u2019t really believe these things \u2013 intellectually we know better \u2013\nbut we believe them viscerally, and live by them, and they cause us to\nprioritize our own needs over the needs of others, even though what we really\nwant, in our hearts, is to be less selfish, more aware of what\u2019s actually\nhappening in the present moment, more open, and more loving.\n\nSo, the second million-dollar question: How might we DO this? How might we\nbecome more loving, more open, less selfish, more present, less delusional,\netc., etc?\n\nWell, yes, good question.\n\nUnfortunately, I only have three minutes left.\n\nSo let me just say this. There are ways. You already know that because, in\nyour life, there have been High Kindness periods and Low Kindness periods, and\nyou know what inclined you toward the former and away from the latter.\nEducation is good; immersing ourselves in a work of art: good; prayer is good;\nmeditation\u2019s good; a frank talk with a dear friend; establishing ourselves in\nsome kind of spiritual tradition \u2014 recognizing that there have been countless\nreally smart people before us who have asked these same questions and left\nbehind answers for us.\n\nBecause kindness, it turns out, is hard \u2014 it starts out all rainbows and puppy\ndogs, and expands to include . . . well, everything.\n\nOne thing in our favor: some of this \u201cbecoming kinder\u201d happens naturally, with\nage. It might be a simple matter of attrition: as we get older, we come to see\nhow useless it is to be selfish \u2014 how illogical, really. We come to love other\npeople and are thereby counter-instructed in our own centrality. We get our\nbutts kicked by real life, and people come to our defense, and help us, and we\nlearn that we\u2019re not separate, and don\u2019t want to be. We see people near and\ndear to us dropping away, and are gradually convinced that maybe we too will\ndrop away (someday, a long time from now). Most people, as they age, become\nless selfish and more loving. I think this is true. The great Syracuse poet,\nHayden Carruth, said, in a poem written near the end of his life, that he was\n\u201cmostly Love, now.\u201d\n\nAnd so, a prediction, and my heartfelt wish for you: as you get older, your\nself will diminish and you will grow in love. YOU will gradually be replaced\nby LOVE. If you have kids, that will be a huge moment in your process of self-\ndiminishment. You really won\u2019t care what happens to YOU, as long as they\nbenefit. That\u2019s one reason your parents are so proud and happy today. One of\ntheir fondest dreams has come true: you have accomplished something difficult\nand tangible that has enlarged you as a person and will make your life better,\nfrom here on in, forever.\n\nCongratulations, by the way.\n\nWhen young, we\u2019re anxious \u2014 understandably \u2014 to find out if we\u2019ve got what it\ntakes. Can we succeed? Can we build a viable life for ourselves? But you \u2014 in\nparticular you, of this generation \u2014 may have noticed a certain cyclical\nquality to ambition. You do well in high-school, in hopes of getting into a\ngood college, so you can do well in the good college, in the hopes of getting\na good job, so you can do well in the good job so you can . . .\n\nAnd this is actually O.K. If we\u2019re going to become kinder, that process has to\ninclude taking ourselves seriously \u2014 as doers, as accomplishers, as dreamers.\nWe have to do that, to be our best selves.\n\nStill, accomplishment is unreliable. \u201cSucceeding,\u201d whatever that might mean to\nyou, is hard, and the need to do so constantly renews itself (success is like\na mountain that keeps growing ahead of you as you hike it), and there\u2019s the\nvery real danger that \u201csucceeding\u201d will take up your whole life, while the big\nquestions go untended.\n\nSo, quick, end-of-speech advice: Since, according to me, your life is going to\nbe a gradual process of becoming kinder and more loving: Hurry up. Speed it\nalong. Start right now. There\u2019s a confusion in each of us, a sickness, really:\nselfishness. But there\u2019s also a cure. So be a good and proactive and even\nsomewhat desperate patient on your own behalf \u2014 seek out the most efficacious\nanti-selfishness medicines, energetically, for the rest of your life.\n\nDo all the other things, the ambitious things \u2014 travel, get rich, get famous,\ninnovate, lead, fall in love, make and lose fortunes, swim naked in wild\njungle rivers (after first having it tested for monkey poop) \u2013 but as you do,\nto the extent that you can, err in the direction of kindness. Do those things\nthat incline you toward the big questions, and avoid the things that would\nreduce you and make you trivial. That luminous part of you that exists beyond\npersonality \u2014 your soul, if you will \u2014 is as bright and shining as any that\nhas ever been. Bright as Shakespeare\u2019s, bright as Gandhi\u2019s, bright as Mother\nTeresa\u2019s. Clear away everything that keeps you separate from this secret\nluminous place. Believe it exists, come to know it better, nurture it, share\nits fruits tirelessly.\n\nAnd someday, in 80 years, when you\u2019re 100, and I\u2019m 134, and we\u2019re both so kind\nand loving we\u2019re nearly unbearable, drop me a line, let me know how your life\nhas been. I hope you will say: It has been so wonderful.\n\nFootnotes\n\n  1.
