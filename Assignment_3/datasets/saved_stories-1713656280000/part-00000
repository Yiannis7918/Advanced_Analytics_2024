It reproduces an exchange of\nemails I had with Bart Campolo about my memoir, Where the Light Fell. Bart,\nson of the Baptist speaker and writer Tony Campolo, grew up in the heart of\nthe evangelical subculture. He worked as an urban missionary and co-founded\nMission Year, a year-long program in which Christian young people live in\nurban neighborhoods and find practical ways to love their neighbors.\nUltimately, however, Bart declared himself an atheist and launched a new\ncareer as a \u201chumanist chaplain\u201d and podcaster. The book Why I Left, Why I\nStayed, co-written with his father, explains his loss of faith as a kind of\n\u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d over the course of more than thirty years. I\u2019ve\ncrossed paths with Bart several times, and recently sent him a copy of my\nmemoir with a note suggesting that he would likely find much in it to identify\nwith.\n\nBart:\n\nHappily, newly-diagnosed Adult ADHD be damned, I read your book in a jiffy!\n\nFirst of all, thank you for thinking of me that way. You were right, of\ncourse, about me identifying with some of your story, but honestly, given my\nimpressions of our few conversations, I was surprised by how little our\njourneys have in common. Indeed, one might fairly say we are polar opposites:\nYou\u2019ve worked out and kept faith in a good, loving and distinctively Christian\nGod in the face of a thousand and one life experiences suggesting no such\nperson exists, while I\u2019ve let go of that same story despite growing up with\nevery emotional, economic, and spiritual privilege imaginable and having more\nthan my share of moments when the Holy Spirit seemed to be whispering in my\near....\n\nLikewise, it isn\u2019t very hard for me to understand and perhaps even admire your\nongoing commitment to the best kind of Christianity. What I still don\u2019t\nunderstand, however, even after reading your book, is why exactly you first\nchose towards the end of Bible College to undertake what anthropologist T. M.\nLuhrmann calls \u201cthe incredibly hard work required to make God real.\u201d As far as\nI know, all you\u2019d seen to that point was craziness, legalism, and the human\nfingerprints on every page of the Bible and its myriad interpretations. You\ndon\u2019t mention the influence of a compellingly loving mentor or a charismatic\nband of brothers who drew you in. Was it [your wife] Janet, somehow, that\nmotivated you?\n\nPlease don\u2019t get me wrong, Philip. I\u2019m not suggesting that the Jesus you met\nas the Good Samaritan in that little prayer room wasn\u2019t genuinely present to\nyou. Rather, I\u2019m wondering why, after all the terrible, ichthus-branded\nnonsense you\u2019d endured to that point, you kept seeking out that experience, or\neven stayed open to it, even though you\u2019d not yet seen any indication that\nChristianity was a sane or reliable pathway to love and happiness. In other\nwords, I\u2019m wondering why you cooperated with a worldview that hitherto had\nonly let you down?\n\nPhilip: What a great letter\u2014one of my favorite responses to my memoir. My\ninitial goal in writing was to try to capture the subculture in the same way\nothers have captured the Orthodox Jewish subculture (Chaim Potok) and the\nIrish Catholic one (Frank McCourt). I sought to tell my story as truthfully as\nI could, without a hidden agenda or evangelical cover-up, and only a hint of a\nbridge between the person of my youth and the person I am now. I figure the 25\nother books I\u2019ve written, all idea-driven, speak for who I am as an adult....\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard dozens of dramatic conversion stories, in which one\ntranscendent event changes everything for a prisoner, an addict, an Oxford don\nlike C.S. Lewis, or a proud jerk like Chuck Colson. And similar accounts can\nbe found in the Nation of Islam, Jehovah\u2019s Witness, Marxism, and any other\nreligion or quasi-religion. (As you know, there are conversions away from\nfaith as well.) You ask how that one event could somehow overcome the toxic\nfaith I grew up with and in. Well, that\u2019s where the other 25 books come in.\n\nI can envision an ironic God saying, \u201cPhilip, you\u2019ve seen some of the worst of\nthe church\u2014let me show you some of the best.\u201d While writing my first book,\nWhere Is God When It Hurts?, I encountered Dr. Paul Brand, the closest thing\nto a saint I\u2019ve met. He had the humble faith of a Mother Teresa, as well as a\ncommitment to the lowliest people on earth, leprosy patients among the lowest\ncastes of India. Unlike Mother Teresa, he was a modern scientist with\nlaboratories full of engineers and computers.\n\nWe collaborated together for almost 10 years, at a time when my faith was just\nbeginning to take shape, a kind of cocoon phase. He became a surrogate father\nto me. At his funeral I mentioned the exchange we had: I gave words to his\nfaith while he gave faith to my words. Dr. Brand showed me, up close and in\nperson, what I believe God had in mind with the human experiment.\n\nUntil the memoir, I rarely looked back on the mess of my childhood. I had\nmoved away from the South, first to Chicago, where I finally found a healthy\nchurch that combined justice and grace, and then to Colorado, where I reveled\nin the beauties of nature, one of the places \u201cwhere the light fell\u201d for me.\nTentatively at first, I started picking up the pieces of my faith, like\nsmudged rocks, and in my books began cleaning them off, deciding what should\nstay and what should be discarded. We didn\u2019t know the word \u201cdeconstructing\u201d\nback then, but I suppose that\u2019s what I was doing. My second solo book was\nDisappointment with God, and later many of my books asked questions\u2014my\nquestions: Prayer: Does It Make Any Difference?, What\u2019s So Amazing About\nGrace?, Church: Why Bother? and the implicit question in The Jesus I Never\nKnew. I tried to be honest in these books, picking up the pieces, sorting out\nwhat to keep and what to discard.\n\nI greatly respect the path you\u2019ve chosen, Bart, because I know of your devout\nand activist past and can only imagine the pressures you faced when you struck\nout in a different direction from your upbringing. My brother lived out a\nsimilar trajectory, and still does, and I honor that in my memoir. I love the\nbook you did with your dad, and the pacific tone you both demonstrated.\n\nOh, do I know the craziness you speak of. However, I\u2019ve managed to avoid most\nof it in my adult years. Indeed, in my travels to some 87 countries I\ndeliberately seek Christians who act out their beliefs with compassion and\nselfless love. The finest people I know are Christians who have done great\nthings: Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu, Gary Haugen of the International\nJustice Mission, Bryan Stevenson of the Equal Justice Initiative, not to\nmention many others who serve on the front lines of human suffering. In my\nwritings, I try to highlight those who act on what Jesus called for in his\nfirst sermon (Luke 4) and his last (Matthew 25). You don\u2019t have to be a Jesus\nfollower to take up those causes, of course, but I\u2019ve been privileged to shine\na light on those who are. My book Soul Survivor profiles the ones who became\nmy mentors.\n\nI can\u2019t take credit for how my career has developed. So much of it happened\nthrough serendipity or grace, depending on one\u2019s perspective. For whatever\nreason, I\u2019ve been able to look forward rather than backward most of the\ntime\u2014until Where the Light Fell. To my surprise, writing about those painful\ndays didn\u2019t cause much \u201cphantom limb\u201d pain. I view my past through a\nredemptive lens, and feel liberated from the shackles of fundamentalism. At\nthe same time, I see the damage in those whose faith doesn\u2019t survive, such as\nmy brother, and easily understand why so many choose the path of rejection.\n\nAt the core, we\u2019re both \u201cbridge people,\u201d I think. We start from opposite banks\nof the river, and perhaps we\u2019ll never meet in the middle. But we understand\nthat, and still share the goal of finding a way across. Make sense?\n\nBart: You already know I think you\u2019re the cat\u2019s pajamas, so I\u2019m cutting right\nto the chase: You still haven\u2019t answered my question.\n\nI haven\u2019t read most of those 25 other books, but I\u2019m pretty sure I understand\nhow you overcame the toxic Christianity you grew up in after your dramatic\nconversion. Certainly Dr. Brand, a healthy church, the Rocky Mountains, Tutu,\nGary Haugen, and Bryan Stevenson (you can\u2019t have Mandela; he falls on my side)\nwould all be great mentors in opposite-of-toxic Christianity, and like me,\nyou\u2019re naturally gifted at the kind of theological gymnastics necessary to\nwrap that kind of goodness around a fairly bloody atonement story.\n\nWhat I\u2019m still wondering about is your conversion itself, or to be more\nspecific, what caused you to open yourself to that transcendent event before\nyou met all those good people and had all those good experiences and worked\nout all those work-arounds to useless suffering and unanswered prayers. What\nmade you so desperate to become a Christian when you\u2019d not yet met one you\ncould fully identify with? Why were you praying with those fellows in the\nfirst place when, at that point at least, you knew better?\n\nWe are indeed both bridge people, I think, but I suspect that most of the\nbridges we\u2019re building are about helping people move from less hopeful and\nloving versions to more hopeful and loving versions of whatever worldview\nthey\u2019re stuck with.\n\nPhilip: It took me a while to read your email, because I got distracted\nsearching online for the origin of cat\u2019s pajamas. What a strange phrase.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to answer your question in a way that might make sense. The\nconversion story happened at a time when I relished being a cynical renegade.\nI attended the weekly prayer meeting only because it was required and I would\nhave flunked the graded assignment if I didn\u2019t. I had never initiated a\nprayer, and have no idea why I did then, other than perhaps to get in the lick\nthat \u201cI don\u2019t care about all those people going to hell.\u201d And the vision or\nepiphany or whatever one might call it took me completely off guard. I left\nthe room unsettled and disturbed.\n\nOn reflection, the school had a regular parade of folks who did good\nmissionary work in medicine, justice issues, poverty work\u2014much like the ones\nyou encountered in Mission Year. And I had read a bit of C.S. Lewis,\nChesterton, W. H. Auden and others, enough to convince me there must be some\nreasonable Christians out there, though I\u2019d not really met one. So I hadn\u2019t\noutright dismissed the possibility of some Christian truth.\n\nWhat else can I say? The power of that experience came from the fact that it\nfelt like something that happened to me rather than one more expression of\nfake spirituality, which I had long forsaken. I was not desperate to become a\nChristian\u2014indeed, almost the opposite, hence my sheepish response.\n\nGood questions, Bart. I think I worded things pretty carefully in the scene in\nmy memoir, trying to say no more and no less than I can vouch for. But, as I\nsay, conversions only make sense from the inside out (like conspiracy\ntheories?).\n\nHey, here\u2019s an idea. Would you be open to me running some of our dialogue in a\nblog, much as you did in the book with your dad? I\u2019m always looking for ways\nto help people relate to those who see the world differently, in a healthy and\nrespectful way. I wouldn\u2019t add commentary, and I\u2019d run everything by you in\nadvance. Think about it.\n\nBart: Ahhh...I very much appreciate these details! In very different ways,\nboth your prior exposure to good and reasonable (or, to my mind, less\nunreasonable) Christian voices and your impulsive, somewhat defiant first\nprayer in the presence of that handful of sincere believers give me a clearer\npicture of the powerful moments that followed. Obviously, I\u2019m bound to see\nthat picture differently than you do, but I\u2019ve seen [the movie] Rashomon\nenough times to know that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t both be right.\n\nEven so, you of all people should know better than to say conversions only\nmake sense from the inside out, since you\u2019ve surely seen more than your share\nof them carefully engineered by skillful, charismatic folks like Marjoe\nGortner, the Honorable Elijah Mohammed, Carmen (remember him?), my father and\nme, with assists from various musicians, lighting coordinators, and youth\nretreat cooks.\n\nOf course you can edit this dialogue for your blog, and add commentary as well\nif you\u2019d like. I trust you and I know from these past ten years how valuable\nit is for people to see everyday examples of that too-scarce commodity I call\n\u201cworldview humility.\u201d\n\nPhilip: Thanks for your trust, Bart. I see that you turn 60 this year. May\nyour remaining years be characterized by the same fierce search for truth and\ndemonstration of compassion that have always defined you. And, by the way, I\u2019m\nhappy to learn that the work of Mission Year continues, under the good\nauspices of The Simple Way, led by Shane Claiborne.\n\nI\u2019ll close with a paragraph from What\u2019s So Amazing About Grace?, a book I\nwrote two decades before I got around to writing my memoir:\n\nGrace comes free of charge to people who do not deserve it and I am one of\nthose people. I think back to who I was\u2014resentful, wound tight with anger, a\nsingle hardened link in a long chain of ungrace learned from family and\nchurch. Now I am trying in my own small way to pipe the tune of grace. I do so\nbecause I know, more surely than I know anything, that any pang of healing or\nforgiveness or goodness I have ever felt comes solely from the grace of God. I\nyearn for the church to become a nourishing culture of that grace.\n\nSubscribe to Philip Yancey\u2019s blog: https://bit.ly/PhilipYanceyBlog\n\n### Share this\n\n### 77 responses to \u201cFaith, Deconstructed or Reconstructed\u201d\n\n  1. Kristin says:\n\nSeptember 7, 2023 at 12:50 pm\n\nJust read this after hearing your conversation with Bart on his podcast\u2014I\u2019ve\nbeen wrestling with faith and suffering for 13 years, since my 39 year old\nhusband was diagnosed with ALS, and his health has deteriorated. He\u2019s\nparalyzed and on breathing support. I read your 3 questions book and\nDisappointment with God book as I struggled to hold onto faith more than a\ndecade ago. I underlined from DWG \u201cIf I ever wonder about the appropriate\n\u2018spiritual\u2019 response to pain and suffering. I can note how Jesus responded to\nhis own: with fear and trembling, with loud cries and tears.\u201d In 2017, I wrote\nin the margin \u201cThis is why I can\u2019t quite give up on faith.\u201d But as the disease\nprogressed during the years that followed, and I grew weary, and felt\nincreasingly isolated from community, and didn\u2019t feel the comfort of God in\nthe midst of our suffering, my faith unraveled and now I\u2019m at the point where\nI just don\u2019t know\u2013and if there is a God, then I guess this is where I\u2019m\nsupposed to be?\u2013because otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t the God who met you and gave\nyou a conversion experience, also meet me in my pain? It seems to be all about\nexperience at a certain point. You got a God-moment. Your brother didn\u2019t. Beth\nMoore also has a faith memoir where she wrote about an experience of God which\nkept her in even though she was living with some religious craziness. I\nenjoyed listening to your memoir and was struck with the thought that your\nbrother\u2019s response to his upbringing seemed more reasonable than yours. Why\nsome people get faith in the first place and why some people feel comfort in\nsuffering/wrestling with theodicy, seems to be quite out of our control,\ndoesn\u2019t it?\n\nReply\n\n  2.

I suppose I\nhave read all of your books but \u201cWhat\u2019s So Amazing About Grace\u201d remains my\npersonal favorite, and one that I have recommended to many friends and\nacquaintances. This communication with Bart Campolo was an amazing display of\ngrace and manners on the part of you both. (Does anybody remember manners?\nSeems almost quaint these days). I\u2019m curious as to whether or not you have had\nany communication with Bart Ehrman. Thanks for your continued help in my walk\nwith Jesus.\n\nReply\n\n     * Philip Yancey says:\n\nMarch 3, 2023 at 4:07 pm\n\nEhrman and I have exchanged a few messages, but we\u2019ve never met.\n\nReply\n\n  3.

Barb says:\n\nFebruary 9, 2023 at 9:41 am\n\nThis is a question for Bart:\n\nHelp me understand why you hold yourself and your dad guilty of having\nmanipulated people into a Christian conversion, or more generally, into\nChristian belief.\n\nBlessings\n\nReply\n\n  5. Rob Lilwall says:\n\nFebruary 7, 2023 at 7:24 pm\n\nThanks so much Philip, I\u2019ve printed this out and tucked it inside \u201cwhere the\nlight fell\u201d as a little postscript!\n\nEven more than when leaders lose their faith, I\u2019ve always found that when a\nfriend or acquaintance I know personally loses their faith, it really, really\nshakes me. Once or twice when I was younger it pushed me to the brink of\ngiving up myself.\n\nI know you have written on the issue of how/why you have kept your own faith\nin \u2018soul survivor\u2019, \u2018where the light fell\u2019, but I was wondering if you have\nwritten more explicitly about how you handle it when friends you respect lose\ntheirs (I\u2019ve read many of but not quite all of your books!).\n\nThank you so much.\n\nRob in Singapore\n\nReply\n\n     * Philip Yancey says:\n\nFebruary 7, 2023 at 8:47 pm\n\nNot yet. But I\u2019ll keep it in mind!\n\nReply\n\n  6. Ruby Neumann says:\n\nJanuary 31, 2023 at 7:09 am\n\nI discovered the link to this conversation from Bart\u2019s side. I am a supporter\nof Bart\u2019s podcast \u201cHumanize Me\u201d. He has helped me through the tumultuous\njourney of deconversion from a religious system, only to find that there are\npeople on both sides of the spiritual fence that want the same thing. Better\nLove for and in Humanity. I didn\u2019t make it through the 25 reads of PY... but I\nremember being impacted by \u201cThe Jesus I never Knew\u201d and \u201cGrace Notes\u201d. In\nfact, I was just at my Mom\u2019s this weekend and I snuck \u201cTJINK\u201d off her book\nshelf for maybe a reread. I want to remember what impacted me about that book.\nI read it in the heyday of my Pentecostal experience, and now I\u2019m wondering if\nI can look at it through these agnostic eyes and see something still\nimpacting. Jesus died last year for me and I thought it important to grieve\nthat loss. But as with all other human losses, I still want to keep a memory\nof what that person meant to me. How do I keep Jesus alive, like I keep my dad\nalive who has been dead for fifteen years now. That means something so very\ndifferent now? I don\u2019t want a religious icon. Those days are over. Maybe I\nwant to find something I can keep from a lifetime of embracing the story. I\nlistened to a podcast conversation yesterday and these words stuck out. \u201cGod\ndoesn\u2019t get everything in the divorce.\u201d That was recording artist Derek Webb.\nSomehow that is encouraging to me. Maybe I will even be able to read the bible\nagain... but as a story, not as an inerrant rule book. I used to love the\nstories.\n\nBridge building is something I am passionate about, but I don\u2019t know how to do\nmuch in my community other than love my people in their space and seek common\nground. I am up against a belief system that doesn\u2019t allow its adherents\noutside of their bubble, because of the fear of losing them to common sense or\nwisdom of any kind. I just want us to find a beauty in humanity and our\ndiversity in how we navigate this life. The exclusiveness message of\nChristianity is toxic and needs dying. Love embraces every one. Was that not\nevident in the life of Jesus? It seems that a lot of Christianity has\nforgotten it\u2019s leader.\n\nThank you PY for your conversation with BC. You both have been treasured\ninfluences in my journey and I am grateful that you connected.\n\nReply\n\n     * Philip Yancey says:\n\nFebruary 7, 2023 at 8:50 pm\n\nI love your spirit and believe you\u2019re already a bridge builder. Thank you for\nhaving an open mind and loving spirit.\n\nReply\n\n  7. Kam Congleton says:\n\nJanuary 30, 2023 at 12:06 pm\n\nPhilip, I love the photo of you smiling, in the midst of all those books\u2013 it\u2019s\nperfect. Like Michael Jordan with a basketball, that\u2019s you and words in ink.\nAnd what an interesting blog! ease say thank you to Bart for being real, along\nwith you.That\u2019s hard for all of us..Everyone wants the burden of proof to be\non the other side. I was wondering as I read the emails if you and Bart ever\ntalked about what lies behind our joint desire to see justice in the world?\nThe fact that the desire is there for all of us\u2013 atheist and believers both\u2013\npresents one of those bottom line WHY questions\u2013 I think for both believers\nand atheists . Because if there is no God, then where does our desire for\njustice and equality for the oppressed come from? If there\u2019s no God, wouldn\u2019t\nthe evolutionary principle of the \u201cstrong eating the weak\u201d feel \u201cnormal\u201d to\nus? Sadly, like the Nazi\u2019s proposed\u2013 should t the weak be culled out, for the\nsake of improving and strengthening humanity in the long run? And obviously\nthe idea of a just and good God, who permits evil and injustice, is a common\nquestion believers have to deal with ( and do, as your writings illustrate).\nJust wondering if Bart might agree to share how those with his worldview\nunderstand \u201cjustice\u201d if there is no God \u2013and thus no moral laws in the\nuniverse. Thanks so much, Philip. Kam\n\nReply\n\n  8. Robin Luethe says:\n\nJanuary 28, 2023 at 3:01 pm\n\n\u2018That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the\nworld.\u2019 A strangely worded verse, that light (explicity not Jesus) is\nundefined, but asserted to come from God, and enlightens everyone, Christian\nor not (?) (assuming that the word man was meant to be inclusive)\n\nThen there is the song \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019, which has only a word or two referring\nto any supernatural being, and never to Jesus by name, to the point that many\nunbelievers find it as their anthem of knowing grace and meaning in life.\n\nFinally, if one believes that this world/universe actually has meaning and\nthere is such a thing as goodness or pursuing that is a sort of supernatural\nbelief. We may have many more sisters and brothers in the faith than when we\nfirst believed.\n\nReply\n\n  9. Anthony Mercer says:\n\nJanuary 26, 2023 at 7:50 pm\n\nI am somewhat amazed at the restrained and gracious content of the\npreponderance of contributions on this matter. I am about to upset the lenient\ncharacter of the blog. Bart Campolo has unequivocally thrust the destruction\nof his erstwhile Christian faith in our faces but no one has had the temerity\nto upbraid him for his volte face from active evangelical Christian, pastor\nand missionary to becoming the energetic protagonist of atheistic humanism and\ncritic of all things Christian. Campolo summed up his mission today in a 2014\nmotivational speech in which he expounded on how to effectively persuade\nChristians and other religious people toward humanism : \u201cThe question that we\nneed to be asking is not, \u2018How do we prove that they\u2019re wrong?\u2019 but it\u2019s, \u2018How\ndo we offer people the same values that all people want, but how do we offer\nthose values, not supported by ancient myths or by supernatural fairy tales,\nbut how do we offer them love and goodness and purpose and mission, based on\nreason, based on common sense\u201d See Youtube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IDoNAWOC5g at 15.50 Reason and commonsense\nare now Campolo\u2019s guiding forces in his Humanist crusade. His rejection ofhis\nChristian faith is deeply saddening, worrying and potentially destructive . I\nwonder if a relevant portion of the New Testament has been brought to Bart\nCampolo\u2019s attention. It is in 2 Peter 2 20-22 20 If they have escaped the\ncorruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are\nagain entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than\nthey were at the beginning. 21 It would have been better for them not to have\nknown the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their\nbacks on the sacred command that was passed on to them. 22 Of them the\nproverbs are true: \u201cA dog returns to its vomit,\u201d and, \u201cA sow that is washed\nreturns to her wallowing in the mud.\u201d These are serious statements to\nponder,Philip.\n\nReply\n\n     * Philip Yancey says:\n\nJanuary 28, 2023 at 4:11 pm\n\nBart may have mellowed. I listened to one of his recent podcasts in which he\ninterviewed a singer who had a career in Christian music, followed Bart\u2019s path\naway from faith, and then re-converted. Bart gave him a platform and treated\nhim with great respect.\n\nReply\n\n  10.

Thanks for sharing this.\n\nReply\n\n  11. wayne coleR says:\n\nJanuary 25, 2023 at 3:54 pm\n\nAlmost 20 years ago J.B. Phillips wrote a book titled \u201cYour God is to Small\u201d.\nI think that for many that\u2019s their problem. They don\u2019t believe God still does\nmiracles. They question many things in the Bible which they will never\nunderstand because they are not God. They ponder over things like which star\ndid the wise men follows. Could not the God who made the universe will\nmillions of stars create just one more for a specific purpose and time. My God\ncan. I was 11 1/2 when Billy Graham preached the gospel in Brisbane,\nAustralia, in May 1959. From that point on I have trusted Jesus. Raised\nMethodist, it wasn\u2019t until some friends invited me to an Assembly of God\nChurch where I received the baptism of Holy Spirit. John 14:26 says, \u201cBut the\nCounselor, the Holy Spirit, . . . will teach you all things.\u201d John 16:13 tells\nus that The Holy Spirit will guide us into all truth. I\u2019m so grateful that He\nhas. My wife and I have been privileged to see many miracles take place. The\nblind have received their sight; the crippled have walked; and the barren\nwoman has given birth (to twins). Our God is a big God; He is able to do more\nthan we can think or imagine.\n\nReply\n\n  12.

Les H says:\n\nJanuary 25, 2023 at 5:40 am\n\nSUCH a needed dialogue. It seems this conversation is too dangerous for people\nto have within faith communities, so they take it private and shrivel their\nfaith away in the face of the damage that comes with retreat to dogmatic\nontologies. Love demands facing the real whole-heartedly, retreat is just\nthat...loss.\n\nThank you Bart and Philip.

Glad Kashung says:\n\nJanuary 25, 2023 at 3:45 am\n\nPhilip sir, What is faith? Do we force ourselves to believe something or does\nfaith come from conviction? Is trying to believe without understanding a\nfaith? Thank you.\n\nReply\n\n     * Philip Yancey says:\n\nJanuary 25, 2023 at 8:06 am\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all definition of faith. Hebrews chapter\n11 gives good insight. Faith does involve an intentional choice, one made\nwithout certainty (or it wouldn\u2019t be faith). Your phrase \u201ctrying to believe\nwithout understanding\u201d is not a bad place to start, because it shows\nintention, honesty, and humility.\n\nReply\n\n  15.

Kathy Samuels says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 6:21 pm\n\nIt\u2019s sad that the efforts of people in churches, thinking they are being\nChristian, have unknowingly damaged so many. I grew up in church, attended\nSunday School, and youth group regularly, but certainly didn\u2019t have a real\nrelationship with Jesus. It took a tragedy in my life at age 36 before I fell\non my face and finally submitted my life completely to Him. I said, \u201ctake all\nof me. I am yours.\u201d That was the turning point in my life. God had always been\nthere, but I had been avoiding Him at every turn in my life. I didn\u2019t want to\nknow Him. I didn\u2019t care to have Him involved in my life. I was too big a\nsinner. But when I finally reached the end of me, I took His hand. He lifted\nme up and wiped away my tears of regret and guilt. It\u2019s been so good to REALLY\nknow that I am not alone because He loves me. As Tozer said, \u201cfriendly eyes\nare looking back at me.\u201d The eyes of Jesus.\n\nThanks for sharing this.

Peter Olsson MD says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 5:05 pm\n\nI resonate with Steve Moran\u2019s two questions which have profound importance.\nThe anti-Christian tone in American academia has been powerful for many\ndecades and may have also influenced Bart as it has me. Freud and the\nFreudians in my psychoanalytic training years influenced me towards an\nincompetent atheism which has since faltered in face of God\u2019s grace in my\nlife. Steve\u2019s second point about what has become obvious dechurching and\ndechristianizing in America is a parallel process in influencing American\nyouth for many decades. I also wonder what influence Bart\u2019s ADHD has had on\nhis position in this fascinating conversation with .\n\nReply\n\n  22. John Nordquist says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 3:56 pm\n\nI thoroughly empathized with Brad. The process of leaving is long and often\npainful. For me, James Carse\u2019s, The Religious Case Against Belief is a seminal\nbook. When I first read it, I knew that what I believed didn\u2019t ring true.\nComing to understand that beliefs are inherently anthropogenic systems trying\nto explain the inexplicable was a tipping point for me. I find myself, at the\nbeginning of my ninth decade, having encountered the Mystery many call God. As\nthe circumference of what I know expands, so does the beginning of what I do\nnot. (This may be related to the post about spiral dynamics. I, too, will do\nsome research.) In reading the comments, I was struck by how connected\npeople\u2019s faith was to personal modeling, relationships, and the failings of\norganized religion, and not the truth of the Mystery. If, as Kant argued, the\nultimate nature of the universe is finally inaccessible to the rational mind,\nhow much more so is Mystery? So, I find myself having moved beyond religions\nbut not rejecting the Mystery.\n\nReply\n\n  23.

It is a\ngreat gift.\n\nWhy does God do what he does when he does and how he does?\n\nWhy was he silent the night I begged him through tears to speak or do\nsomething to encourage me?\n\nWhy did he choose to make such a dramatic appearance years later when I wasn\u2019t\nasking?\n\nPartly, I believe, because he wanted me to understand that he cannot be\nmanipulated. I wouldn\u2019t trade his choice of timing and manifestation for mine.\nHis was and is far beyond what I could have imagined.\n\nBe careful, Bart.

Patty says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 12:39 pm\n\nOur daughter \u201cworked hard\u201d to deconstruct her faith, with a therapist in her\nearly 30s. As I read Bart, his story reminds me of what the church became\nduring what has been dubbed \u201cA Cold Play concert, followed by a TED Talk.\u201d We\n\u201creconstructed\u201d our faith over many years. Philip\u2019s The Jesus I Never Knew\nplayed a great healing role during that time. Along with What\u2019s So Amazing\nabout Grace? We\u2019d left church, had been involved in ministry, and it\u2019s only\nrecently, after more than 6 years, we\u2019ve found ourselves joyfully back in a\nsmall community with like-minded believers. (No concerts, no TED talks, so\nrefreshing.) But \u201ccoming to Christ\u201d at 25 (I\u2019m now 67) for me wasn\u2019t about\nchurch; it was God intervening in my life, unmistakably. It was \u201cI have\neverything, goals met. What now?\u201d I did have a kind of Road to Damascus\nmoment. A place of fellowship came later. I always worried that our kids would\nnot truly experience personal faith, having been raised in it. Two have\ncontinued, one not so orthodox, but clearly knows. The third, the oldest, I\u2019d\ngiven the Jesus I Never Knew book to after my crisis of faith, in order to\nhelp open her eyes to faith outside of church. As a result \u201cshe sat with the\nsinners\u201d in college because she heard her Christian classmates judging them.\nShe\u2019s the one who deconstructed. She says she still believes in God, but\ndoesn\u2019t know what that means. Only God knows who is truly \u201csaved.\u201d Sounds like\nBart may still be on his own faith journey, as we believe our daughter is. We\ncan only pray and watch.\n\nReply\n\n  29.

I have read Disappointment With God numerous times over\nthe years, so obviously I have struggled with my faith off and on over the\ndecades. I believe I am involuntarily reconstructing my faith at the moment.\nBecause difficult life circumstances are making me see things differently, and\nnot just seeing blindly. If you get what I mean...\n\nI\u2019m having a crisis of faith, sort of. When something horrible is happening in\nthe life of a loved one (or my life), what in the world do I make of \u201cGod is\nmy refuge\u201d, \u201cGod will protect me\u201d, \u201cGod will keep me safe\u201d type of verses,\nmost of which are found in the Psalms and a few other OT books. Because God is\nnot literally protecting my mom or keeping her safe. These verses are\neverywhere and quoted often by daily devotionals, so I see and hear them\nalmost daily. Am I supposed to read all these many, many verses as hyperbole\nor allegory or are they meant for the Jewish people? Or is it talking about\nspiritual refuge? Or can I only receive comfort from these verses as they are\nreferring to safety/refuge only in heaven?\n\nI have been struggling with this for over a year. In my mind I finally settle\non \u201cembrace the mystery\u201d but sometimes that feels hollow. Thank you for any\ninsight you have.

Then he suggests that the\nHebrew Bible adds a fourth simple prayer:\n\n\u201cLamott\u2019s triad is hugely instructive.

Your book on Grace was a major\ncontribution to my Grace: A Workbook (Covenant Books). It is an \u201ceducational\u201d\nbook on Grace, but flows from my own journey to Grace.

Nathan McNally says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 10:06 am\n\nWell, this one got me to thinking.\n\nWhen I read this blog today my first thought was of the astounding figure of\nVietnam War vets who have committed suicide has exceeded the number killed in\ncombat (58,000 KIA). Then I wondered how many followers of Jesus have\ncommitted physical, emotional, intellectual, or spiritual suicide.\n\nI do not have a panacea. I would like to share a bit of my path.\n\nThis February will mark 47 years following Jesus. I am 72 years old. When I\nlook back on those years I could become discouraged. After my first tour in\nthe Army I came to Jesus by way of Campus Crusade at Kansas State. Back in the\nArmy. Got married (now in our 45th year). Baptism in the Holy Spirit. Called\nout of the Army. Attended and finished seminary. Prison ministry. Pastored a\nsmall church in Wyoming for 11 years (and despaired deeply). Worked in law\nenforcement (bivocational). Left pastoring. Worked in the oil business. Worked\nwith men God provided. Moved to Colorado. Continued to work with men.\nOstracized by the churches I attended from the time I left pastoring till now.\n\nChurch life is tough. Overall it reflects corporate life in the west. It is\nresults focused. (When was the last time you saw the main speaker at a\nconference leading a church of thirty?) So we pay the bills and do what it\ntakes to keep the lights on while folks hurt, struggle, and eventually leave\n(suicide?).\n\n13 years ago I began a different path. The search for life. I had to define it\nso I would know it when I saw it. First, I accepted that living makes me a\n\u201ctarget of opportunity\u201d. So be it. So began the Great Adventure into the\nreality of the Loving God and it continues. It has been fraught with failure,\ndead ends, and despair. It is the best time of my life. Daily I am practicing\nbeing loved by God and feebly loving Him back. Clearing away all the muck, it\nis the true foundation.\n\nSo what of this conversation? Here you can say a lot of stupid stuff. I will\ntry to avoid that trap. If I do not I apologize now. I would say to anyone on\nBart\u2019s path and to Bart the following.. Do not pound the nails into the coffin\nof a loving God. Step back, disengage, remove the source of wounding, and get\nhealed. Whatever time it takes is worth it.\n\nHow? Rediscover the foundation truth of a lovig God. Plant your feet there and\nbegin. Associate with at least one other person humbly yet magnificently\nimmersed in God\u2019s love. I realize it is much more complex and longer process\nthan I have stated here.\n\nThanks for the opportunity to share.\n\nNathan McNally\n\nReply\n\n  37. Ken Davis says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 9:56 am\n\nPhilip, This kind of interchange is so refreshing.

I\ncan\u2019t wait to see you in a few days and share that gift together. However, on\nthe golf course, the gloves come off and it\u2019s every man for himself.

I can\u2019t get past the feeling that atonement is something we\ninvented. Why? Perhaps to make us feel more important than a speck of cosmic\ndust in an infinite universe?\n\nI read the story of your childhood. Your circumstances were vastly different\neven though my parents were professional Christians. I didn\u2019t dabble in\nfundamentalism until I was a young man. I still remember how intoxicating it\nwas to think I right about everything, not realizing I was dog-paddling in a\ntoxic stew of exegetical nonsense. I eventually abandoned my evangelical\narrogance and began re-reading sermons by men like Harry Emerson Fosdick. I\nbecame an Episcopalian, mostly because they didn\u2019t define themselves by what\nthey opposed but welcomed everyone (as long as you didn\u2019t challenge their\ntraditions and the centrality of their \u201cfairly bloody atonement story\u201d).\n\nWhich brings me back to the atonement... Is it man-made or as natural as\ngravity? If it\u2019s something we humans invented then I think we need to revisit\nwhat Jesus is all about.

Eleanor Harrington says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 8:55 am\n\nI very much appreciated the dialogue between the two of you as one who was\nbrought up the way you both were, then went off into my own wilderness, so to\nspeak, and came back to a real faith in Jesus through his saving Grace.\n\nReply\n\n  41. Meredith Bunting says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 8:54 am\n\nAs I read this blogalogue, I kept interrupting, \u201c. Tell him,\u201d Phillip, \u201c Tell\nhim!\u201d It\u2019s Grace. The answer is grace. Until you\u2019ve been given it and know it,\nyou\u2019ll talk, argue, opine, and interrupt yourself, to make everything else the\npoint. The past, future, worldview, their view, war, peace, martyrdom,\nkingdom, you name it and you can\u2019t name it unless, like it was given you you,\nPhillip, it\u2019s Grace and it\u2019s God\u2019s gift of unmerited mercy. Tell him, Phil!\n\nReply\n\n  42. Kathryn Arnold says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 8:26 am\n\nThis made me read about Rashomon. The bottom line is not the relativism of\neach witness\u2019s testimony. The absolute is truth... there was a single hand\ndriving the weapon that killed the samurai.\n\nThe way I have experienced it, there is only one whose testimony is\nunimpeachable and Jesus is His incarnation. To believe otherwise would be to\nsay that truth does not exist.\n\nThe weapon did not drive itself.\n\nReply\n\n  43. Bob Myers says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 8:15 am\n\nI so respect and appreciate dialogues like this. Dialogues that seem to put\nhonesty above point scoring or trying to convince others. Ironically, I find\nthose the most convincing dialogues of all!\n\nI found \u201cWhen the Light Fell\u201d a book that was completely unsentimental and a\nbook that scrubs out triumphalism from my position as a committed Christian\nwho believes my faith is backed up with the ultimate non-negotiable facts and\ntruths that are so messy God Himself had to come down to save me. All the\nsystems and institutions together could not muster anything I could lean upon.\nOnly Jesus. That\u2019s how I read \u201cWhen the Light Fell\u201d. Somehow, only Jesus could\nsustain faith and beget faith after all that Phillip Yancey experienced. I\nloved the interchange about discovering people like Paul Brand and Bryan\nStephenson, who Jesus is the animating force for their benevolent work. I get\nthat heroes like Nelson Mandela may not have the single focus to trace their\nheroic acts to faith in Jesus Christ, but I think it\u2019s undeniable that\nMandela\u2019s inner circle knew of his ultimate faith, and of his request that his\nfuneral follow Methodist liturgy. He had to have been disillusioned by the\nracism that submerged so much of the \u201cchristianity\u2019 around him in South\nAfrica, but my understanding is that he refused to let the hypocrisy submerge\nthe irrepressible force of Jesus\u2019 life.\n\nReply\n\n     * Philip Yancey says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 9:42 am\n\nMandela attended three different mission schools. Those who were close to him\nsay that he had a strong faith but chose not to talk about it\u2013in part because\nof the racism in some of the white churches in S. Africa.\n\nReply\n\n  44. Ina Nelson Jones says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 8:13 am\n\nAs always your blog gives me something to ponder. My own questions and doubts\nhave made me feel \u201coutside\u201d the community of faith many times over the years.\nYour books have helped me with my own questions through the years. How\ngrateful I am for someone to voice what is often unspeakable in church! My\nchildren are all in different struggles for their faith, and I love and\nsupport them as best I can...mostly by giving them space. I did not know about\nBart and Tony\u2019s book. I look forward to reading it. Thank you Phillip. (I\nactually met you walking across the bridge in Montreat, N.C. a good many years\nago!)- Keep writing and speaking!!\n\nReply\n\n  45. Martha Davis says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 8:10 am\n\nPhillip, I truly believe that Grace is awakening in these days. I am one of\nthose angry , disillusioned Christians that found pure Grace waiting for me at\nthe end of myself. I read all of your books on that path, and they ultimately\nmade a difference. I\u2019m praying for Bart\u2019s return.\n\nReply\n\n  46. Bob Fryling says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 8:01 am\n\nPhilip, thanks for presenting this authentic dialog. It reminds me of a\nconversation I had just several weeks ago with a friend. I suspect it is also\nsimilar to the multitudes of spoken and unspoken conversations between\nevangelicals deconstructing their faith and those like you for whom \u201cthe light\nfell.\u201d We need such honest and public conversations for greater illumination\non this spiritual battle. Thank you!\n\nReply\n\n  47. Barbara Smith says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 7:48 am\n\nA helpful \u201cdialogue\u201d; thank you. All the exchanges remind me not to get so\nfull of myself \u2014 I saw Rashomon \u201360+years ago in black and white TV on\nplayhouse 90 I think \u2014 and understand the conundrum ( a little) unless there\nis One who sees all the ways we think things happen . . .\u201cLord, I believe;\nhelp my unbelief\u2019 is the best any of us can do really, but thank God it is\nenough.\u201d\u2015 Frederick Buechner, The Magnificent Defeat\n\nReply\n\n  48. David Pepper says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 7:43 am\n\nHi Philip, As i read the dialogue between Bart and yourself, like other\nreaders, I couldn\u2019t help but look at my past forty years as a believer in\nJesus Christ. My answer to Bart\u2019s primary question of faith is this: Jesus,\nthrough suffering and heartache, and sharing my own as well, created me to\nlove on me eternally and to ultimately fill me with His Glory forever. Who\nelse could ever offer and give such purpose and hope to one\u2019s life!! Blessings\nPhilip..David\n\nReply\n\n  49. Nila Haug says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 7:26 am\n\nI believe I am so fortunate to have been blessed with the parents I had. They\nwere the Lutneran Missouri Synod variety. I was not forced to be one. I was\nencouraged to be one with goals of perfect Sunday School attendance and was\nencouraged by my Dad to ask questions. I did. I had learned the Bible verse\nthat God says \u201ccome let us reason together.\u201d And the answers I was given did\nnot seem reasonable to me, so I kept asking and searching. I became a member\nof The Church of Christ. I then joined the Jehovah\u2019s Witness brand. By the\ngrace of God, I was disfellowshipped by both, ostracized by all my church\n\u201cfriends\u201d. I remained unchurched for 30 years. At age 81 I now fellowship with\nseveral varieties of believers. I feel fortunate that I did not have to endure\nthe anxieties and agonies that some people do. I think it was the fact that I\nwas encouraged to ask questions.\n\nReply\n\n  50. Sheppard Ken says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 7:18 am\n\nThank you, Philip! What a gift. Honesty and genuine humility on both sides.\nAnd you\u2019re so spot on: it\u2019s all about grace. All else is one form or another\nof skubala and will end up on the ash heap of eternity. Again, thank you.\n\nReply\n\n  51. Joanne Guarnieri Hagemeyer says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 6:53 am\n\nReally enjoyed reading this conversation. I\u2019ve come to learn that being\ngracious and kind, enjoying affection and offering respect is available to us\nall. It may feel costly in the moment, but the benefits will always far\noutweigh. In a world where sorrow, loss, trauma, desperation and rage hold\nsway, every ray of grace and warmth of affection a person offers changes the\nbalance in noticeable ways.\n\nThank you for your graciousness, and for sharing a glimpse of your friendship\nwith someone who is other. May the grace you both have offered today bring\nwarmth to your readers.\n\nReply\n\n  52. Diane Kulkarni says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 6:50 am\n\nThank you, Mr. Yancey for giving us an inside view to God who initiates our\neternal relationship and gives faith to those who do not seek Him. The quote\nwith which you concluded this amazing exchange is perfect.\n\nReply\n\n  53. Michael N. Allen says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 6:46 am\n\nA good example of honest, respectful, humble dialog between a Christian and\none who has deconstructed his faith.\n\nReply\n\n  54. John McCustion says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 6:44 am\n\nIt\u2019s so sad to me the trauma Evangelical Christianity (though I\u2019d prefer to\ncall it churchism) has caused. I\u2019d say Bart\u201ds description of conversion is\nmore \u201ccoercion\u201d (but \u201cmanipulation\u201d is probably more accurate but didn\u2019t sound\nas poetic). Are you familiar with spiral dynamics? It\u2019s a bit weighty for me,\nbut I\u2019d be interested in hearing your thoughts on it as it relates to our\nthoughts of God.\n\nReply\n\n     * Philip Yancey says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 9:46 am\n\nNo, I\u2019m not familiar, but I\u2019ll try to research it.\n\nReply\n\n  55. Sandra Grant says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 6:43 am\n\nWow! What a great dialogue from opposite sides (perhaps) of a spiritual\nsituation. And there was no yelling, no name-calling, no disrespect, no\ncondemnation. Hmmm. Are you even real? Just kidding. We are not used to this\nkind of debate any more. Sad it doesn\u2019t happen more frequently. Thanks to both\nof you for sharing your views.\n\nReply\n\n  56. Linda L Hoenigsberg says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 6:37 am\n\nPhilip...like you, I had to \u201cdeconstruct\u201d from toxic faith and like you, I\n\u201creconstructed\u201d and still love Jesus with all my heart. Your books helped me\ndo that. Thank you.\n\nReply\n\n  57. Peter Reece says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 6:35 am\n\nBeing of ancient vintage, if I have learnt one thing its this: When all the\ndiscussions have finally been completed, some will believe and some will not.\nI cant explain the in-between bits! Every blessing,\n\nReply\n\n  58. Cindy says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 6:31 am\n\nYour books have given words to my doubts, questions and fears for many years\nand always ground me in the God Who Is. Where the Light Fell was one of the\nmost important books I ever read. Thank you for never being afraid to wrestle\nwith the tough questions.\n\nReply\n\n  59. Joe Pop says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 6:30 am\n\nHow refreshing. A grace-filled conversation with the \u201cenemy\u201d. I see far too\nmuch from the evangelical church (including the one that I half-heartedly\nattend) where the topic of deconstruction is looked upon as just another\nbattle of the culture wars to be won. Deconstruction is viewed as simply\nanother evil that is a result of a sick, depraved, individualistic society,\nwithout considering that the reason so many (including myself) are\ndeconstructing is because of the Church itself. I believe the Evangelical\nChurch must first seriously consider their own engagement with culture that\nhas included judgement, nationalism, and hypocritical engagement in politics,\nbefore looking outside of itself for reasons behind the deconstruction\nmovement. How about a little more of that grace, and love that Jesus seemed to\nbe obsessed with. Thanks for being a voice for those of us that feel like we\ndon\u2019t belong to this Christian faith.\n\nReply\n\n  60. Stephanie Smith says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 6:20 am\n\nWow! Beautifully written. How does one \u201cexplain\u201d conversion? Perhaps there is\nno explanation, only a result? The term \u201cworldview humility\u201d is something I\u2019ll\nbe pondering on. How to bear witness to Truth while retaining a genuine\n\u201cworldview humility\u201d is a tension I need to learn to better embrace.\n\nReply\n\n  61. Covlin Deaton says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 6:13 am\n\nThank you for sharing this. So many in my orbit have taken the way of Bart\n(perhaps staying a little closer to Jesus, but idk.) Old Church of Christ\nbackground hard to unclothe. Still trusting Jesus to get me home.\n\nReply\n\n  62. Paul Jensen says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 5:59 am\n\nThank you Philip and Bart. As I was reading your exchange I was led to think\nagain of the Andrew Klaven memoir The Great Good Thing: A Secular Jew Comes to\nFaith in Christ. I\u2019ve read most of Klaven\u2019s fiction (thrillers) and knew that\nsomehow he had come to faith in God the Son. Why some people accept God\u2019s\ngrace and others reject it is a deep mystery. Philip and Andrew accept and\nBart rejects. Is there any way to figure that out? I think not. The deepest\nmystery to me is, as the apostle wrote, not that we love God, but that he\nloves us and that of course includes Bart Compolo.\n\nReply\n\n  63. Heidi says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 5:57 am\n\nThank you both for this honest discussion, for modeling dignity, humility,\ngrace and love toward one another ... to me there is no greater evidence of a\nloving God than this.\n\nReply\n\n  64. Steve Moran says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 5:47 am\n\nI heard Bart speak one time when he delivered a commencement address at a\ncollege in northern California. Loved, still love mission year concept. Tony\nwas a huge influence on me as a young adult.\n\nI find myself wondering two things about Barts conversion:\n\n1\\. How much of that move was influenced by the academic distain for\nChristianity. We are all hugely influenced by society more than we care to\nadmit.\n\n2\\. In the United States we are well into this new dechurching decristianizing\nof society and accompanying this is increased, stress, violence and hate.\n\nAre Athiests really happier than Christians? I am not so sure. I guess what is\nmost puzzling is why an Athiest would see compassion as having any value at\nall? As long as I get what I want on this life I am good.\n\nIf the earth ends if humanity ends so what? It is just evolution.\n\nAnd yet atheists have a new god which is the environment and they are willing\nto make housing harder for the homeless, commuting more expensive for the poor\nand on and on.\n\nReply\n\n  65. David A. Fraser says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 5:43 am\n\nDeee-lighted (to echo Teddy R.) to read this. Absolutely wonderful. Having\nworked closely with Tony C. for a number of years and written a book with him,\nI see some of this from the architecture of the family dynamics of the\nCampolos. Coming from a family myself, most of whom never crossed the river\nfrom the non-religious side or lived in the just as messy world of nominal\nliberal Christianity (which is largely on that side of the river), I crossed\nin the opposite direction. The Christian humanism of Tony lives vividly in\nBarth (so it seems to me) without the Christian roots that developed that\npassionate desire to see goodness and justice for all. My experience in World\nVision is that such a vision without religious roots eventually withers.\nWorking with the margins of human devastation for years gradually evaporates\nthe motivation and saps the emotional stamina necessary for the long haul. The\nunanswered question for humanists is why? What is the enduring and\ntranscendent rationale for such self-sacrifice? Or for kindness toward others\ninstead of the killing of a Mao or Stalin in the name of a secular\neschatology? In my wager, believing that everyone who looks in a mirror sees\nsomething of God, makes a fundamental difference. If we are not made in the\nimage of God and reflect that, we are no more than the image of a long\nevolution ending up as part of a family of primates, on a speck of dust we\nseek to dominate, within a third rate solar system which expresses an\nindifferent and brutally violent universe. And all of it goes away. We wind up\nas dust in a grave. Why care for anyone but myself?\n\nReply\n\n  66. Judi Flickinger says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 5:37 am\n\nWow! Amazing correspondence. As I sit here at 6am reading this in the dark, I\nfeel blessed to \u201cknow\u201d you both. Thank you.\n\nReply\n\n  67. Greg Jenks says:\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 5:32 am\n\nI loved this dialogue. I am a fellow CBCer and met you at ETS in Denver a few\nyears back. Your blogs speak encouragement and hope to me.
