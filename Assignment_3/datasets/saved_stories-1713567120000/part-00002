The storms\nforced schools, offices, and businesses to close, transformed the tarmac of\nDubai\u2019s international airport into a rippling sea, and killed more than 20\npeople across both nations. The downpour seemed almost apocalyptic: On\nTuesday, the UAE received the amount of rain that usually falls in an entire\nyear.\n\nEarly reports of the weather event prompted some speculation that it was\nworsened by a controversial weather-modification technology. The practice,\nknown as cloud seeding, involves spraying chemical compounds into the air in\nan effort to wring more rain out of the sky. The United Arab Emirates carries\nout hundreds of these operations every year in an effort to supplement its\nwater resources in the arid landscape. Exactly how well cloud seeding actually\nworks is an active debate among scientists, but the technique can\u2019t produce\nrain clouds out of thin air\u2014it can only enhance what\u2019s already there.\n\nThe consensus, for now, seems to be that cloud seeding is unlikely to have\ncontributed significantly to this week\u2019s historic inundation. (The UAE\u2019s\nmeteorology agency said no seeding missions were conducted before the storm.)\nBut the event raises anew some fundamental questions about interfering with\nnature. Cloud seeding is a type of geoengineering, a set of technologies aimed\ndeliberately at influencing or altering Earth\u2019s climate systems. The warmer\nour planet becomes, the more attractive geoengineering seems as a way to slow\nor endure the effects of climate change\u2014and the less accurately we can predict\nits effects. Scientists can\u2019t be sure that playing God with the atmosphere\nwon\u2019t cause human suffering, even if it is intended to alleviate it.\n\nIn the case of cloud seeding, humans have been playing God for decades. The\ntechnique dates back to the 1940s and has been deployed regularly around the\nworld since to provide relief to regions parched by drought, clear skies ahead\nof Olympic Games, and give ski resorts an extra inch of snow. Scientists have\nbeen studying cloud seeding all along, but they\u2019ve only recently managed to\ndocument how the technique might actually work, distinguishing between natural\nprecipitation and precipitation that resulted from human intervention. Experts\nbelieve that seeding can squeeze out a small amount of additional\nprecipitation, but it is \u201cnotoriously difficult\u201d to determine how well it\nworked in any particular instance, Janette Lindesay, a climate scientist at\nAustralian National University, told me.\n\nRead: The chemist who thought he could harness hurricanes\n\nThe basics of cloud seeding are straightforward, Lindesay said: If you want\nrain, you release chemicals that encourage clouds to produce larger water\ndroplets, which are more likely to reach the ground. If you want to suppress\nrain, you use chemicals that foster the creation of smaller droplets. But the\nsimplicity belies the complicated science and high stakes of manipulating the\natmosphere in the 21st century. The 2020s are becoming defined by a warmer\natmosphere capable of holding more moisture, conditions that can lead to more\nextreme and unprecedented weather events, including intense rainfall. Add in\ngeoengineering, and things can get risky. \u201cWe are in territory now where we\ncan\u2019t necessarily rely on past experience and past outcomes to inform us,\u201d\nLindesay said, of \u201cwhat is likely to happen when we intervene.\u201d\n\nAs geoengineering goes, cloud seeding is a rather limited technique, with\nsmall effects confined to small geographical areas. (That\u2019s part of the case\nagainst seeding as a significant contributing factor to this week\u2019s flooding\nin the Middle East; as Amit Katwala pointed out in Wired this week, parts of\nthe UAE where seeding typically does not occur experienced torrential rain\ntoo.) But it can still be fraught. Scientists continue to debate whether cloud\nseeding in one region can have consequences for another. And at a time when\ndroughts are becoming more common, rain is a precious commodity with\ngeopolitical import. In recent years, Iran has accused the UAE and Israel,\nwhich has its own seeding experiments, of stealing rain away.\n\nReports that cloud seeding caused this week\u2019s flooding were likely erroneous,\nbut the reaction they inspired \u201crepresents a healthy kind of skepticism about\nwhat happens when we interfere with natural systems,\u201d Laura Kuhl, a public-\npolicy professor at Northeastern University who studies climate adaptation,\ntold me. That\u2019s particularly true, she said, when you consider forms of\ngeoengineering premised on producing large-scale effects. Scientists have\nproposed injecting sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to reflect some\nsunlight back into space, preventing it from reaching Earth\u2019s surface. The\nresulting aerosols could linger in the stratosphere for years, shifting at the\nwhims of the wind. Similar concerns surround another geoengineering technique\nthat involves spraying salt compounds into the air to brighten clouds, which\nwould in turn bounce sunlight back into space. This month, scientists\nconducted a secretive test of this technology, the first of its kind in the\nUnited States. The field is \u201cmoving a lot faster than it used to,\u201d Juan\nMoreno-Cruz, a climate-policy researcher at the University of Waterloo, told\nme.\n\nRead: The very optimistic new argument for dimming the sky\n\nAfter further research, some geoengineering techniques may well turn out to be\nuseful ways to mitigate or adapt to climate change. But they can\u2019t address its\nroot cause: the burning of fossil fuels, and failure to reduce greenhouse\nemissions. Many climate experts see geoengineering as a last resort. As our\nchanging atmosphere continues to dramatically drench some parts of the planet\nand leave others parched for too long, that last resort might start to seem\nlike a more appealing option\u2014even as the consequences of getting it wrong\nbecome ever more dire.\n\nMarina Koren is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
