Ron DeSantis last May, SB264 (23R) prohibits\nnationals from China, Cuba, Venezuela, Syria, Iran, Russia and North Korea\nfrom buying homes in the state.\n\nThat month, a lawsuit was filed by the ACLU, ACLU of Florida, DeHeng Law\nOffices, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) and the\nChinese American Legal Defense Alliance (CALDA) on behalf of four Chinese\ncitizens and a Florida real estate brokerage that mainly serves Chinese\nclients, alleging the ban was discriminatory.\n\nThe lawsuit, Shen vs. Simpson, did not list DeSantis as a defendant. The\ndefendants are Wilton Simpson, Florida's agriculture commissioner; Meredith\nIvey, then the state's acting secretary of economic opportunity; and Patricia\nFitzgerald, then chair of the Florida Real Estate Commission.\n\nThe three defendants did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe circuit court in February blocked the law from being enforced against two\nof the individual plaintiffs ahead of a decision on the merits of the appeal.\nThe court unanimously held that the plaintiffs \"showed a substantial\nlikelihood of success on their claim\" that the ban is \"preempted by federal\nlaw,\" court documents show.\n\nBethany Li, legal director of AALDEF, told Nikkei Asia there has been an\n\"unintended impact\" of the ban, involving Chinese who are renting property\nspaces. Li cited an incident in which a Florida landlord asked a Chinese\ncommercial real estate company that had been renting the space for years to\nvacate before the law went into effect last July.\n\n\"That's not because of anything that the law says,\" Li said. \"I think [it's]\nthe broader stigmatization and chilling effect that the law has created for\nnot only Chinese people in the state of Florida, but Asian Americans in\ngeneral.\"\n\nHer organization is partnering with community and grassroots groups to devise\nways to oppose similar laws nationwide. As of last May, 33 U.S. states have\nintroduced some form of property legislation, according to APA Justice. About\n11 states have passed such legislation including Texas, North Dakota and\nOklahoma. Some bills failed, while others are still pending.\n\n\"Florida's law is the most egregious. It's the most sweeping. It's the worst\nfor its criminal penalties on Chinese people,\" Li said. \"But there're a lot of\nlaws that have passed, unfortunately, in other states that have a similar\neffect in terms of wanting to keep Chinese people out.\"\n\nUnder the Florida law, Chinese citizens buying homes could face up to five\nyears in prison, the seller could face up to one year in prison, and both\nsides can be fined thousands of dollars.\n\nThe court could rule that Florida's alien land law is unconstitutional,\npreempted by federal law and violates the Fair Housing Act. But the decision\ncould take months.\n\nDeSantis touted the property ban last year during his presidential campaign\nbefore dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump appear headed for a\nrematch in the November election, and as it nears, Li said the Asian American\ncommunity is concerned about worsening anti-Asian behaviors in the U.S.\n\n\"I think the fact that these types of laws are even passing in different\nstates is a result of the kind of increased anti-China rhetoric that we saw\nduring the Trump administration,\" Li said. \"But honestly, I think we've seen\nthis rhetoric [in both the Republican and Democratic parties].\"\n\n\"I think politicians score easy points by making the Chinese government the\nenemy,\" she said. \"But what ends up happening is that it's really Chinese\npeople and Asian Americans here that end up being harmed by many of these\nstatements and much of this discriminatory rhetoric, because it gives the\ngeneral impression that it's OK to attack even Americans.\"\n\n## Read Next\n\n  * Supply Chain\n\n#### Nokia cuts orders with China-listed supplier as U.S. pushes 'clean\nnetwork'\n\n  * China up close\n\n#### Analysis: Why Xi and Biden chose the same day to send a message on Taiwan\n\n  * Trade\n\n#### Biden calls for tripling tariffs on Chinese steel\n\n  * China tech\n\n#### Sanctioned Chinese security camera maker Dahua divests from U.S.\n\n  * Opinion\n\n#### U.S.-China fight over manufacturing subsidies just getting started\n\n## Latest On US-China tensions\n\n  * US-China tensions\n\n#### U.S., China officials discuss Middle East, Taiwan, South China Sea\n\n  * US-China tensions\n\n#### China sanctions two U.S. defense firms for selling Taiwan weapons\n\n  * US-China tensions\n\n#### Yellen meets China's Premier Li amid 'tough conversations' on industry\n\n## Sponsored Content\n\n### About Sponsored Content This content was commissioned by Nikkei's Global\nBusiness Bureau.\n\nDiscover the all new Nikkei Asia app\n\n#### Get Insights on Asia in your inbox\n\nRegister for our newsletters\n\n#### Connect With Us\n\nNikkei Inc.
