The answer was \"yes.\" I quickly needed\nto find something else to do. A friend wrote for The Motley Fool and said I\nshould look into it. I did, and it's been an amazing experience ever since.\n\nYou can always catch me around Twitter.\n\nHere are the most important things I learned in nine years.\n\nInvestment fees are falling. Investment costs are not. Index fund fees now\nround to zero. That's a big win for investors. But the emotional cost of\ninvesting is as high as it's ever been. The massive increase in financial\nmedia is great, but it has a downside: We are bombarded with more headlines\nthan ever that feed on greed, fear, and doubt, making it easier than ever to\nget sidetracked into ruts of excitement, confusion, and pessimism. Everything\nthat's valuable has a cost. The biggest cost in investing is the emotions of\nbeing uncomfortable, not knowing what the future will bring and wondering if\nyou're doing the right thing. These costs are orders of magnitudes larger than\nfees paid to advisors, and their currency is stress hormones rather than\ndollars. A lot of investors realize they can't afford these costs, and quit.\nBut paying them, for those who can, is as worthwhile as it's ever been.\n\nMost investing success boils down to avoiding catastrophic mistakes. Few\n\"good\" decisions are needed to do well over time. This is a new development in\nthe investing world. In the past, successful investing meant being on the\ninside, with access to the products and information required to do well.\nToday, every tool needed for success is available to every investor, no matter\nhow small. Low-cost funds, news, disclosures, tracking software. They're all\nthere for everyone to use. All you have to do is keep your head on straight\nand not screw it up. That's the only skill investing requires these days.\n\nMost investing mistakes and frustrations come from trying to run a marathon in\nan hour. Diversified investing is so simple. Companies earn profits, and over\na long period of time those profits accrue to shareholders. If you leave it at\nthat \u2013 and you should \u2013 investing is such a basic game that doesn't require\nmuch action. But instead of letting profits accrue over time, a lot of the\ninvestment industry attempts to speed up the process by front-loading gains\ninto shorter periods. This is done by guessing what other investors will do\nnext and trying to get ahead of them. It's a billion times harder than true\ninvesting, and it's the cause of most investment mistakes. Alas, it's too\npotentially lucrative for many to pass up.\n\nProgress happens too slowly to notice; setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.\nThe market quickly lost 38% in 2008, and it was huge deal. Books were written\nabout it, and Congressional hearings were held. We'll be talking about it for\ndecades. The market then slowly tripled from 2009 to 2015, and barely anyone\nflinched. You had to sit down and show people the numbers to get them to\nbelieve you. This is common: Recessions take place over months; recoveries\ntake place over years. It can takes decades for companies to become valuable,\nbut bankruptcies happen overnight. Pain hurts more than the same level of gain\nfeels good, but the duration differences between progress and setbacks helps\nexplain why there are so many pessimists amid a backdrop of things getting\nbetter over time.\n\nFew things are more valuable than room for error. Having a big gap between\nwhat could happen and what you need to have happen to meet your goals is\npriceless. Long-term success has more to do with the ability to constantly\nshrug your shoulders at the world's unpredictability than it does constantly\nbeing right.\n\n\"Don't do anything\" is the best advice for most people most of the time, but\nit's not intellectually stimulating enough for many people to take seriously.\nMost fields have a positive correlation between effort and results. Investing\nis one of few where the correlation is negative, especially for amateurs. The\nhigher your IQ is, the harder it is to accept this.\n\nNo one is smarter than the collective intelligence of millions of other\ninvestors. Some, however, are a little more patient and less emotional. That's\nwhere the potential for \"edge\" is found. Thirty years ago investing was mostly\nan analytical game, because information was scarce and computers weren't\nscouring the world for mispriced assets. That's changed. Most analytical\nopportunity has now been fully exploited. But there's still huge opportunity\nto gain an edge over most investors through patience and good behavior.\n\nThere has never been a better time to be an investor. Ever, in history. More\npeople have access to first-class services than ever before. It's so\nimportant, and we don't spend enough time realizing how good it is.\n\nThanks for a great nine years.\n\nFor more:\n\n  * Why does pessimism sound so smart?\n  * Why we're terrified of typical\n  * Is today's market more volatile than the past?\n  * The evolution of good investing ideas\n\nContact Morgan Housel at mhousel@gmail.com.
