The index is\nusing options from the pay package \u2014 which is one of the South African\nentrepreneur\u2019s largest assets \u2014 into its calculations of his wealth.\n\n3\n\nElon Musk saw some reversals of fortune this year that took a hit on his net\nworth. AFP via Getty Images\n\nZuckerberg has not seen a top three spot on the Bloomberg ranking since Nov.\n16, 2020, when he was worth $105.6 billion, compared to Musk\u2019s $102.1 billion.\n\nIn November 2021, the wealth gap between the Meta and Tesla titans was as\nlarge as $215 billion, Bloomberg noted.\n\n3\n\nElon Musk acquired X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022. REUTERS\n\nWhat do you think? Post a comment.\n\nThe two billionaires have long been engaged in a lengthy public back-and-forth\n\u2014 and even traded threats to spar in a cage fight last year.\n\nZuckerberg, however, called off the idea in August 2023, saying that it was\n\u201ctime to move on.\u201d\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * billionaires\n  * bloomberg\n  * elon musk\n  * mark zuckerberg\n  * meta\n  * tesla\n  * 4/6/24\n\nRead Next Instacart debuts AI-driven 'smart carts' to Big Apple reta...\n\n## Columnists\n\n  * ### \n\nCharles Gasparino\n\n#### Keep an eye out on these big-money donors with the 2024 election\napproaching\n\n  * ### \n\nLydia Moynihan\n\n#### Diddy faces cash crisis with billionaire lifestyle, soaring lawyers' fees\nand no obvious income\n\n  * ### \n\nSteve Cuozzo\n\n#### Lower Manhattan office space 'tours' on the rise despite Downtown's\nstruggling properties\n\n### See All Columnists\n\n#### Trending Now in Business\n\n  * This story has been shared 3,027 times. 3,027\n\n### Costco offering weight-loss drug prescriptions to members for $179:\n'Important innovations'\n\n  * This story has been shared 2,068 times. 2,068\n\n### Apple's upcoming iOS 18 update \u2014 touted as its 'biggest' \u2014 will only be\ncompatible with these iPhone models\n\n  * This story has been shared 1,719 times. 1,719\n\n### Keep an eye out on these big-money donors with the 2024 election\napproaching\n\n## Now on Page Six\n\n  * ### Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian wear matching snakeskin swimsuits during Turks and Caicos vacation\n\n  * ### Russell Simmons shares supportive pics of daughter Aoki amid her controversial romance with Vittorio Assaf\n\n  * ### Morgan Wallen fans savagely boo Taylor Swift after singer makes joke at Indianapolis show\n\nSee All\n\n#### Video\n\n  * ### Sandals Resorts exec resigns after partner sacked over caught-on-film brawl: sources\n\nMark Zuckerberg is now third on the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.
