Currently, we\nface a critical challenge: our electricity demands \u2014 expected to nearly double\nby 2040 due to factors like AI compute, reshoring, and \u201celectrification\u201d \u2014 are\nsoaring, but our grid infrastructure and operations struggle to keep pace.\n\nTo seize a future of energy abundance, we must simplify the generation,\ntransmission, and consumption of electricity; this entails decentralizing the\ngrid. Big power plants and long power lines are burdensome to build, but\ntechnologies like solar, batteries, and advanced nuclear reactors present new\npossibilities. It will be these, and other more \u201clocal\u201d technologies, that can\ncircumvent costly long-haul wiring and be placed directly on-site that will\nhelp support significant load growth over the coming decades.\n\nWhile historical industrial expansion relied on large, centralized power\nplants, the 21st century marks a shift towards decentralized and intermittent\nenergy sources, transitioning from a \u201chub and spoke\u201d model to more of a\ndistributed network. Of course, such evolutions breed new challenges, and we\nneed innovation to bridge the gap.\n\n##\n\nGrowing pains\n\nThe United States electric grid comprises three major interconnections: East,\nWest, and Texas, managed by 17 NERC coordinators, with ISOs (independent\nsystem operator) and RTOs (regional transmission operator) overseeing regional\neconomics and infrastructure. However, actual power generation and delivery\nare handled by local utilities or cooperatives. This structure functioned in\nan era of low load growth, but expanding the grid\u2019s infrastructure to meet\ntoday\u2019s demand is becoming increasingly challenging and expensive.\n\n###\n\nConnection issues\n\nGrid operators use an interconnection queue to manage new asset connections,\nevaluating if the grid can support the added power at that location without\nimbalance, and determining the cost of necessary upgrades. Today, more than\n2,000 gigawatts (GW) are waiting to connect, with over 700 GW of projects\nentering queues in 2022 alone. This is a lot: the entire United States\nelectric grid only has 1,200 GW of installed generation capacity.\n\nIn reality, however, many projects withdraw after confronting the costs of\ngrid connection. Historically, only 10-20% of queued projects have\nmaterialized, often taking over 5 years post-application to finally connect \u2014\nand those timelines are only lengthening. Developers frequently submit\nmultiple speculative proposals to identify the cheapest interconnection point,\nthen withdraw unfavorable ones after costs are known, complicating feasibility\nstudies. Because of this surge in applications, CAISO, California\u2019s grid\noperator, was forced to stop accepting any new requests in 2022, and plans to\ndo so again in 2024.\n\nThis is a critical ratelimiter and cost driver in our energy transition. A\nrecent report by the Department of Energy found that to meet high-load growth\nby 2035, within-region transmission to integrate new assets must increase by\n128% and inter-region transmission by 412%. Even far more optimistic\nprojections estimate 64% and 34% growth, respectively.\n\nThere are proposed reforms to help alleviate this development backlog. The\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is pushing a \u201cfirst ready, first\nserve\u201d policy, adding fees to filter proposals and speed up reviews. The\nElectric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) utilizes a \u201cconnect and manage\u201d\nmethod that allows for quicker connections, but disconnects projects if they\nthreaten grid reliability \u2013 this has been remarkably successful in quickly\nadding new grid assets. While these policies mark progress, streamlining other\nregulations, such as NEPA, is also crucial to expedite buildout.\n\nBut even if approved, grid construction still faces supply chain hurdles,\nincluding lead times of more than 12 months and a 400% price surge for large-\npower transformers, compounded by a shortage of specialized steel. Achieving a\nfederal goal to grow transformer manufacturing hinges on also supporting the\nelectric steel industry, especially with upcoming 2027 efficiency standards.\nAll of this comes at a time when grid outages (largely weather-related) are at\na 20-year high, necessitating replacement hardware.\n\n###\n\nDelivery not included\n\nUltimately, cost overhauls in building grid infrastructure manifest themselves\nin higher prices for consumers. The \u201cretail price\u201d that consumers pay is a\ncombination of wholesale prices (generation costs) and delivery fees (the cost\nof the infrastructure needed to move that electricity to you). Critically,\nwhile the price to generate electricity has declined with cheap renewables and\nnatural gas, the price to deliver it has increased by a far greater amount.\n\nThere are many reasons for this. Utilities use distribution charges to offset\nlosses from customer-generated power, aiming to secure revenue from fixed-\nreturn infrastructure investments (similar to cost-plus defense contracting).\nRenewable energy development requires extending power lines to remote areas,\nand these lines are used less due to intermittency. Additionally,\ninfrastructure designed for peak demand becomes inefficient and costly as load\nbecomes more volatile with greater electrification and self-generation.\n\nPolicy and market adjustments are responding to these rising delivery costs,\nwith California\u2019s high adoption of distributed power systems, such as rooftop\nsolar, serving as a notable example.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Net Energy Metering (NEM) program initially let homeowners sell\nsurplus solar power back to the grid at retail prices, ignoring the costs to\nutilities for power distribution. Recent changes now essentially buy back\nelectricity at variable wholesale rates, reducing earnings for solar panel\nowners during peak generation times, which often coincide with the lowest\nelectricity prices. This adjustment lengthens the payback period for solar\ninstallations, pushing homeowners and businesses to invest in storage to sell\nenergy at more profitable times.\n\nCalifornia utilities also proposed a billing model where fixed charges depend\non income level and usage charges depend on consumption. This aimed to make\nwealthier customers cover more of the grid infrastructure costs, protecting\nlower-income individuals from rising retail power prices. And although this\nspecific policy was recently shelved for a similar, but less extreme, version,\nideas like this might lead affluent users to disconnect from the grid\nentirely. Defection could lead to higher costs for remaining users and trigger\na \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d Some argue this is already happening in Hawaii\u2019s electricity\nmarket and in areas rapidly switching to electric heat pumps.\n\n##\n\nKeeping the lights on\n\nElectricity is not magic; grid operations are complicated. At all times,\nelectricity generated must match electricity demand, or \u201cload\u201d; this is what\npeople mean when they say \u201cbalance the grid.\u201d At a high level, grid stability\nrelies on maintaining a constant frequency \u2014 60 Hz in the United States.\n\nCongestion from exceeding power line capacities leads to curtailments (dumping\nelectricity) and local price disparities. Any frequency deviations can also\ncause equipment damages to generators and motors. Wind, solar, and batteries \u2014\ninverted-based resources lacking inertia \u2014 also complicate frequency\nstabilization as they proliferate. In extreme cases, deviations may provoke\nblackouts or even destroy grid-connected equipment.\n\nBecause of the grid\u2019s inherent fragility, careful consideration must be made\nto assets connected to it, aligning reliable supply with forecasted demand.\nThe growth of intermittent power sources (unreliable supply) coinciding with\nthe rise of \u201celectrification\u201d (spiky demand) is causing serious challenges.\n\n###\n\nWhen is enough, enough?\n\nAround two-thirds of load is balanced by wholesale markets through (mostly)\nday-ahead auctions, where prices are determined by the cost of the last unit\nof power needed. Renewables, with no marginal cost, typically outbid others\nwhen active, leading to price volatility \u2014 extreme lows when renewables meet\ndemand and spikes when costlier sources are needed (note: bid price is\ndifferent from levelized cost of energy (LCOE).)\n\nThe unpredictability of solar and wind, alongside the shutdown of aging fossil\nfuel plants, strain grid stability. This leads to both blackouts\n(underproduction) and curtailment (overproduction), like California\u2019s 2,400\nGWh waste in 2022. Addressing this requires investment in energy storage and\ntransmission improvements (discussed below).\n\nMoreover, as power supply becomes more unpredictable, the role of natural gas\ngrows due to its cost-effectiveness and flexibility. Natural gas often backs\nup renewables with \u201cpeaker plants\u201d that activate only when needed. In general,\nthe intermittency of solar and wind subjects natural gas plants, and other\ntypes of plants, to profit intermittently, sometimes even running continuously\nat a loss for technical reasons. Consequently, when \u201cpeaker plants\u201d set\nwholesale prices when renewables are offline, it leads to higher costs and\nthus volatility for consumers.\n\nThe demand for electricity is also changing shape. Technologies like heat\npumps, while energy-efficient, can cause winter load spikes when renewable\noutput may be low. This requires grid operators to keep a buffer of power\nassets, and often ignore renewable sources in their resource adequacy\nplanning. Grid operators typically adhere to a \u201c1 in 10\u201d rule, accepting a\npower shortfall once every decade, though the actual calculation is more\ncomplex. In ERCOT, which lacks a traditional capacity market in lieu of price\nspike incentives, we\u2019ve already seen \u201cemergency reserves\u201d grow as renewable\u2019s\nenter the grid.\n\nHigh-solar-penetration areas, like California, also face the \u201cduck curve,\u201d\nrequiring grid operators to quickly ramp up over 20 GW of power as daylight\nfades and demand rises. This is technologically and economically challenging\nfor plants intended for constant output.\n\nRenewable intermittency incurs hidden costs, forcing grid operators to embrace\nrisk or invest in new assets. While the levelized cost of energy assesses a\nproject\u2019s economic feasibility, it oversimplifies the asset\u2019s true value to\nthe broader grid. LCOE does, however, underscore the economic challenges of\nconstructing new assets, like nuclear plants. Despite being costlier than\nnatural gas today, nuclear offers a compelling path to decarbonizing reliable\npower. We just need to scale reactor buildout.\n\nBut we can\u2019t just rely on nuclear power. Relying solely on a single energy\nsource is risky, as shown by France\u2019s nuclear challenges during Russian energy\nsanctions and the southern United States\u2019 issues with natural gas in cold\nweather, not to mention commodity price swings. Regions with lots of\nrenewables, like California, also face uncertainty due to routine reliance on\nimports. Even places operating at nearly 100% clean energy, like Iceland or\nScandinavia, maintain reliable backups or import options during crises.\n\n##\n\nGetting smart\n\nAs electricity demand grows, the grid struggles to manage growing complexity\nfrom both decentralization and intermittent renewables. We cannot brute force\nthis shift; if we\u2019re going to do it, we really need to get smart.\n\nThe current grid, aging and \u201cdumb,\u201d depends on power plants to align\nproduction based on predicted demand, while making small, real-time\nadjustments to ensure stability. Originally designed for one-way flow from\nlarge power plants, the grid is challenged by the concept of multiple small\nsources contributing power in various directions, like your rooftop solar\ncharging a neighbor\u2019s electric vehicle. Moreover, the lack of real visibility\ninto live power flow presents looming issues, specifically at the distribution\nlevel.\n\nResidential solar, batteries, advanced nuclear, and (possibly) geothermal\nprovide decentralized power that reduces the need for infrastructure buildout.\nYet integration into an evolving, volatile grid still demands innovative\nsolutions. Additionally, efficient use of even utility-scale power systems can\nalso be significantly improved by local storage and demand-side responses \u2013\nlike turning down your thermostat when the grid is strained \u2013 that reduce the\nneed to build underutilized assets that are online for only brief peak\nperiods.\n\nThe \u201csmart grid\u201d aims to accomplish all of this and more, and can be organized\ninto three main technology groups:\n\n  * Ahead-of-the-meter\n\n    * Dynamic line rating, solid-state transformers, voltage management and power flow systems, better conductors, infrastructure monitoring, grid-scale power generation, grid-scale storage, etc.\n  * Behind-the-meter\n\n    * Heat pumps, electric appliances, residential solar, home energy storage, electric vehicle chargers, smart thermostats, smart meters, microreactors and small modular reactors, microgrids, etc.\n  * Grid software\n\n    * Virtual power plants, better forecasting, device management, energy data infrastructure, cybersecurity, ADMS, interconnection planning, electricity financial instruments, bilateral agreement automation, etc.\n\nSpecifically, there are two broad trends that are crucial for the \u201csmart grid\u201d\nfuture.\n\nFirst, we need to build a lot of energy storage to smooth out peak load\nlocally and stabilize intermittent power supply across the grid. Batteries are\nalready critical for small bursts of power, and, as prices continue to\ndecline, even longer periods of time could be covered. But scaling hundreds of\ngigawatt-hours of batteries will also require expanded supply chains.\nFortunately, strong economics will likely continue to accelerate deployment;\nentrepreneurs should seek to connect batteries anywhere they can.\n\nSecond, we need to accelerate the deployment and integration of a network of\ndistributed energy assets. Anything that can be electrified will be\nelectrified. Allowing these systems to interact with home and grid-scale\nenergy systems will require a variety of new solutions. Aggregations of\n\u201csmart\u201d devices, like electric vehicles or thermostats, could even form\nvirtual power plants that mimic the behavior of much larger energy assets.\n\n##\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nA core challenge in grid expansion is carefully balancing the shift between\ncentralized and decentralized systems, considering economic and reliability\nconcerns. Centralized grids, while straightforward and (generally) reliable,\nface issues with complex demand fluctuations and high fixed costs \u2013 for\nexample, most large nuclear plants globally are government-financed and China\ncan build a ton of big power assets, but it does so very inefficiently.\nDecentralized grids, while still in early stages of deployment, are cheap but\ndon\u2019t automatically ensure reliable power, as preferences in some rural Indian\ncommunities indicate.\n\nTo be clear, the centralized grid we have today will certainly not disappear \u2013\nin fact, it also needs to grow in size \u2013 but it will be consumed by networks\nof decentralized assets growing around it. Ratepayers will increasingly adopt\nself-generation and storage, challenging traditional electricity monopolies\nand prompting regulatory and market reform. This self-generation trend will\nreach its extreme in energy-intensive industries that especially prioritize\nreliability \u2013 Amazon and Microsoft are already pursuing nuclear-powered data\ncenters, and we should do everything we can to accelerate the development and\ndeployment of new reactors.\n\nMore broadly, ratepayers want reliable, affordable, and clean power, typically\nin that order. ERCOT, with its blessed geography, innovation-receptive\n\u201cenergy-only\u201d markets, and relaxed interconnection policy, will be key to\nwatch in order to see if, when, and how this is achieved with a decentralized\ngrid. And successfully navigating this shift will, no doubt, result in\nsignificant economic growth.\n\nCritically, to build this decentralized grid demands our most talented\nentrepreneurs and engineers: We need a \u201csmart grid\u201d with serious innovation\nacross ahead-of-the-meter, behind-the-meter, and grid software technology.\nPolicy and economic tailwinds will accelerate this electricity evolution, but\nit will fall to the private sector to ensure this decentralized grid works\nbetter than the old one.\n\nThe future of the United States\u2019 electric grid lies in harnessing new\ntechnology and embracing free-markets to overcome our nation\u2019s challenges,\npaving the way for a more efficient and dynamic energy landscape. This is one\nof the great undertakings of the 21st century, but we must meet the\nchallenges.\n\nThe world is changing fast, and the electric grid must change with it.
