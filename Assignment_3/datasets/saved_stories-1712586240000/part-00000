Earlier this year the\nprogramme ignited a public furore about the Post Office scandal.\n\nBates, who appeared before MPs in January, will give evidence to the inquiry\non Tuesday.\n\nAdam Crozier left Royal Mail in 2010 to run ITV, leaving in 2017. Photograph:\nKantar/Reuters\n\nNow chair of BT, Crozier left Royal Mail in 2010 to run ITV, leaving in 2017.\nThe ITV drama did not feature him and he has so far only issued a short\nstatement, stating his \u201cheartfelt sympathies to the individuals and families\nwho were so wronged by the tragic miscarriages of justice\u201d.\n\nHe will be followed in the coming weeks by former directors of the Post Office\nincluding Paula Vennells, who will be grilled about why the state-owned body\nwrongly prosecuted hundreds of people.\n\nPost office operators suffered bankruptcy, prison sentences and homelessness\nafter they were prosecuted for theft and false accounting in what MPs have\ndescribed as the worst miscarriage of justice in British legal history.\n\nThe Post Office hounded operators for more than a decade, alleging that they\nwere to blame for accounting shortfalls in their branch accounts. It has since\nemerged that the Post Office\u2019s Horizon computer system, which was developed by\nthe Japanese IT company Fujitsu, suffered from IT bugs and its accounting data\nwas unreliable.\n\nIn its latest hearings, the inquiry is set to question senior former Post\nOffice and Royal Mail executives under oath, many of whom are speaking for the\nfirst time about the scandal.\n\nAlan Cook, the former managing director of Post Office who went on to chair\nthe insurer Liverpool Victoria, will also appear on Friday. Allan Leighton,\nthe ex-chief executive of Asda who was a former chair of Royal Mail between\n2002 and 2009, will testify later this month.\n\nPaula Vennells, who was chief executive of the Post Office between 2012 and\n2019, will be grilled for three days next month.\n\nThe inquiry, chaired by the retired judge Sir Wyn Williams, began in 2022.\n\nIn its most recent set of hearings, which ended in February, it emerged that\nFujitsu had identified IT bugs in Horizon back in 1999. Fujitsu\u2019s Europe\nchief, Paul Patterson, told the inquiry that he found it \u201cshameful and\nappalling\u201d that criminal courts hearing the prosecutions had not been told of\nthe IT problems.\n\nMore than 900 post office operators were convicted in the courts using IT\nevidence from the Horizon computer system, including 700 convictions secured\nby the Post Office between 1999 and 2015.\n\n103 convictions have been overturned so far and legislation is being\nintroduced by the government to exonerate post office operators prosecuted\nbetween September 1996 and December 2018.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

In 2015 Vennells continued to deny to\nparliament that remote access was possible.\n\nLiam Byrne, Labour MP and chair of the business and trade select committee,\nsaid he was considering all options \u201cincluding the Commons exercising its\npowers in relation to contempt of parliament\u201d although he did not want to\njeopardise future legal action.\n\nThe Post Office said of the tapes: \u201cWe remain fully focused on getting to the\ntruth of what happened and supporting the statutory public inquiry.\u201d\n\nVennells said in a statement: \u201cI continue to support and focus on co-operating\nwith the inquiry and expect to be giving evidence in the coming months.\n\n\u201cI am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their\nfamilies, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly\nprosecuted as a result of the Horizon system.\n\n\u201cI now intend to continue to focus on assisting the inquiry and will not make\nany further public comment until it has concluded.\u201d\n\nTim Parker, who chaired the Post Office between 2015 and 2022, will be\nquestioned for two days in July.\n\nSir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats and postal affairs minister\nbetween 2010 and 2012, will appear in July along with the Lib Dem former\nbusiness secretary Sir Vince Cable.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Post Office Horizon scandal\n  * Royal Mail\n  * Post Office\n  * Adam Crozier\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Post Office had flawed court defence, leaked internal report shows\n\n29 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Ministers introduce bill to quash convictions of Horizon scandal victims\n\n13 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### What is the Post Office Horizon bill and why is it controversial?\n\n13 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Ministers to quash convictions of hundreds of post office operators\n\n13 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Post Office \u2018unfit\u2019 to run compensation scheme for Horizon victims, MPs say\n\n7 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Many victims of Post Office scandal risk missing out on payouts, MPs warn\n\n6 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### It\u2019s Kemi Badenoch v the Post Office, the show where ministers sweep everything under the carpet\n\n6 Mar 2024\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Horizon scandal victim uses Brits appearance to urge faster compensation\n\n2 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Former Post Office chair claims he is victim of \u2018smear campaign\u2019 led by Kemi Badenoch\n\n27 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Alan Bates sees \u2018no end\u2019 to Post Office scandal as payout targets missed\n\n27 Feb 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
