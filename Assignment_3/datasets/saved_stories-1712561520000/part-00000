DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2024.02.035\n\nDisturbed gut flora during the first years of life is associated with\ndiagnoses such as autism and ADHD later in life. This is according to a study\nled by researchers at the University of Florida and Link\u00f6ping University and\npublished in the journal Cell.\n\nThe study is the first forward-looking, or prospective, study to examine gut\nflora composition and a large variety of other factors in infants, in relation\nto the development of the children's nervous system. The researchers have\nfound many biological markers that seem to be associated with future\nneurological development disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, ADHD,\ncommunication disorder and intellectual disability.\n\n\"The remarkable aspect of the work is that these biomarkers are found at birth\nin cord blood or in the child's stool at one year of age over a decade prior\nto the diagnosis,\" says Eric W Triplett, professor at the Department of\nMicrobiology and Cell Science at the University of Florida, U.S., one of the\nresearchers who led the study.\n\nThe study is part of the ABIS (All Babies in Southeast Sweden) study led by\nJohnny Ludvigsson at Link\u00f6ping University. More than 16,000 children born in\n1997\u20131999, representing the general population, have been followed from birth\ninto their twenties. Of these, 1,197 children, corresponding to 7.3%, have\nbeen diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, communication disorder or\nintellectual disability.\n\nA large number of lifestyle and environmental factors have been identified\nthrough surveys conducted on several occasions during the children's\nupbringing. For some of the children, the researchers have analyzed substances\nin umbilical cord blood and bacteria in their stool at the age of 1.\n\n\"We can see in the study that there are clear differences in the intestinal\nflora already during the first year of life between those who develop autism\nor ADHD and those who don't. We've found associations with some factors that\naffect gut bacteria, such as antibiotic treatment during the child's first\nyear, which is linked to an increased risk of these diseases,\" says\nLudvigsson, senior professor at the Department of Biomedical and Clinical\nSciences at Link\u00f6ping University, who led the study together with Triplett.\n\nChildren who had repeated ear infections during their first year of life had\nan increased risk of being diagnosed with a developmental neurological\ndisorder later in life. It is probably not the infection itself that is the\nculprit, but the researchers suspect a link to antibiotic treatment. They\nfound that the presence of Citrobacter bacteria or the absence of Coprococcus\nbacteria increased the risk of future diagnosis.\n\nOne possible explanation may be that antibiotic treatment has disturbed the\ncomposition of the gut flora in a way that contributes to neurodevelopmental\ndisorders. The risk of antibiotic treatment damaging the gut flora and\nincreasing the risk of diseases linked to the immune system, such as type 1\ndiabetes and childhood rheumatism, has been shown in previous studies.\n\n\"Coprococcus and Akkermansia muciniphila have potential protective effects.\nThese bacteria were correlated with important substances in the stool, such as\nvitamin B and precursors to neurotransmitters which play vital roles\norchestrating signaling in the brain. Overall, we saw deficits in these\nbacteria in children who later received a developmental neurological\ndiagnosis,\" says Angelica Ahrens, Assistant Scientist in Triplett's research\ngroup at the University of Florida and the first author of this study.\n\nThe present study also confirms that the risk of developmental neurological\ndiagnosis in the child increases if the parents smoke. Conversely,\nbreastfeeding has a protective effect, according to the study.\n\nIn cord blood taken at the birth of children, the researchers analyzed the\namounts of various substances from the body's metabolism, such as fatty acids\nand amino acids. They also measured some harmful substances that come from\noutside, such as nicotine and environmental toxins. They compared substances\nin the umbilical cord blood of 27 children diagnosed with autism with the same\nnumber of children without a diagnosis.\n\nIt turned out that children who were later diagnosed had low levels of several\nimportant fats in the umbilical cord blood. One of these was linolenic acid,\nwhich is needed for the formation of omega 3 fatty acids that are anti-\ninflammatory and have several other effects in the brain.\n\nThe same group also had higher levels than the control group of a PFAS\nsubstance, a group of substances used as flame retardants and shown to\nnegatively affect the immune system in several different ways. PFAS substances\ncan enter the body via drinking water, food and the air we breathe.\n\nIt is not certain that the relationships that the research team found in the\nSwedish children can be generalized to other populations, but these issues\nneed to be studied in other groups as well. Another question is whether gut\nflora imbalance is a triggering factor or whether it has occurred as a result\nof underlying factors, such as diet or antibiotics.\n\nHowever, even when the researchers accounted for risk factors that might\naffect the gut flora, they found that the link between future diagnosis\nremained for many of the bacteria. This indicates that some of the differences\nin gut flora between children with and without future diagnosis are not\nexplained by such risk factors.\n\nThe research is at an early stage and more studies are needed, but the\ndiscovery that many biomarkers for future developmental neurological disorders\ncan be observed at an early age opens up the possibility of developing\nscreening protocols and preventive measures in the long term.\n\nMore information: Angelica P.
