That could dramatically shorten the\nlife of the plane, he warned, potentially causing it to break apart in mid-\nflight.\n\n\"I'm doing this not because I want Boeing to fail, but because I want it to\nsucceed, and prevent crashes from happening,\" Salehpour said. \"The truth is,\nBoeing can't keep going the way it is. It needs to do a little bit better, I\nthink.\"\n\n### Business\n\n### How bad is Boeing's 2024 so far? Here's a timeline\n\nBoeing disputes Salehpour's claims, calling them \"inaccurate\" and saying the\ncompany is \"fully confident\" in the 787.\n\nSalehpour joins a growing list of current and former Boeing employees who say\nthe company has ignored their concerns \u2014 and then retaliated against them when\nthey spoke up. The company denies that, but aviation experts say Boeing needs\nto do a better job of listening to its employees.\n\nThe latest allegations come as Boeing is struggling to rebuild trust with\nairlines and the public after a door plug panel blew out in midair from a 737\nMax 9 in January.\n\nThat incident has already forced CEO Dave Calhoun to announce he will depart\nat the end of the year. And it prompted the company's Chief Financial Officer,\nBrian West, to acknowledge that Boeing has made mistakes.\n\n\"For years, we prioritized the movement of the airplane through the factory\nover getting it done right. And that's got to change,\" West said at an\ninvestor conference last month. Boeing's leaders also need to do a better job\nof listening to its workforce, he said.\n\nBoeing 787 Dreamliner fuselages during production at the company's\nmanufacturing facility in North Charleston, S.C. in 2022.

Retaliation is strictly prohibited\nat Boeing.\"\n\nBut independent experts charged with evaluating the company's safety practices\nsay that's not how many Boeing employees see it.\n\n\"You cannot have a safety culture where the people that are doing the work\ndon't believe what they're hearing,\" said Javier de Luis, a lecturer in the\nDepartment of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology.\n\n### Business\n\n### As the DOJ investigates Boeing, crash victims' families wonder why it's\ntaken so long\n\nDe Luis's sister Graziella died in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302\nin 2019. De Luis served on an expert panel convened by the Federal Aviation\nAdministration after the crash of that Boeing 737 Max 8 jet, and another one\nthe year before, that killed 346 people in total.\n\nDe Luis says the panel found a \"disconnect\" between Boeing's management and\nthe factory floor.\n\n\"It's one thing to hear, 'yes, speak up if you see anything wrong.' And then\nyou go and talk to the folks that are doing the work. And they say, 'yeah, but\nmy buddy spoke up and next thing he knew, he was being transferred out, or\nbeing given write ups for minor things,'\" de Luis said.\n\n### Other whistleblowers say they faced retaliation\n\nFormer Boeing mechanic Davin Fischer says he spoke up \u2014 and paid a steep price\nfor it.\n\nFischer worked for Boeing as a mechanic at the factory in Renton, Wash. where\nthe company builds the 737 Max. He says Boeing's leaders were constantly\npushing to speed up production.\n\n\"Hey, we need to go faster, faster, faster,\" Fischer said. \"They cared more\nabout shareholders and investors than they did planes, their employees,\nanything.\"\n\nWhen Fischer finally pushed back, he says he was demoted in retaliation, and\nthen fired from the company in 2019. Fischer says many of his friends who\nstill work at Boeing are afraid to speak out.\n\n\"People there are scared, a hundred percent,\" he said. \"Because they don't\nwant to get fired.\"\n\nThere's also the example of John Barnett, a longtime quality manager who blew\nthe whistle on Boeing in 2019, alleging that the company was covering up\nserious defects with the 787 Dreamliner.\n\n### National\n\n### Boeing whistleblower John Barnett, who raised alarm over plane quality, is\nfound dead\n\n### Business\n\n### Crash Victim's Family Pushes To Keep Boeing 737 Max From Flying Again Too\nSoon\n\n\"I'm not gonna lie, it's been rough on me. It's been rough on my family. I'm\nstill dealing with issues. I'm still having anxiety attacks, PTSD,\" Barnett\nsaid in a 2019 interview with Ralph Nader. (Nader's grandniece, Samya Stumo,\nwas killed in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302).\n\nBarnett said his managers at Boeing retaliated against him by docking his pay\nand creating a hostile environment, eventually forcing him into early\nretirement.\n\n\"It's taken a serious mental and emotional toll on me. But you know, I want to\ntry very hard to keep the focus on the safety of the airplane. That's what my\nstory is about,\" Barnett said. \"It keeps me up at night. I can't sleep. It's\ntaken a heck of a toll on me.\"\n\nBarnett filed a complaint against Boeing for wrongful termination. On the\nthird day of depositions in that case last month, Barnett was found dead in\nhis truck of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to police in\nSouth Carolina.\n\n### Latest whistleblower says Boeing must account for its mistakes\n\nThe latest Boeing whistleblower, engineer Sam Salehpour, alleges that he faced\nretaliation as well. His lawyer, Debra Katz, says Salehpour brought his\nconcerns to managers repeatedly.\n\n\"Initially, he was just told to shut up. Then he was told he was a problem.\nThen he was excluded from meetings,\" Katz said. \"He was barred from speaking\nto structural engineers. He was barred from speaking to mathematicians and\nothers to help him understand the data. And at one point, his boss threatened\nhim with physical violence.\"\n\n### Business\n\n### FAA toughens oversight of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner\n\n### The Two-Way\n\n### Boeing 787 Dreamliner Is Safe, FAA Team Concludes\n\nKatz says Salehpour reported the threat to human resources. That's when Boeing\nmoved him from the 787 to a different plane. Still, Salehpour insists he's not\nangry.\n\n\"Despite the treatment and retaliation I have experienced in the company, I'm\nnot bitter,\" Salehpour told reporters this week. \"Boeing has to realize that\nimplementing a real safety culture moving forward also means accounting for,\nadmitting the mistakes and correcting the mistakes that have been made over 20\nyears.\"\n\nSalehpour will have another chance to share his story next week, when he's\nscheduled to testify before a Senate subcommittee on Wednesday.\n\nBoeing has been invited too, but it's more likely that someone from the\ncompany will testify at a later date.\n\n  * Whistleblower\n  * Boeing 737 Max\n  * Boeing 787\n  * Boeing\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n##### National\n\n#### Would you qualify for the jury on a Trump trial?
