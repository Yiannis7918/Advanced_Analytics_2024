The goal of this\ndocument is to provide a nearly comprehensive list of citations for those\ndeveloping and applying these approaches to experimental, phenomenological, or\ntheoretical analyses. As a living document, it will be updated as often as\npossible to incorporate the latest developments. A list of proper (unchanging)\nreviews can be found within. Papers are grouped into a small set of topics to\nbe as useful as possible. Suggestions are most welcome.\n\nExpand all sections Collapse all sections\n\n## Reviews\u00b6\n\n## Classification\u00b6\n\n## Regression\u00b6\n\n## Equivariant networks.\u00b6\n\n## Decorrelation methods.\u00b6\n\n## Generative models / density estimation\u00b6\n\n## Anomaly detection.\u00b6\n\n## Simulation-based (`likelihood-free') Inference\u00b6\n\n## Uncertainty Quantification\u00b6\n\n## Formal Theory and ML\u00b6\n\n## Experimental results.\u00b6\n\nThis section is incomplete as there are many results that directly and\nindirectly (e.g. via flavor tagging) use modern machine learning techniques.\nWe will try to highlight experimental results that use deep learning in a\ncritical way for the final analysis sensitivity.\n\nMade with Material for MkDocs\n\n", "frontpage": false}
