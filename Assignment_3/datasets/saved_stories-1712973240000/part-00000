This is an all-time\nhigh, surpassing the previous record of 320 shortages in 2014.\n\nAll drug classes are vulnerable to shortages. Some of the most worrying\nshortages involve generic sterile injectable medications, including cancer\nchemotherapy drugs and emergency medications stored in hospital crash carts\nand procedural areas. Ongoing national shortages of therapies for attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder also remain a serious challenge for clinicians\nand patients.\n\nFor more than two decades, ASHP has actively monitored drug shortages and\ndeveloped vital strategies that help our members minimize the effects of\nshortages on pharmacy operations and patient care. Managing drug shortages is\na critical component of ASHP\u2019s national meetings and in our educational\nprogramming.\n\nBut we all know that managing shortages isn\u2019t enough and is not a sustainable\nsolution to the worsening crisis. That\u2019s why ASHP has long prioritized\nadvocacy supporting solutions to reduce drug shortages.\n\nWe have built strong relationships with stakeholders outside of pharmacy who\nhave a role in ending drug shortages. ASHP was selected to be a member of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) Joint Supply Chain Working Group\nto advise HHS agencies on their response to drug and medical device shortages.\n\nASHP joined a White House-sponsored roundtable in July, along with\nmanufacturers, providers, and others, to discuss national shortages in key\ncancer medications and provide steps we believe the federal government could\ntake to expand availability and access to medications.\n\nASHP\u2019s Policy Solutions to Address the Drug Shortage Crisis, released last\nyear, provide specific guidance to Congress and regulators about actions they\ncan take to prevent shortages. ASHP also testified before the House Energy and\nCommerce Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Health, where we outlined our proposed\nsolutions to address generic drug shortages, and Congress incorporated several\nof our recommendations in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Recovery\nAct in 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s gratifying that several of our most recent recommendations are now being\nconsidered by policymakers in the White House, Congress, and HHS. However,\nASHP has serious concerns about HHS\u2019 proposed financial penalties for\nhospitals that lack the resources to stockpile medications and take other\nsuggested steps to mitigate shortages.\n\nMuch work remains to be done at the federal level to fix the root causes of\ndrug shortages. ASHP will continue to engage with policymakers regularly as we\nguide efforts to draft and pass new legislation to address drug shortages and\ncontinue to strongly advocate on behalf of our members for solutions that\nwork.\n\nIt\u2019s long past time to put an end to drug shortages.\n\nThank you for all you do for your patients and our profession.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPaul\n\nPosted on April 11, 2024\n\n  * Related ASHP Sites\n\n    * AJHP Journal\n    * AHFS Drug Information\n    * ASHP Connect\n    * ASHP Foundation\n    * ASHP Global\n    * ASHP eBooks\n    * ASHP Learning Center\n    * ASHP Well-being & You\n    * Pharmacy Technician Society\n    * SafeMedication.com\n\n  * Partner with ASHP\n\n    * Corporate Support Policy\n    * Business Opportunities\n    * Drug Database Licensing\n    * Advertising\n\n  * NEWS CENTER\n  * ASHP Careers\n  * Contact Us\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.
