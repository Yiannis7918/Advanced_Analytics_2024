Stewart\n\nMarch 12, 2012\n\nNew York tax laws don\u2019t apply to people who are deemed to be nonresidents,\neven if they own a residence here and work here.Illustration by Christoph\nNiemann\n\nA prerogative of being a billionaire is the freedom to go anywhere, anytime.\nFor decades, Julian H. Robertson, Jr., who founded Tiger Capital Management,\nin 1980, and turned an eight-million-dollar investment into a twenty-three-\nbillion-dollar company, has had a car and driver at his disposal. Robertson\nreturned capital to investors in 2000 but still runs Tiger as a private firm,\nand he remains the dean of American hedge-fund managers. He was recently named\nchairman of the private-equity firm Forstmann Little & Company, after the\ndeath of his close friend Theodore J. Forstmann. Forbes estimates Robertson\u2019s\nnet worth at $2.4 billion. And, in contrast to disgraced managers like Bernard\nMadoff or Samuel Israel, Robertson has a reputation for honesty. He \u201ccared\nabout integrity and reputation,\u201d Katherine Burton wrote in her 2007 book,\n\u201cHedge Hunters.\u201d \u201cRobertson focused on the ethics of corporate managers, their\nintelligence, and their integrity, both personal and in regard to their\ndedication to improving shareholder value.\u201d\n\nDuring a typical workweek, Robertson\u2019s driver would transport him from his\napartment on Central Park South to a ten-acre estate in Locust Valley, New\nYork, to a summer rental in Southampton, to several Long Island golf clubs,\nand to his Park Avenue headquarters. For travel to his vacation retreat in Sun\nValley, Idaho, to his estate in New Zealand, to golf outings in Ireland, and\nto other far-flung destinations, Robertson used a private plane that landed at\nand took off from Farmingdale, Long Island; Teterboro, New Jersey; and\nLaGuardia Airport. He could go where he liked, when he liked, but there was a\ncatch.\n\nSince New York City tax laws don\u2019t apply to people who are deemed to be\nnonresidents, even if they own a residence in the city and work there,\nRobertson was allowed to spend no more than half a year\u2014a hundred and eighty-\nthree days\u2014in New York City. This exile was self-imposed. If he had paid New\nYork City tax, which in the top bracket reaches a rate of 3.6 per cent of\ntaxable income, he could have spent as much time in the city as he wished. In\n1998 and 1999, when his wife, Josephine, was being treated for cancer in New\nYork City, that is what he did.\n\nBut in 2000 Robertson was determined to stay outside the city for at least a\nhundred and eighty-two days, and thereby avoid New York City income tax. As a\nNew York State Division of Tax Appeals tribunal subsequently put it, his focus\nintensified \u201cas the year progressed and the number of remaining available days\ndiminished.\u201d\n\nThis was nearly a full-time job. One of Robertson\u2019s assistants, Julie\nDepperschmidt, scheduled his appointments and maintained a contemporaneous\ncomputerized record of his whereabouts, carefully distinguishing between \u201cNYC\ndays\u201d and \u201cnon NYC days.\u201d Different colored boxes indicated confirmed and\nanticipated non-New York City days. Whenever the combined number fell below a\nhundred and eighty-three, she advised him to add more non-New York City days\nto his schedule. She said that she reminded him \u201cad nauseam\u201d about what he\nneeded to do to reach a hundred and eighty-two non-New York City days.\n\nFriday nights were particularly risky, since Robertson or his wife often had\nsocial events scheduled in the city. In order to \u201cearn a tax day,\u201d as he put\nit, he usually left town on Friday before midnight, even if his wife stayed at\nthe apartment. Robertson\u2019s driver had to be on alert: as long as they crossed\nthe Queens border en route to Locust Valley by midnight, Robertson didn\u2019t have\nto \u201cwaste\u201d a Saturday as a New York day. Even one minute of a day spent in the\ncity counts as a day of residence. (Exceptions are made for people who are in\ntransit from one destination outside the city to another\u2014from Newark airport\nto Long Island, for example, or to LaGuardia for a flight.) Robertson said he\nnever missed the midnight deadline, although when he couldn\u2019t get his driver\nor a limousine service in time he occasionally had to hail a cab. On one\noccasion, Robertson came back from a trip and found himself crossing into\nManhattan at 11:45 P.M. That mistake cost him a full New York City day, which\nhe could have avoided by whiling away fifteen minutes at the airport.\n\nAccording to Depperschmidt\u2019s meticulous calculations, by the end of the\ncalendar year 2000 Robertson had recorded a hundred and eighty-three New York\nCity days, the exact number allowed by statute, and a number all but\nguaranteed to raise red flags, because it came so close to the line. Most\npeople declaring nonresident status on their tax returns make sure to fall at\nleast a week or so short, in order to minimize the chance of an audit. The\nRobertsons filed a New York State tax return claiming they were nonresidents\nof New York City that year, and the Division of Taxation launched what turned\ninto a ten-year quest to collect New York City taxes.\n\nIn September of 2006, five years after the return was filed, the Division of\nTaxation announced its initial findings: Robertson had been outside the city\non a hundred and seventy-nine days, meaning that there were just four days in\ndispute. Robertson appealed, and the case wound its way through the courts for\nfour years. If he failed to demonstrate by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d\nthat he hadn\u2019t been in the city on even one of the disputed days, he would be\ndeemed a resident and would owe New York City income tax for the year 2000. In\nhis case, the sum amounted to $26,702,341, plus interest, which, given the New\nYork City tax rate, suggests that Robertson had taxable income that year of\nseven hundred and thirty-two million dollars.\n\nTax rates on the rich have become a highly charged political issue. Warren\nBuffett helped launch a national debate last year when he disclosed, in a\nTimes Op-Ed piece, that staff members working in his office paid a higher\nfederal-tax rate than he did. (One of them was his secretary Debbie Bosanek.)\nHe revealed that, on a taxable income of $39.8 million, he paid tax at a rate\nof 17.4 per cent. (Since taxable income is what\u2019s left after deductions, his\npercentage of adjusted gross income was no doubt even lower.) Mitt Romney,\nafter resisting making his tax returns public, revealed that he paid 13.9 per\ncent of his 2010 adjusted gross income of $21.6 million in federal tax. Some\nof the wealthiest people in the country pay even less.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service discloses detailed statistics for the four\nhundred highest-earning taxpayers in the country. In 2008, the most recent\nyear available, those taxpayers had an average adjusted gross income of two\nhundred and seventy million dollars each. Thirty of them paid less than ten\nper cent in federal taxes, and a hundred and one paid between ten and fifteen\nper cent. On average, the group paid 18.1 per cent\u2014a lower rate than taxpayers\nwho earn between two hundred thousand and five hundred thousand dollars.\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nPresident Obama has seized on that fact, making tax fairness a central issue\nin his re\u00eblection bid. The President has called for comprehensive tax reform\nand for specific proposals for a \u201cBuffett Rule,\u201d which would raise tax rates\non taxpayers earning more than a million dollars a year and end favorable tax\ntreatment for dividend income and so-called \u201ccarried interest\u201d earned by\nhedge-fund and private-equity managers.\n\n\u201cDo you know how much I love you?\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\nRepublicans don\u2019t defend the current tax code, either. Even a flat tax,\nwhereby taxpayers at all income levels pay the same rate\u2014a concept embraced in\nvarying degrees by some candidates and advanced by the conservative Heritage\nFoundation\u2014would likely raise rates on the ultra-wealthy. Romney has called\nfor a twenty-per-cent across-the-board tax cut, while limiting some\ndeductions. His plan was attacked by Rick Santorum as a disguised attempt to\nsoak the rich. And most Republicans have insisted that any reform be revenue\nneutral and not a tax increase.\n\nNone of the proposals address the fact that rich people aren\u2019t taxed on\ncertain income, either because it is exempt, as with interest on municipal\nbonds, or because they claim to be living outside the jurisdiction that is\nlevying the tax. Relatively scant media attention has been paid to residency\nrequirements, even though enormous revenue is at stake, as the Robertson case\ndemonstrates. Tax audits and hearings are ordinarily confidential, but several\npublished opinions, including the one eventually issued in Robertson\u2019s case,\nand related appeals reveal how some New Yorkers take advantage of the\nresidency requirement.\n\nMany states have such requirements. Relatively few cities levy personal income\ntaxes, but the largest ones that do, besides New York City, are Baltimore,\nCleveland, Denver, Detroit, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Portland, San Francisco,\nand St. Louis. The problem is especially acute for cities like New York, which\nare geographically close to nearby lower-tax jurisdictions.\n\nPeople who want to avoid both New York State and New York City income taxes\n(not to mention additional levies on the self-employed, such as the New York\nCity unincorporated-business tax) are permitted to own a residence and work in\nthe city and the state but must maintain a primary residence outside the\nstate\u2014hence the popularity of communities like Greenwich and New Canaan,\nConnecticut, or Summit, New Jersey.\n\nThe United States imposes federal-tax liability on the worldwide income of any\nforeign citizen who owns or has a permanent residence in the United States and\nis in the country for more than a hundred and eighty-two days (one day less\nthan is allowed by New York). This may explain the sale, in December of last\nyear, of the penthouse apartment of the former Citigroup chairman Sanford\nWeill, at 15 Central Park West, for a record eighty-eight million dollars, to\nEkaterina Rybolovleva, a twenty-two-year-old university student, rather than\nto her father, the Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. For similar reasons,\nmany purchases are in the names of trusts or corporations. But tax liability\nhasn\u2019t stopped other Russians from buying property in the United States. In\nthe past three years, five Russians paid more than ten million dollars each\nfor houses in Aspen, and one paid $25.5 million for a place near Miami Beach,\naccording to Bloomberg News. The richest man in the world, the Mexican\nbillionaire Carlos Slim, paid forty-four million dollars for a Manhattan town\nhouse. These buyers may have little cause for concern: the I.R.S. spends few\nresources tracking their whereabouts, and tax experts say that there has never\nbeen a reported case in which the I.R.S. alleged that a foreign property owner\noverstayed the limit.\n\nThe residency loophole provides an obvious financial motive to lie. One\nprominent tax lawyer told me that \u201ccheating is rampant.\u201d According to New York\nState tax authorities, nonresidents pay about $4.7 billion a year in state\ntaxes. The state audits approximately four thousand of these returns, and\nbrings in about two hundred million dollars a year in delinquencies from\npeople wrongly or fraudulently claiming nonresident status. New York\nnonresident tax returns ask taxpayers to check a box if they maintain a\npermanent residence in New York State or City. \u201cOf course, we have no way of\nknowing how many people don\u2019t check the box who should,\u201d Robert Plattner, the\ndeputy commissioner for tax policy, told me.\n\nMost people who pay New York City income tax neither own nor can afford second\nor third homes that enable them to choose a lower tax residency while still\nenjoying all the benefits of living, working, doing business, earning income,\nand owning property in New York. Even if they did have the means, they\u2019d be\nhard pressed to meet the hundred-and-eighty-three-day maximum, since most have\njobs in the city that require them to be there more than half the year.\n\nThis limits the benefits of the policy to those with the flexibility or the\npower to dictate their working conditions\u2014people like the prominent criminal-\ndefense lawyer Thomas Puccio, perhaps best known for his successful defense of\nthe socialite Claus von B\u00fclow, who was charged with murdering his comatose\nwife, Martha (Sunny) von B\u00fclow, in 1982. Puccio and his wife had a co-op\napartment at 10 East Eighty-first Street. For 2003, he claimed that their\nprimary residence was in Weston, Connecticut, and that he had spent only a\nhundred and fifteen days in New York State and City, thus qualifying as a\nnonresident. The Tax Division launched an audit and concluded that Puccio had\ndemonstrated he was outside New York for eighty days. Puccio conceded that he\nhad been in New York for a hundred and eleven days, leaving a hundred and\nseventy-four days in dispute.\n\nUnlike Robertson, Puccio made little systematic effort to document his\nwhereabouts. He relied largely on credit-card statements, travel records,\ndocket entries for cases in which he appeared, and FedEx and E-ZPass toll\ncharges. Puccio said that he was in Connecticut from January 13th to January\n16th\u2014four non-New York days. On January 13th, a Monday, his credit-card\nstatement reflected a charge at a Westport, Connecticut, restaurant. But two\ndays later the statement showed a charge of $201.19 at a New York City\nrestaurant. Puccio testified that the restaurant kept his card on file and\ncharged a quarterly minimum whether or not he was present.\n\nPuccio conceded that he was in New York City on January 28th, 30th, and 31st.\nBut he claimed that he was in Connecticut on Wednesday, January 29th. He\ntestified that he never used cash, and, since there were no New York City\ncharges, he must have been in Connecticut\u2014even though there were no\nConnecticut charges, either.\n\nThe pattern continued throughout the year. If a charge appeared at a\nConnecticut establishment, it meant that Puccio was in Connecticut. If it was\nin New York, someone else had used his account\u2014perhaps his housekeeper or his\nassistant. On February 18th, there were credit-card charges for a restaurant\nin New York City and a delivery fee from Bloomingdale\u2019s. Puccio said that he\nmade \u201can assumption\u201d that his wife had ordered something over the phone from\nthe department store and that the restaurant often delivered food to his\napartment for cleaning personnel or, sometimes, for his assistant.\n\nPuccio often relied on court-docket entries as evidence that he was away from\nthe city representing defendants. He stated that on January 16th he was in\nStamford for a case. The court docket indicated that a memorandum of decision\nwas filed that day, but there was no indication of any appearances by counsel.\nThat same day, there was a charge from a New York City restaurant to Puccio\u2019s\ncredit card.\n\nPuccio said that he spent July 27th through July 31st in Philadelphia, where\nhe represented a defendant at trial in federal court. The docket indicated\nthat he was one of two attorneys representing the defendant, and that there\nwere trial proceedings from July 28th through the 31st. However, there was no\nindication that Puccio was present. There was a credit-card charge at a New\nYork City restaurant on July 30th.\n\n\u201cYou look just like your profile picture.\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\nPuccio knew that his testimony was under oath and was subject to penalties of\nperjury. Much of his testimony was vague: he had \u201cno reason to believe\u201d he was\nin New York on a particular day; he \u201cassumed\u201d he wasn\u2019t in New York. But the\ncourt appearances would seem to lend themselves to definitive proof.\nPresumably, the transcript of the proceedings in federal court in Philadelphia\nwould establish whether Puccio was present, as would the testimony of his co-\ncounsel. So would billing records in the various cases. But Puccio produced no\nsuch evidence. In tax-residency cases, the burden is on the taxpayer to\nestablish his whereabouts, so the Tax Division didn\u2019t check the transcripts or\nproduce them as evidence. Nor did the Tax Division or Puccio identify the\nparties to the case, so it\u2019s impossible to independently check who was present\nin the courtroom. (Puccio did not respond to messages left at his law office.)\n\nSimilarly, when attributing charges to his former law partner or to his law\nassistant, Puccio could have offered their corroborating testimony or\naffidavits. \u201cUnder the circumstances, it is reasonable to take the strongest\npossible negative inference from [Puccio\u2019s] failure to provide supporting\nevidence,\u201d the administrative law judge, Thomas C. Sacca, admonished, in\neffect dismissing much of Puccio\u2019s testimony as unreliable, if not false. Last\nyear, Judge Sacca, after examining the evidence for all hundred and seventy-\nfour disputed days, ruled that Puccio had been in New York on a hundred and\nnine of those days, for a total of two hundred and twenty days for the\ncalendar year 2003\u2014far exceeding the hundred-and-eighty-three-day maximum.\nPuccio therefore owed $271,382 in New York State and City personal income tax,\nplus interest and penalties.\n\nAnother notable case involved Martha Stewart. Long before she was convicted,\nin 2004, of obstructing justice and making false statements in an insider-\ntrading investigation, Stewart claimed to be a nonresident New York taxpayer\nwho lived on Turkey Hill Road South, in Westport, Connecticut, the site of\nmany photo spreads in Martha Stewart Living. Although she conceded that she\nowned a large, shingled house and a guest cottage on Lily Pond Lane, in East\nHampton, New York, and an apartment in Manhattan, she claimed that neither was\na \u201cpermanent place of abode\u201d as defined by the tax law, because both were\nundergoing extensive renovations and were uninhabitable during the years in\nquestion, 1991 and 1992.\n\nFor someone whose comings and goings were chronicled exhaustively, it\u2019s\nsurprising that evidence of her whereabouts on any given day proved so\nelusive. Like Puccio, Stewart relied on credit-card charges, travel documents,\nand limousine receipts to prove her presence outside New York. But similar\ncharges and documents generated in New York were inconclusive, she argued,\nbecause others used her car and driver, and her card was on file at many New\nYork establishments. Daily itineraries indicating her presence in New York\nwere also unreliable, because she often deviated from the written schedule.\nShe testified that she rarely came to New York, because most of her friends\nlived in Greenwich, and that she never spent more than a day or two in East\nHampton, and generally worked from her home in Westport.\n\nStewart also testified \u201cemphatically,\u201d according to Judge Sacca, who presided\nat Stewart\u2019s hearing, that she hadn\u2019t appeared as a paid guest on the \u201cToday\u201d\nshow, which is broadcast from NBC\u2019s Rockefeller Center studios, during the\nrelevant year. But issues of Martha Stewart Living touted her frequent \u201cToday\u201d\nappearances. When confronted with the evidence, Stewart said that some\nepisodes, such as the Thanksgiving and Christmas segments, were taped on\nlocation, at her home in Connecticut. She introduced no supporting evidence to\nthat effect.\n\nIt should have been easy to resolve how often Stewart appeared in the \u201cToday\u201d\nshow studio in a given year by consulting NBC\u2019s archives. Instead, her lawyers\nsubsequently recanted her testimony about the \u201cToday\u201d show and dropped the\nclaim that she hadn\u2019t been in the New York studio. Judge Sacca cited this as\n\u201canother example of the lack of credible testimony\u201d in her case.\n\nStewart\u2019s hearing wasn\u2019t until October, 1998, seven years after the events,\nand Judge Sacca pointed to the \u201cdifficulty inherent in relying solely upon an\nindividual\u2019s memory,\u201d suggesting that she may have been mistaken or had\nforgotten rather than that she was lying about her whereabouts.\n\nThen there was the New York State tax issue of whether Stewart maintained a\n\u201cpermanent place of abode\u201d in the state for \u201csubstantially all\u201d of a given tax\nyear. The auditor agreed that her Manhattan apartment was undergoing\nrenovation throughout 1992. Stewart claimed that the East Hampton house was\nalso being renovated and was uninhabitable in 1992, and submitted invoices\ndating from 1990 and 1991 indicating that she spent $1.3 million on the\nproperty. She testified that renovations continued throughout 1992, and that\nthe kitchen wasn\u2019t finished.\n\nBut the Town of East Hampton issued a certificate of occupancy in 1991, and in\na questionnaire that she signed before a notary Stewart said she moved into\nthe house during the summer of 1991. Jacket copy for books she published in\n1991 and 1992 stated that \u201cMrs. Stewart lives in Connecticut and New York, and\nis presently creating a new garden on Long Island\u201d; and \u201cMrs. Stewart lives in\nConnecticut in a Federal farmhouse and on Long Island in a shingled Queen\nAnne-style house she has recently restored and renovated.\u201d In the\nNovember/December, 1991, issue of her magazine, Stewart referred to \u201cmy new\nhome by the seashore, a shingled rambler with numerous mantels, polished fir\nfloors, and white walls and woodwork.\u201d Accompanying photographs suggested that\nthe \u201cproperty was habitable and furnished, and . . . in use as a residence,\u201d\naccording to Judge Sacca. (For another photo shoot, Stewart had claimed that\nfurniture was brought in temporarily.) Another issue featured a six-page photo\nspread and article on the adjacent cottage, indicating that her daughter,\nAlexis, lived there. Judge Sacca concluded that the cottage appeared to be\n\u201cwell furnished and \u2018lived-in,\u2019 \u201d notwithstanding Stewart\u2019s testimony that it\nwas uninhabitable and her daughter had to rent an apartment while in East\nHampton.\n\nBeginning in July, 1991, Stewart subscribed to cable TV at the Lily Pond Lane\naddress. Asked about this, she said that workmen needed to have cable\ninstalled in order to test the home\u2019s stereo and audiovisual system. Judge\nSacca wondered why it was necessary to subscribe to \u201cFamily Plus Cable, HBO,\nShowtime, Disney, MSG and Sports Channel\u201d simply to test the audiovisual\nsystem. He ruled that Stewart \u201cfailed to establish by clear and convincing\nevidence that she did not maintain a permanent place of abode in New York\nState for substantially all of 1992,\u201d and affirmed a tax deficiency of\n$221,677.82, plus penalties and interest. (A publicist said that Stewart\nwouldn\u2019t comment on the tax cases or her testimony.)\n\nNeither Puccio nor Stewart was accused of making any false statements or was\nreferred to any other agency for further investigation. According to New York\ntax authorities, people are rarely charged with perjury or making false\nstatements in a residency audit. \u201cOur job is to collect revenue and administer\nthe tax laws,\u201d Dan Smirlock, a former New York deputy tax commissioner, said.\n\u201cWe do a lot of criminal referrals for tax evasion to district attorneys. But\nfor perjury the proof is so difficult. It doesn\u2019t seem to be a high priority.\u201d\n\nLike the residency requirement, many provisions in the existing tax laws\nprovide breaks that only the very wealthy can take advantage of. Although the\ntop four hundred taxpayers account for only a sliver of all taxpayers, I.R.S.\ndata show that they collect almost five per cent of total dividend income\nreported by all taxpayers. They reap an even bigger percentage of total\ncapital gains\u2014thirteen per cent, according to the I.R.S. Powerful interests\nsupport the status quo, and have lobbied heavily to preserve such breaks,\narguing that, even if they do benefit the wealthy, they also promote\ninvestment and help support the broad economy.\n\nBut the argument for residency exemptions has rested almost entirely on\nappeals to fairness: that nonresidents shouldn\u2019t have to pay for services that\nthey aren\u2019t physically present to take advantage of. That proposition is\nhardly self-evident. \u201cWe provide the environment for you to make money,\u201d\nSmirlock told me. \u201cWe protect your earnings. We keep thieves off the street.\nWe collect your garbage. You get your electricity.\u201d He might also have added\nthat those services enhance the value of the real estate that nonresidents own\nand profit from, even if they\u2019re not spending much time in New York.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind being referred to as a stay-at-home with crazy amounts of\nhelp, do you?\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\nAll of which raises the question: Why exempt anyone who works and earns money\nin New York City, even if he\u2019s physically present fewer than a hundred and\neighty-three days? Why not tax people who make their income at Manhattan-based\nhedge funds, no matter how many days they spend in the city? Such a policy\nwould eliminate the need for compulsive day-counting, not to mention the\nbureaucracy and costs necessary to document it, as well as the incentive for\ncheating. Fred Feingold, whose Manhattan law firm, Feingold & Alpert,\nspecializes in complex tax matters and has represented Julian Robertson, among\nothers, said, \u201cIt takes a significant amount of time for an assistant to keep\nthe records.\u201d\n\nThere once was such a law. People who worked in New York City were subject to\nNew York City tax on what they earned in the city no matter how many days they\nspent there. New York City taxes are set by the state Legislature, and\nsuburban lawmakers, many of whose constituents commute and are major campaign\ndonors, lobbied to repeal the tax for nonresidents and succeeded in 1999, over\nthe vehement protests of city officials. Periodic efforts to restore the tax\nhave failed. Powerful New York City real-estate interests have opposed any\nchanges, arguing that it would hurt demand for apartments and second homes in\nthe city. And wealthy bankers and hedge-fund managers have threatened to move\ntheir offices out of New York. None of these arguments have any bearing on the\nfairness of the existing tax policy.\n\nAlthough Feingold has represented scores of clients accused of misstating\ntheir residency status, he is ambivalent about the provision. The existing law\nencourages people to own real estate in New York and to spend time and money\nthere. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to chase people away,\u201d he said. On the other hand,\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, it\u2019s only the rich who can afford New York City pieds-\u00e0-\nterre.\u201d\n\nIn Julian Robertson\u2019s case, with nearly twenty-seven million dollars in tax\nrevenue at stake, Robertson had to show that he was outside New York City for\nall of the four disputed days in 2000: April 15th, July 23rd, July 31st, and\nNovember 16th. April 15th looked promising to the Tax Division. But Robertson,\nwho valued his reputation for probity, was determined to prevail. On Thursday,\nApril 13th, Josephine Robertson had flown back to New York City after visiting\nher mother in San Antonio. She met Robertson and they spent the evening\ntogether. She spent Friday night there, and joined Robertson for a round of\ngolf at Deepdale Golf Club, on Long Island, on Saturday. Robertson said he\u2019d\nleft the city on Friday and spent the night in Locust Valley before meeting\nhis wife at the club the next day, but he had no proof. The Tax Division\nargued that it was implausible that Robertson would have left his wife alone\nin the city on a Friday night simply to avoid triggering a New York City tax\nday.\n\nRobertson testified that he had indeed left on Friday. Josephine added that\nshe was \u201chappy\u201d to have him \u201cout of her hair\u201d while she packed for an extended\ntrip to Australia. And Robertson said he always left New York City on Friday\nif he planned to spend the weekend in Locust Valley. Had he not done so on\nApril 14th, it would have been the only such instance during the year.\n\nOn July 23rd, Robertson and a group that included his sons Spencer and Alex\nand his friend Payson Coleman returned from a golf outing in Ireland, landing\nat 9:15 P.M. at LaGuardia Airport. The next morning, Robertson was at work in\nManhattan, and the Tax Division argued it was implausible that Robertson would\nhave gone from LaGuardia to Locust Valley and then back to Manhattan early the\nnext morning, rather than simply joining his wife at the Manhattan apartment.\nBut Coleman testified that he shared a ride from the airport to Locust Valley\nwith Robertson, and a phone call to Robertson\u2019s car at 6:59 A.M. the next day\nsuggests that he was en route to Manhattan.\n\nOn July 31st, Robertson\u2019s calendar indicated an \u201cinvestment staff meeting\u201d at\nTiger Management headquarters, in Manhattan. But it was the third day (and\nfirst weekday) of Robertson\u2019s annual summer stay in Southampton. Phone records\nshowed several lengthy calls between Robertson\u2019s summer house and the\nManhattan office, and he testified that he had communicated with the office by\nphone.\n\nOn November 16th, a Thursday, Robertson was being honored by the University of\nVirginia at the dedication of the Julian Robertson Capital Markets trading\nroom, on the campus in Charlottesville. He and Josephine and several friends\nflew in his plane from LaGuardia, leaving at 2:20 P.M. The Tax Division\ncontended that Robertson must have spent the previous night, November 15th, at\nhis Manhattan apartment with his wife. But he testified that he\u2019d left New\nYork City and spent the night in Locust Valley, in order to avoid adding a tax\nday. He had no proof of his whereabouts. Two of his companions\u2014both were\nemployees of Tiger Management who considered Robertson a mentor\u2014buttressed his\ntestimony by recalling that Mrs. Robertson arrived at the airport first, in a\nhired car, and that Robertson followed, in a separate car, suggesting that\nthey had embarked from different locations.\n\nThe precise burden of proof in such cases, usually referred to as \u201cclear and\nconvincing\u201d evidence, remains notoriously inexact. But, in sharp contrast to\nthe situations in the Puccio and the Stewart cases, Robertson\u2019s reputation for\nintegrity and the care with which he reported his locations weighed\nconsiderably. The judges noted that on at least two occasions\u2014once when\nRobertson crossed into Manhattan at 11:45 P.M., and once when he left\nSouthampton for a previously unscheduled medical visit in New York City and\nreturned the same day\u2014he instructed Julie Depperschmidt to record the days as\nNew York City days, even though there was no way that she would have known\nthat he was in the city, and little likelihood that the tax authorities would\nhave, either. \u201cAt a minimum these circumstances, confirmed by Depperschmidt in\ntestimony, speak to the integrity and regularity of the process by which\npetitioner sought to track and account for his days within and without New\nYork City,\u201d the tribunal noted.\n\nIn a divided opinion, issued in September, 2010, the tribunal reversed the\nfinding of a tax deficiency and ruled for Robertson on all four days. \u201cIt is,\nof course, possible\u201d that Robertson \u201cwas physically present in New York City\non any (or all) of the four disputed days,\u201d the administrative law judge had\nsaid in his earlier opinion. Nonetheless, the majority concluded that the\n\u201cmost likely actual fact\u201d was that Robertson was not present, a finding that\nmet the standard for clear and convincing evidence. Under New York law, the\nTax Division can\u2019t appeal a tribunal decision in favor of the taxpayer.\n\nRobertson\u2019s lawyer, Fred Feingold, said that his client fought the case\nlargely as a matter of principle: \u201cHe\u2019s a man of great integrity, and some of\nthe questioning basically called him a liar. He was angry.\u201d (Robertson\ndeclined to comment.)\n\nAlso working in Robertson\u2019s favor may have been his willingness to pay New\nYork City taxes during the two years he stayed by his wife\u2019s side during her\ncancer treatments. Based on his liability for the year 2000, that act of\nloyalty cost him some twenty-seven million dollars in additional tax liability\nfor each year. Josephine Robertson lost her battle with cancer in 2010. The\nmonth before she died, she and her husband gave twenty-seven million dollars\nto the New York Stem Cell Foundation, for cancer research. \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the March 19, 2012, issue.\n\nJames B.
