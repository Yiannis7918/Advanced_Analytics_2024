According to a New York Times article published the\nfollowing week, the phenomenon occurred right nearby the house of one Allen\nCrouch, whose wife was outside making soap when it happened.\n\nBy Bec Crew\n\nThis article was published in Scientific American\u2019s former blog network and\nreflects the views of the author, not necessarily those of Scientific American\n\nOn 3 March 1876, large hunks of flesh fell from the sky over Olympia Springs\nin Bath County, Kentucky.\n\nAccording to a New York Times article published the following week, the\nphenomenon occurred right nearby the house of one Allen Crouch, whose wife was\noutside making soap when it happened. \u201cThe meat, which looked like beef, fell\nall around her. The sky was perfectly clear at the time, and she said it fell\nlike large snowflakes.\u201d\n\nIf this was a documentary, the words \"MEAT SHOWER\" would appear on screen\nright now, with trickles of little red meat flakes falling behind. A few\nselect flakes would fall in front of the words for effect.\n\nBack at the Crouch residence, a Mr Harrison Gill - whose veracity was\ndescribed by the The New York Times as \"unquestionable\" - visited the day\nafter the alleged flesh falls and noted the presence of meat sticking out of\nthe fences and scattered across the ground. At least one of the hunks measured\n10 centimetres squared, but most were about 5 x 5 cm. They were apparently\nfresh when they fell, but having been left out all night, they were now\nspoiled and dry.\n\nTwo unidentified gentlemen turned up to taste the meat-rain and declared that\nit had the flavour of either venison or mutton.\n\n\"WTF is even going on here?\" The New York Timesdidn\u2019t say at the time.\n\nThe first explanation came three months later, when someone called Leopold\nBrandeis received and analysed some of the specimens that had been preserved\nin glycerine. He announced that the \u2018meat\u2019 was not actually meat at all. \"At\nlast we have a proper explanation of this much talked of phenomenon,\u201d it was\nreported in Scientific American that year. \"It has been comparatively easy to\nidentify the substance and to fix its status. The Kentucky 'wonder' is no more\nor less than nostoc.\"\n\nA type of cyanobacteria that forms colonies surrounded by a protective\ngelatinous envelope, nostoc is known to swell up into a translucent jelly-like\nmass whenever it rains. Because it\u2019s so inconspicuous when dry, for many\nyears, people believed nostoc to float on the breeze until it rained, which\ncaused it to fall from the sky like hail. Colourful nicknames such as \"star\njelly\", \"witch's butter\", and \"star-slubber\" were thrown around.\n\nBrandeis identified the Kentucky nostoc as belonging to the species Nostoc\ncraneum, which he described as \"flesh-coloured\u201d in The Sanitarian. But really,\nit honestly just looks like the colour of seaweed. It tastes like frog or\nspring chicken legs, he said, and had ballooned and fallen upon the Crouch\nresidence when it rained.\n\nBut wait a minute, what rain? Didn't the Crouches report it to be a perfectly\nclear night? Brandeis!\n\nFortunately, Brandeis didn't play a completely useless role in the\ninvestigation, because he had given a couple of mystery meat samples to\nexperienced histologist and president of the Newark Scientific Association,\nDr. A. Mead Edwards, who said it was likely the lung tissue of a human infant\nor a horse. Another histologist, Dr. J.W.S. Arnold, studied the specimens and\nagreed, concluding in The American Journal of Microscopy and Popular Science\nthat they consisted of some kind of animal cartilage and lung tissue.\n\nEventually, seven samples were examined by several scientists, who confirmed\ntwo to be lung tissue, three to be muscular tissue, and two were said to be\nmade of cartilage. So how did they come to be involved in the Infamous\nKentucky Shower of Flesh?\n\nEnter the man with the best explanation for the \"shower of quivering flesh\u201d\nthat we\u2019re probably ever going to get - Dr L. D Kastenbine, who wrote in a\n1876 edition of the Louisville Medical Newsthat it was, quite literally, a\ncoordinated bout of projectile vulture vomit.\n\nHaving obtained a sample of his own, Kastenbine set fire to it and observed\nthat it smelt distinctly of rancid mutton. \u201cThe only plausible theory\nexplanatory of this anomalous shower appears to me to be that suggested by the\nold Ohio farmer - the disgorgement of some vultures that were sailing over the\nspot, from their immense height, the particles were scattered by the\nprevailing wind over the ground,\" he wrote. \u201cThe variety of tissue discovered\n- muscular, connective, fatty, structureless etc - can be explained only by\nthis theory.\u201d\n\nTwo species of vulture are found in Kentucky - the black vulture (Coragyps\natratus) and the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) - both of which are known to\nprojectile vomit their stomach contents away as either a defence mechanism or\nto make themselves light enough for flight. So maybe?\n\nOr, you know, it was this guy:\n\nRelated posts:\n\nMeet Miracle Mike, the Colorado Chicken who lived for 18 months without his\nhead\n\nThe Great Emu War: In which some large, flightless birds unwittingly foiled\nthe Australian Army\n\nKing of the Killer Whales: The Legend of Old Tom and the Gruesome \u2018Law of the\nTongue\u2019\n\nBec Crew is a Sydney-based science writer and award-winning blogger.
