It emanates from an origin that precedes frail\nbeings. According to a hymn of creation in the Rig Veda, love is a fundamental\npresence: \u2018In the beginning arose Love\u2019 \u2013 or K\u0101ma in Sanskrit: the love that\nsparks desire and vitalises consciousness through practices of yogic\nattention. In mystical Islamic traditions, love is similarly comprehended as\nan external power more than an emotion. For the Sufi, love forces believers,\nwho are called lovers, out of themselves towards the Beloved, who is God. Even\nStoicism was originally a discipline for discovering that the world is shaped\nby the Logos, or active word of creative love.\n\nToday, this appreciation of reality, with its \u2018built-in significance\u2019 and\n\u2018admirable design\u2019, to quote C S Lewis, has become a \u2018discarded image\u2019. Any\ncurious person enquiring of the universe now, and inspired by science, might\nfeel themselves to be confronted by a reality of unknown or unknowable\nsignificance, or of no significance at all. Moreover, such doubt or confusion\nseems to be the price of rejecting a fanciful worldview for a scientific one.\nApprehending the universe no longer consists of an awesome realisation that\nyour mind fits the divine mind to some degree, but becomes one of uncertain,\nprobing wonder: intellectual humility threatened by cognitive humiliation. Nor\ncan anyone who is suffering turn to myths and rituals conveying the purposes\nof a love that exceeds and might contain their afflictions; they must bear\ntheir woe alone or, if they are lucky, in solidarity with similarly isolated\nothers.\n\nAs a psychotherapist, I feel sure this feeling of existential seclusion\nexacerbates distress as well as other symptoms, like excessive consumption or\nspiritual discontent. Although the prevalence of suffering is given as a prime\nreason to reject the existence of divine love, paradoxically, I suspect its\ndismissal has made suffering worse. The healing power of having suffering\nrecognised and understood, even when its causes remain, is a phenomenon that\nanyone engaged in caring will know. To be with suffering, which is more than\njust to witness it, is to be vulnerable, which can in turn bring an awareness\nthat love and connection are basic and immovable. This is why people attest to\nfinding God in suffering, regardless of rational objections. That mystery is\ncentral to any sure \u2013 as opposed to merely asserted \u2013 conviction that there is\ndivine love.\n\nLove is the formidable helpmate of our attention. This was something on which\nthe philosopher Simone Weil, who famously took upon herself the sufferings of\nothers, insisted \u2013 refusing, for example, to consume more that the miserable\nrations allowed her compatriots in France, when she was confined to a hospital\nbed in London in 1943. \u2018By loving the order of the world we imitate the divine\nlove which created this universe of which we are a part,\u2019 she wrote.\n\nPut another way, love was considered a universal force and a matter for\nknowledge, integral to the warp and weft of reality, not just a beneficent\nfeeling or costly duty, practised at a personal level in acts of compassion or\ncharity. When someone received love or gave it, they aligned themselves with\nthe fundamental vitality pulsing through them and everything else. Sun and\nmoon, mountains and seas, plants and birds, beasts of water and land.\nEverything participated in a common movement of love that would eventually\nreturn them to their source and sustainer.\n\nHuman beings could intentionally attend to this dynamic and collaborate with\nit. But, if not, if love is demoted from this role it becomes, at best, a\nmoral ideal or emotion, exapted from evolution and sustained by the brain.\nMetaphysical agnosticism has replaced \u2018ontological rootedness\u2019, to borrow from\nthe philosopher Simon May. Little wonder people feel disorientated or worse.\nTo misquote R D Laing: someone who describes love as an epiphenomenon might be\na great scientist, but someone who lives as if love is so will need a good\npsychiatrist.\n\nBut might the older notion of love be returning, as Weil and others have\nhoped? Might we be moving past the Romantics, who strove to comfort modern\nminds disturbed by what William Wordsworth called the \u2018still, sad music of\nhumanity\u2019 because we are coming to know once more of that \u2018holier love\u2019? Might\nlove be not just all you need, but something precisely required to account for\nwho we are and all that is?\n\nProvocative hints that challenge a reflexive discounting of the enchanted\nvision, and which might spur a shift by reorientating attention and re-opening\navenues of perception, can be drawn from moral philosophy, trends in\ncontemporary biology and by considering the nature of intelligence. Consider\nfirst the moral issue. It begins with the observation that uncoupling love\nfrom its divine telos, and redescribing it solely in terms of evolved\nbehaviours and all-too-human desires, has had unintended consequences. In\nparticular, the secular turn has inverted the dictum that God is love, and\nmade love a god, encouraging a sentimentalisation of love \u2013 a sappy deity for\nan otherwise godless age. Worse, the reversal excites a demand that is\nimpossible to meet, by tasking humans with offering the unconditional love\nthat, until a couple of centuries ago, would have been taken as coming only\nfrom God.\n\nWhen unconditional love was known as a divine emanation, to claim that\ncapacity for oneself, or to ask it of another, was a form of madness or\nidolatry. But now everyone is supposed to deliver and receive it, and overlook\nthat we mortals are flawed and floundering. For such reasons, the\npsychoanalyst Jacques Lacan proposed that, in a world without God, love is\nmore honestly defined as a pact. \u2018To love is, essentially, to wish to be\nloved,\u2019 he said: in other words, I\u2019ll give you what we can call love, if you\noffer me the same. The trouble is, such deals undermine and destroy love, as\nthe philosopher and novelist Iris Murdoch realised. Compromise and trade-offs\nare part of life, yes, but love\u2019s whole point is to draw us beyond the\ntransactional and mediocre. Consider the nature of creativity, Murdoch writes\nin The Sovereignty of Good (1970): \u2018The true artist is obedient to a\nconception of perfection to which his work is constantly related and re-\nrelated in what seems an external manner.\u2019 Love is likewise not fired by\ninjunctions such as \u2018Improve a little\u2019 but rather by the call \u2018Be perfect!\u2019\n\nThe transcendent end to which love leads needn\u2019t be called God, Murdoch felt,\nthough it must be recognised as superhuman and excellent. Following Plato, she\ncalled it the Good, \u2018the magnetic centre towards which love naturally moves,\u2019\nwhich also reveals the nature of love\u2019s energy. \u2018Love is the tension between\nthe imperfect soul and the magnetic perfection which is conceived of as lying\nbeyond it,\u2019 she continued. That \u2018beyond\u2019 is the key thought here, with its\nintuition that what is most longed for is independent of us. Love is active in\nthe psyche that hopes to know more than is currently even conceivable. To\nforeclose that transformation not only thwarts love, it is dehumanising; since\nto be human is to yearn for contact with more.\n\nThis \u2018sovereignty of good\u2019 is impressive, given the way it appears to call us,\nmake demands upon us, and not let us go. But is that the same as affirming\nlove\u2019s transcendent actuality? Some biologists, it seems, are developing a\nworldview that invites the possibility.\n\nInstead of phrases like \u2018the mating season\u2019, Darwin prefers \u2018the season of\nlove\u2019\n\nThe move is happening in two steps: a first that can be characterised as\nbottom-up; a second, top-down. The bottom-up element stems from the revised\npicture of the living world that has been emerging in recent years. This new\nthinking has left behind the reductive view of life, characterised by Richard\nDawkins as driven by selfish genes, to appreciate that cooperative, holistic\nand interdependent creaturely processes operate at and between all levels of\nlife, from proteins and genes to the organism as a whole \u2013 and beyond,\nincluding ecological interactions with the so-called external environment.\n\nIt\u2019s a fractal picture, driven by the explanatory power derived from\nconsidering how wholes matter quite as much as parts. Patterns of interaction\nthat are present at the micro-level are amplified and transformed at the\nmacro-level, with that in turn affecting the granular. Homologous parallels\ncan be detected across species, too. What manifests as attraction and\ncooperation in simpler organisms becomes altruism and empathy among the more\ncomplex, with love capping the pyramid. Building on the foundations laid by\nbiologists like Lynn Margulis, who championed symbiosis in evolution, and\ndeveloped in books such as Interdependence (2015) by the biologist Kriti\nSharma, the new picture changes the status of love from epiphenomenon to an\nemergent quality, springing from antecedent forms discernible within all sorts\nof interactions and behaviour; if love in all its fullness is present only in\ncreatures like us, capable of forming intentions and consciously acting\nsacrificially, then love\u2019s forerunners run all the way down the chain of\nliving entities.\n\nThis, incidentally, is akin to the opinion of Charles Darwin. In The Descent\nof Man (1871), he discusses the \u2018love-antics\u2019 of birds, alongside using\nfunctional terms such as \u2018display\u2019, and instead of phrases like \u2018the mating\nseason\u2019, he prefers \u2018the season of love\u2019. But he proposes something else, too.\nWhile nascent forms of love might evolve alongside the practicalities of\nsurvival \u2013 caring for offspring, for example \u2013 others, such as meeting\naggression with kindness or loving enemies, would need \u2018the aid of reason,\ninstruction, and the love or fear of God.\u2019 Which brings us to the top-down\nrevision within biology. It shares the vision of an interplay of life\nprocesses across levels. But where the bottom-up biologists detect empathy and\nits precursors in the behaviour of a range of animals, the top-down\nrevisionists are sceptical that complex psychological capacities like empathy\nexist in any creatures except humans.\n\nIn From Extraterrestrials to Animal Minds: Six Myths of Evolution (2022), the\nevolutionary biologist Simon Conway Morris examines the evidence for empathy\nin creatures from crows to chimps, and finds the data wanting. The matter is\nsubtle and often raises hackles, but the crucial point is that context\nmatters. The environment in which animals live shapes how they behave, as it\ndoes with humans, but for nonhuman animals context radically determines what\nbehaviour is possible in the first place. Empathy is a case in point, because\nbeing moved by the suffering of a stranger, for instance, is morally\nsignificant when it can happen regardless of context, which no other animal\nappears capable of. \u2018It is far from clear that our nearest cousins are\nanywhere near a moral dimension,\u2019 Conway Morris concludes.\n\nHis alternative proposal, in line with Darwin\u2019s conclusion about what it takes\nto love enemies, is that humans can access and align with moral verities, by\nvirtue of being aware of a transcendent dimension that has not emerged, but\nbeen discovered. The human capacity for emotional self-regulation, say, and\nthe ability to have sympathy with radically diverse perspectives, means that\nwe can be open to the revelation of moral features of reality, top-down. The\nimplication is that, while there are certainly analogues to love in other\nparts of the animal kingdom, these do not form complete pathways for\nevolutionary development. Rather, our ancestors have readied us for the\nperception of a love that pre-exists us.\n\nNeedless to say, the top-down conclusion is controversial, given the overtone\nof human exceptionalism, to say nothing of the implication that the creatures\nwe love may not equally love us back. But the enquiry can be nudged along by\nextending the matter of what we know and turning to the question of how we\nknow anything at all. In this, what we attend to is crucial.\n\nConsider a delightful anecdote told to me by the astronomer Bernard Carr. A\nformer colleague of Stephen Hawking, Carr joined him at the premiere of the\nfilm about Hawking\u2019s life, The Theory of Everything (2014). Carr was paying\nattention and, as they watched, an irony dawned in his mind. \u2018The film was\nprimarily about Stephen\u2019s personal relationship with Jane, his first wife,\u2019 he\nexplained, \u2018even though personal relationships and emotions, indeed mind\nitself, will probably never be covered by any Theory of Everything.\u2019 In short,\nthe film gave the lie to the aspiration to derive a complete account of\nexistence from physics alone, and the reason is obvious: love is real and\nroutinely experienced by human minds; but scientifically speaking, love can be\nevidenced only indirectly, by measuring the after-effects it leaves in its\noften-turbulent wake.\n\nThat first-hand quality is a feature of many types of knowledge. You can learn\na lot about swimming by reading about swimming, but you can never learn how to\nswim from books. Even knowledge that can be captured in words or equations has\na participatory dimension, of which the words and equations are tokens. Humans\ndon\u2019t only calculate but also comprehend, which the philosopher Mary Midgley\nin Wisdom, Information and Wonder (1989) described as arising from \u2018a loving\nunion\u2019. Her point is that knowledge is never merely information amassed, like\na digital dataset, but involves an intentional engagement with whatever the\ninformation might be about, that latter element being the revelatory issue.\nIntelligence rests on a dialogue with the world; flow is the feeling of\nimmersion in the exchange. And it is love that invites us in.\n\nLove is an active ingredient of our intelligence in another way. Consider the\nwelter of sense-perceptions that bombard us all day, every day. The cognitive\npsychologist John Vervaeke argues that we can make sense of the avalanche of\nwhat we see, hear, smell, taste and touch through what he calls \u2018relevance\nrealisation\u2019; we do not sort through the data, as an AI might, but care for\nsome things above others, and thereby spontaneously spot what matters through\nthe maelstrom. With the exception of the occasional sociopath, people are\ndrawn by what is good, beautiful or true; these qualities organise things for\nus, even when we are not entirely clear what the good, beautiful or true might\nbe. The \u2018transcendentals\u2019, as they were traditionally known, therefore have an\nobjective character, even leading us over current horizons of perception to\ndiscover new insights. Weil put it like this: \u2018The beauty of the world is the\norder of the world that is loved.\u2019\n\nWhen a river enters a larger body of water, the words of Indigenous languages\nallude to love\n\nSuffering is integral to a searching intelligence, too. Breakthroughs often\noccur after breakdowns because wisdom tends to arise not with the accumulation\nof knowledge, but when an old mindset or worldview gives way \u2013 a process that\nis typically troubling and traumatic. But in that transition we are met, which\nis why a discovery may be greeted with a delighted exclamation: Eureka! Our\nminds can knowingly resonate with a wider intelligence, in a way that\u2019s\nseemingly unavailable to other creatures. The pattern of seeds on a\nsunflower\u2019s head may manifest a Fibonacci sequence, but humans can spot the\nmathematical and almost musical regularity \u2013 and, driven by love, delight in\nit.\n\nMy suspicion is that noticing the felt experience of our connection with the\nnatural world, the associated moments of beauty and revelation, and concluding\nthat the resulting joy is given as a gift, is part of the reason that\nIndigenous ways of knowing are reviving. \u2018Indigenous peoples live in\nrelational worldviews,\u2019 explains Melissa Nelson, a professor at Arizona State\nUniversity, whose heritage includes Anishinaabe, Cree, M\u00e9tis and Norwegian.\nNelson refers to the notion of \u2018original instructions\u2019, which is the array of\nrituals, myths and patterns around which Indigenous ways of life are\norganised, together aimed at deepening communion between humans and the more-\nthan-human. She tells me: \u2018There is a nurturing quality to the universe that\nis for us like a natural law, a universal principle that we can tap into: this\nfield of love that is the matrix of the universe.\u2019 The significance for\nenvironmental and ecological concerns is obvious.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly striking is that analogues of love are perceived in the\ninteractions of the so-called inanimate world, too. For example, when a river\nenters a larger body of water, the word used in several Indigenous languages\nalludes to love, Nelson says. Alternatively, viewing the planets or stars can\nbe experienced as a relationship: receiving a quality of light that\nsimultaneously lights up the soul \u2013 an insight remembered in words like\n\u2018influence\u2019, which originally meant stellar inflow.\n\nTo my mind, there are implications, here, for re-envisioning the place of\nhumans in the world: part of the distinctiveness of our task is to bring this\nrichness to mind. That can make a difference insofar as it increases the\nattention afforded to love. \u2018We live in dire poverty in many places,\u2019 Nelson\ncontinues, referring to spiritual as well as material need. \u2018But we have this\nprofound understanding of love being a cosmic universal force, that comes to\nus from the natural world and from the universe as a whole. That really\nstrengthens us in terms of our embodiment and survival, and to thrive and\nregenerate.\u2019\n\nThis kind of awareness might be called a participatory consciousness, and it\u2019s\nbeen part and parcel of Western ways of knowing, too. The reciprocity has\ntended to be discounted since the birth of modern science because of the way\ndispassionate objectivity is valued, a stance that has brought gains. But\nperhaps for not much longer. \u2018We do not obtain the most precious gifts by\ngoing in search of them but by waiting for them,\u2019 Weil observed, because gifts\nare given in love and spotted by the right quality of attention.\n\nThe ramifications of reincorporating something of the premodern view are far\nreaching. Existential loneliness can be tried, found wanting, and reframed:\nit\u2019s not all in your head. Or there is the feeling of wonder and connectedness\nthat comes with awareness of the extraordinary nature of reality. The\nexperience is offered a rationale: our minds fit the intelligence that shapes\nthe world. Maybe, too, a love recognised as drawing us can invite us to stop\ntrying to turn our corner of the universe into a tortured, technological\nparadise, and instead consider how we might design ways of life that deepen\nour attention, better harmonise with the planet and our nonhuman fellows, and\neven raise awareness of its divine wellspring. We might want to attend to the\nbest once more, and bear what it takes to commune with this abundance, because\nthere is a cosmic love and we can move with its power, along with everything\nelse that is.\n\nMetaphysicsThinkers and theoriesLove and friendship\n\n19 April 2024\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nKnowledge\n\nWhat is \u2018lived experience\u2019?\n\nThe term is ubiquitous and double-edged.
