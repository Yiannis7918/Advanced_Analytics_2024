This client supports both ACME v1 and the new ACME v2 including\nsupport for wildcard certificates!\n\nIt uses the openssl utility for everything related to actually handling keys\nand certificates, so you need to have that installed.\n\nOther dependencies are: cURL, sed, grep, awk, mktemp (all found pre-installed\non almost any system, cURL being the only exception).\n\nCurrent features:\n\n  * Signing of a list of domains (including wildcard domains!)\n  * Signing of a custom CSR (either standalone or completely automated using hooks!)\n  * Renewal if a certificate is about to expire or defined set of domains changed\n  * Certificate revocation\n  * and lots more..\n\nPlease keep in mind that this software, the ACME-protocol and all supported CA\nservers out there are relatively young and there might be a few issues. Feel\nfree to report any issues you find with this script or contribute by\nsubmitting a pull request, but please check for duplicates first (feel free to\ncomment on those to get things rolling).\n\n## Getting started\n\nFor getting started I recommend taking a look at docs/domains_txt.md,\ndocs/wellknown.md and the Usage section on this page (you'll probably only\nneed the -c option).\n\nGenerally you want to set up your WELLKNOWN path first, and then fill in\ndomains.txt.\n\nPlease note that you should use the staging URL when experimenting with this\nscript to not hit Let's Encrypt's rate limits. See docs/staging.md.\n\nIf you have any problems take a look at our Troubleshooting guide.\n\n## Config\n\ndehydrated is looking for a config file in a few different places, it will use\nthe first one it can find in this order:\n\n  * /etc/dehydrated/config\n  * /usr/local/etc/dehydrated/config\n  * The current working directory of your shell\n  * The directory from which dehydrated was run\n\nHave a look at docs/examples/config to get started, copy it to e.g.\n/etc/dehydrated/config and edit it to fit your needs.\n\n## Usage:\n\n    \n    \n    Usage: ./dehydrated [-h] [command [argument]] [parameter [argument]] [parameter [argument]] ... Default command: help Commands: --version (-v) Print version information --display-terms Display current terms of service --register Register account key --account Update account contact information --cron (-c) Sign/renew non-existent/changed/expiring certificates. --signcsr (-s) path/to/csr.pem Sign a given CSR, output CRT on stdout (advanced usage) --revoke (-r) path/to/cert.pem Revoke specified certificate --deactivate Deactivate account --cleanup (-gc) Move unused certificate files to archive directory --cleanup-delete (-gcd) Deletes (!) unused certificate files --help (-h) Show help text --env (-e) Output configuration variables for use in other scripts Parameters: --accept-terms Accept CAs terms of service --full-chain (-fc) Print full chain when using --signcsr --ipv4 (-4) Resolve names to IPv4 addresses only --ipv6 (-6) Resolve names to IPv6 addresses only --domain (-d) domain.tld Use specified domain name(s) instead of domains.txt entry (one certificate!) --ca url/preset Use specified CA URL or preset --alias certalias Use specified name for certificate directory (and per-certificate config) instead of the primary domain (only used if --domain is specified) --keep-going (-g) Keep going after encountering an error while creating/renewing multiple certificates in cron mode --force (-x) Force certificate renewal even if it is not due to expire within RENEW_DAYS --force-validation Force revalidation of domain names (used in combination with --force) --no-lock (-n) Don't use lockfile (potentially dangerous!) --lock-suffix example.com Suffix lockfile name with a string (useful for with -d) --ocsp Sets option in CSR indicating OCSP stapling to be mandatory --privkey (-p) path/to/key.pem Use specified private key instead of account key (useful for revocation) --domains-txt path/to/domains.txt Use specified domains.txt instead of default/configured one --config (-f) path/to/config Use specified config file --hook (-k) path/to/hook.sh Use specified script for hooks --preferred-chain issuer-cn Use alternative certificate chain identified by issuer CN --out (-o) certs/directory Output certificates into the specified directory --alpn alpn-certs/directory Output alpn verification certificates into the specified directory --challenge (-t) http-01|dns-01|tls-alpn-01 Which challenge should be used? Currently http-01, dns-01, and tls-alpn-01 are supported --algo (-a) rsa|prime256v1|secp384r1 Which public key algorithm should be used? Supported: rsa, prime256v1 and secp384r1\n\n## Chat\n\nDehydrated has an official IRC-channel #dehydrated on libera.chat that can be\nused for general discussion and suggestions.\n\nThe channel can also be accessed with Matrix using the official libera.chat\nbridge at #dehydrated:libera.chat.\n\n## About\n\nletsencrypt/acme client implemented as a shell-script \u2013 just add water\n\ndehydrated.io\n\n### Topics\n\nshell bash letsencrypt zsh certificate signing acme\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nMIT license\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n5.7k stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n174 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n706 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 14\n\nv0.7.1 Latest\n\nOct 31, 2022\n\n\\+ 13 releases\n\n## Sponsor this project\n\n  * lukas2511 Lukas Schauer\n\n  * https://paypal.me/lukas2511\n  * http://www.amazon.de/registry/wishlist/1TUCFJK35IO4Q\n\nLearn more about GitHub Sponsors\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 87\n\n\\+ 73 contributors\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Shell 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
