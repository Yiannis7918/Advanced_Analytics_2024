Additionally, the migration service Super Slurper\nnow extends its support to Google Cloud Storage and a new infrequent access\nstorage tier is available in private beta.\n\nPresently in open beta, event notifications dispatch messages to a queue\nwhenever there's a change to data within a bucket. These messages are\nsubsequently received by a consumer Worker, allowing developers to define any\nsubsequent actions needed. Matt DeBoard, Mengqi Chen, Siddhant Sinha, systems\nengineers at Cloudflare, and Erin Thames, product designer at Cloudflare,\nwrite:\n\n> The lifecycle of data often doesn\u2019t stop immediately after upload to an R2\n> bucket \u2013 event data may need to be transformed and loaded into a data\n> warehouse, media files may need to go through a post-processing step, etc.\n> We\u2019re releasing event notifications for R2 in open beta to enable building\n> applications and workflows driven by your changing data.\n\nSource: Cloudflare blog\n\nDesigned for data lakes, storage for cloud-native applications, and web\ncontent, Cloudflare R2 enables developers to store unstructured data using\nS3-like APIs. Dubbed the \u2018zero egress fee object storage platform\u2019 by\nCloudflare to emphasize its main differentiator from competing globally\ndistributed object storage services, R2 offers dynamic functionalities that\nintegrate with Cloudflare Workers.\n\nReleased last year with support for Amazon S3 only, Super Slurper is a\nmigration service that enables developers to move all their data to R2 in \"one\ngiant slurp\" or \"sip by sip\" and now supports also Google Cloud Storage as a\nsource. Migration jobs preserve custom object metadata from the source bucket\nby copying them on the migrated objects on R2 and do not delete any objects\nfrom the source bucket.\n\nInitially released last year with support exclusively for Amazon S3, Super\nSlurper is a migration service that enables developers to transfer their data\nto R2 either in one comprehensive transfer or gradually. The service now\nextends its compatibility to Google Cloud Storage as a source. Migration jobs\npreserve custom object metadata from the source bucket by replicating them\nonto the migrated objects in R2.\n\nThe private beta release of the Infrequent Access storage class, a cost-\neffective option with comparable performance and durability, marked the third\nfeature announcement for R2 during Developer Week. This new storage class can\nbe assigned either through APIs or lifecycle policies and is tailored for\nscenarios involving infrequently accessed data, such as long-tail user-\ngenerated content or logs. DeBoard, Chen, Sinha, and Thames add:\n\n> In the future, we plan to automatically optimize storage classes for data so\n> you can avoid manually creating rules and better adapt to changing data\n> access patterns.\n\nOn Hacker News, user thrixton questions the pricing of the new tier:\n\n> So pricing is 1c / GB-month, compared to S3 IA at 1.25c / GB-month, a decent\n> saving but not massive, no archive or deep archive options though, I wonder\n> if / when these will come. What sort of negotiated rates can you get from\n> AWS for bandwidth I wonder, at the moment, that seems like the only real\n> benefit from CF I think.\n\nWhile there are no egress fees on the class, a data retrieval fee of USD\n0.01/GB (the same amount as AWS S3-IA) is charged when data in the Infrequent\nAccess storage class is accessed.\n\nWhile the Infrequent Access storage class does not incur egress fees, a data\nretrieval fee of USD 0.01/GB (equivalent to AWS S3-IA) is charged when data\nwithin this tier is retrieved.\n\n## About the Author\n\n#### Renato Losio\n\nRenato has extensive experience as a cloud architect, tech lead, and cloud\nservices specialist.
