The carts have an iPad-looking screen, AI-aided cameras and a\nscanner system that allows shoppers to price items and literally \u201cadd to cart\u201d\nas they walk around the store. Then, like magic, you can roll out to the\nparking lot along a special lane. That\u2019s right\u2014no more waiting in lengthy\nWhole Foods checkout lines.\n\nThe San Mateo store was the first in California to launch the technology,\nwhich is meant to replace Amazon\u2019s contactless \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d checkout\nsystem, which was beset by technical issues. However, the concept is part of\nAmazon\u2019s larger strategy to automate the physical retail experience.\n\nIn my experience, though, stationary self-checkout systems often require\nwaving down a store employee when the robot glitches out. It often ends up\ntaking longer than waiting in line for a human cashier, so my initial thought\nwas, \"Would this wheelie version actually save me time?\u201d\n\n## \u2018Your cart is experiencing issues\u2019\n\nNaturally, my attempt at using this futuristic shopping method started with a\nglitch. \"Your cart is experiencing issues; try a different cart.\u201d\n\nBut these things weigh, like, five times that of a normal cart, by my\nassessment. So grabbing a working one was far from a breeze.\n\nOnce I finally had a working Dash Cart, I found the technology easy enough to\nuse. There was a guest option, but that seemed overly complicated, so I opted\nto use the Amazon App to connect the cart to my Prime account.\n\nAmazon's new Dash Carts are heavier than usual due in large part to an iPad-looking screen, AI-aided cameras and a scanner system that allows shoppers to price items. | Source: Estefany Gonzalez/The Standard\n\nBefore I could even enter the store and start smart shopping, I waited 15\nagonizing minutes for spotty cell service until a passerby told me the store\nhas Wi-Fi.\n\nThe cart has a scanner attached to the handlebars that let you scan items as\nyou put them into it. It was easy to use and didn\u2019t double-scan as easily as\nthe self-checkouts.\n\nFor produce, sometimes the cart asks for the quantity. Other times, it asks\nfor the user to place the produce in the cart to determine the weight. At\nfirst, I was skeptical about how accurately it could determine the weight with\nno visible scale in sight, but after a few attempts, I accepted the weight on\nthe screen without much thought.\n\nMy impulsive habits often derail my grocery store budget. Chocolate-covered\npretzel bites? Don\u2019t mind if I do. However, the smart carts' intuitive cost\ntallying was incredibly helpful for sticking to a budget.\n\n## \u2018I don\u2019t have to wait in line\u2019\n\nFirst-time Dash Cart user Suchada Peungtuan, whom I bumped into in the jam\naisle with her daughter, found the technology impressive overall, although\nthere was a bit of a learning curve.\n\n\"Next time will be more smoother,\" Peungtuan said. \"We had to understand the\nsystem.\"\n\nOthers have made using the technology second nature. Fellow shopper Jason Vang\npicks up a Dash Cart nearly every time he goes to Whole Foods and prefers it\nto a traditional cart.\n\n\"I don't have to wait in line. I just push the cart out,\" Vang said. \"It's\nvery convenient; it's just a little heavy to maneuver, but that's about it.\"\n\nSuchada Peungtuan was a first-time user of Amazon's new Dash Cart technology at the San Mateo Whole Foods, who said the device had a bit of a learning curve. | Source: Estefany Gonzalez/The Standard\n\nThen there was the other end of the spectrum. One user I ran into in the\nparking lot found the process of using the technology so frustrating that she\nvoided her entire purchase.\n\n\"We just went through the normal queue,\" said Nidhi Shah as she pushed the\nloaded Dash Cart toward her car full of groceries.\n\nThe problem was that she had her toddler stowed in the smart cart.\n\n\"He kept scanning things,\" she said. \"The cart was also recognizing him as an\nunidentified object. Every few seconds, I had to hit cancel on that.\"\n\nAs for me? I couldn\u2019t find the button for the rosemary sourdough on the quick\nmenu while I was shopping, so I put it back. Is that good for business?\nProbably not, but hey, I got out of there without spending my whole paycheck\nat Whole Foods\u2014and I didn\u2019t have to wait in line.\n\n## Filed Under\n\nAIAmazonBusinessGroceryLifeWhole Foods Market\n\n## Read More\n\n  * ### Cold case mystery: A mutilated bear, in a freezer, floating in the Bay\n\nMystery surrounds a cold case where police found a dead bear floating in a\nfreezer on the San Francisco Bay.\n\n  * ### \u2018Build any goddamn thing!\u2019: Why this big Sunset lot has sat empty forever\n\nA weed-ridden patch of sand has sat empty in the Sunset for decades, and there\nhaven\u2019t been plans to do anything with it for 20 years.\n\n  * ### OAK wants to add SF to its name.
