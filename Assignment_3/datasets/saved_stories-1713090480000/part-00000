Digital audio recording is now\nubiquitous, inexpensive, and available to anyone with access to a computer and\na basic audio interface. However, this was not always the case. During the\n1970s, designers of emerging digital recording technologies collaborated with\nsound engineers, producers and artists, helping to establish standards for the\ncapture, editing, playback and storage of digital audio; paradigms that would\ncome to govern much of modern recording.^1 This article takes the form of a\ncase study, examining the introduction and development of commercial digital\nrecording technologies in the United States between 1975-1983, through the\nexperiences of an early innovator in the field.\n\nSoundstream, incorporated in 1975 in Salt Lake City, Utah, was the first\ncommercial digital audio recording company in the United States.^2 Despite\nincreasing competition from larger companies, and strong resistance from some\nareas of the \u2018audiophile\u2019 community, Soundstream played an important role in\nthe developing standards of digital recording, editing and mastering during\nthis period and their influence can still be observed today. Although one\ncannot assume that all companies operate in the same way as Soundstream, its\nexperiences in the sound recording and music industries reveal a great deal\nabout the introduction of new technologies generally. For users of recording\ntechnologies, this was a period of profound technological change in which\nemerging digital tools afforded opportunies for new ways of working. While\npointing out why the work of Soundstream is significant in the history of\nsound recording, this article raises a number of questions about the take up\nof new technologies. For instance, are the specifications of new technologies\ndetermined entirely by designers and manufacturers? Do new technologies\nusually meets the needs of their intended users? Can user feedback make\ntechnologies more useful and more commercially viable? Do these kinds of\ninnovations tend to immediately supersede extant technologies? Are the highest\nstandards available usually the ones that become widely adopted by users? Are\nthese kinds of technical and cultural innovations actually disruptive, or part\nof a broader continuity? And is resistance towards new technologies usually\nmotivated by the preservation of technical standards?\n\nFollowing the path laid by comprehensive studies of the social conditions of\ntechnological innovation, such as Th\u00e9berge (1997), this research attempts to\ntake a holistic approach to its subject, examining design and development, the\nagency of users and the context within which this activity takes place. This\narticle takes the position that the design of new technologies cannot fully\ndetermine how they become embedded in the working practices of users; it\nargues that these relationships are negotiated over time in response to the\nneeds of users and in accordance with the political economic and cultural\nforces that help to shape the opportunities available to producers of such\ntechnologies. This case study aims to illustrate some of the complexities in\nthese relationships, providing examples of how these important drivers\narticulate the spaces within which designers and users participate in an\nongoing negotiation between what is possible (and desirable) economically,\ncreatively and culturally.^3\n\nThis research is best contextualised by using concepts from the\ninterdisciplinary field of sound studies (Pinch and Bijsterveld: 2004, 635).\nSound studies aims to conflate the wealth of \u2018conceptually fragmented\u2019\nliterature on the \u2018history and philosophy of sound\u2019 (Sterne: 2003, 4), in\norder to make more meaningful connections between how technology is produced\nand ultimately used. As Durant (1990, 180) has suggested, \u2018music is never\nsimply led by technological invention, as is suggested in crude forms of\ntechnological determinism\u2019. Indeed, users often find unconventional ways to\nachieve their goals, blurring the boundaries between design and use. Pinch and\nTrocco (2002) argue this point convincingly in their study of the Invention\nand Impact of the Moog Synthesiser, as does Durant (1990, 180), who points out\nthat technological developments can \u2018lead to networks of reactions, responses\nand effects that cannot be predicted merely from the resources or design of\nthe technology itself\u2019.^4\n\nReflections on the development and use of recording technologies have examined\nissues such as the agency of the record producer (Jarrett: 2004; Moorefield:\n2010), the role of the recording engineer (Kealy: 1979; Horning: 2004) and new\nparadigms instituted by digital technologies (Stockham: 1971b, 1982, 1987;\nDurant: 1990; Levitin: 1994a, 1994b and Fine: 2008). Chanan (1995), Morton\n(2000), Warner (2003) and Katz (2004) are among those who have explored the\nrelationship between recording technologies and the users who interact with\nthem, while scholars such as Oudshoorn and Pinch (2003) have argued in favour\nof focusing on the user\u2019s experience of technology rather than the inventor or\nthe artefact itself. There have also been cultural studies of technological\nartefacts, how they are represented, produced and consumed, such as The Study\nof the Sony Walkman (Du Gay, Hall et al: 2003). However, as Pinch and\nBijsterveld (2004, 636) have noted, \u2018whole areas of music technology and vast\nareas of listener experience remain completely uncharted.\u2019 Horning\u2019s (2004)\nstudy, for example, explores the evolution of music recording from the\nacoustical era until \u2018roughly the present\u2019 (2004, 704). However, her analysis\nends prior to the introduction of commercial digital recording technologies in\nthe United States. This period during the 1970s marked the beginning of the\nmodern era of sound recording. Examining the transformative nature of this\nperiod through the lens of the chosen case study can tell us a lot about the\ndevelopment and take up of new technologies within the sound recording and\nmusic industries, not only during that time, but in the present day.\n\nDuring the process of conducting this research, interviews were recorded (or\nin a few cases, captured through written exchanges) with an array of\nindividuals. These were primarily computer scientists (such as Jules\nBloomenthal and Bruce Rothaar), recording engineers and editors (such as\nSydney Davis, Rich Feldman, Tom MacCluskey, James Wolvington and Robert Woods)\nand producers who either worked for, recorded with, or were affiliated in some\nway with Soundstream (Ken Caillat, Tom Jung, Elaine Martone). Much of the\nliterature described herein has been vital in informing this research. In\nparticular, the work of Dr. Thomas Stockham has provided not only specific\nscientific details of digital recording theory, but also detailed accounts of\nthe development, introduction and use of the Soundstream recording machine.\n\nThis article proceeds with a brief history of Soundstream and an introduction\nto its key personnel. In setting out the case study, the findings have been\norganised into three sections. The first section examines the design and\ndevelopment of Soundstream\u2019s digital tape recorder and considers the\nconditions under which the product was produced and tested. It demonstrates\nthe development of a product from prototype stage through to testing in real\nworld environments, the gathering of user feedback from within the sound\nrecording and music industries, and the ways in which these responses can\ntransform the specifications of the final product. Section two looks at the\nopportunities available to Soundstream to sell its product and examines the\nchallenges faced by the company in achieving widespread adoption of the\nrecorder. This is important because responses to new technologies are often\nnot as predicted by designers and manufacturers. Understanding and acting upon\nthis kind of feedback can affect both the reputation of a new technology and\nthe commercial opportunities available to its creators. Finally, section three\npresents an analysis of the competition faced by Soundstream and examines the\ncontext for the company\u2019s demise. As with most fields marrying commerce with\ncreativity, the sound recording and music industries are a complex synergy of\npolitical and cultural forces that can have ramifications for new\ntechnologies, regardless of their features, functions, or specifications.\nThese facets of the process are illustrated with reference to the experiences\nof Soundstream, the exemplar in this case. The article ends with some brief\nconclusions relating the findings to current practice.\n\n### Soundstream and the introduction of digital audio\n\nSoundstream Inc. was a digital audio recording company founded by Dr. Thomas\nG. Stockham Jr. at the University of Utah during May 1975. Soundstream was the\nfirst commercial digital audio recording company in the United States\nproviding on-location recording services and computer based digital audio\nediting.^5 Stockham established Soundstream out of a desire to tackle what he\nperceived to be problems with analogue audio, particularly distortions such as\nbackground noise and the effects of recording horns in vintage records\n(Stockham: 1971a; 1982). Stockham earned his degree at MIT (Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology) in 1959, becoming an Assistant Professor of\nElectrical Engineering at the Institute and a researcher at the famed Lincoln\nLaboratory. In 1963, Stockham helped fellow MIT scientist Amar Bose design the\ncorner 2201 loudspeaker.^6 He also advanced a now widely accepted computer\nmodel for human vision and developed \u2018blind deconvolution\u2019, a process which\npermitted the restoration of blurred photographs and the restoration of old\nacoustic recordings.^7 This was evidenced most notably by RCA\u2019s Enrico Caruso\nseries.^8 He left in 1968 for the computer science department at the\nUniversity of Utah. Stockham received an Emmy in 1988, the first technical\nGrammy award in 1994 and a scientific Academy Award (Oscar) in 1999 for his\ncontribution to the development of digital audio. He has been described as\n\u2018the father of digital sound\u2019 (Scull: 1998). Stockham was also one of the six-\nperson panel to examine the famous 18-and-a-half minute gap in the \u2018Watergate\u2019\ntapes created in the office of then President of the United States, Richard M.\nNixon.^9\n\nDigital Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM) is the digital representation of a sampled\nanalogue signal. It was invented at Bell Labs during the 1930s for sound\ntransmission and recording in the telephony industry (McGinn: 1983; Fine:\n2008, 2). In 1962, while still at MIT, Stockham had begun making digital audio\ntape recordings using a TX-0 computer and an \u2018analogue-to-digital\u2019 (A/D)\nconverter (Levitin: 1994a). Because digital audio is transferred to tape as\nbinary data, the audio is not subject to the conventional distortions that can\nbe induced by analogue tape recording such as hiss/noise, generational loss\nand print-through. Likewise, distortions introduced by the limitations of\nanalogue playback formats, such as \u2018wow\u2019 and \u2018flutter\u2019, were un-measurable in\nthe digital domain. The promise of sample accurate editing, copying, flat\nfrequency response, and seemingly indefinite storage options also seemed\nadvantageous. By 1969, engineers at the Technical Research Laboratory of\nJapan\u2019s NHK broadcast network had developed a fully operational two channel\nstereo recorder with a 32 kHz sampling rate and 13-bit resolution (Fine: 2008,\n2).^10 In January 1971, Denon used the NHK recorder to produce the first\ndigitally recorded commercial release; a jazz recording by Steve Marcus called\nSomething (1971, Nippon Columbia, NCB-7003) (Fine: 2008, 3).^11 In 1972, Denon\ndemonstrated the DN-023R, an eight-channel recorder operating at a sampling\nrate of 47.25 kHz and 13-bit resolution.^12\n\nIn 1975, Soundstream began work on its prototype digital audio recorder. Tom\nStockham was the company\u2019s President and designed the architecture for the\nmachine. Richard Warnock, also from the University of Utah, was Soundstream\u2019s\nChief Electrical Engineer during this period; he designed the circuitry that\nwould realise Stockham\u2019s design. Warnock hired Bruce Rothaar (a graduate\nstudent in Electrical Engineering) as a Junior Electrical Engineer. Several\nother students, mostly from the Computer Science department, were hired as\ntechnicians to wire and test the circuitry. Jules Bloomenthal was one such\nemployee and the only one to stay with the company. Bloomenthal joined\nSoundstream in September 1975 as a technician, helping to build a computer\ninterface that would allow direct, real-time transfer of digital audio data\nbetween a computer and a recorder. At this time, Robert B. Ingebretsen was\nalso hired to take charge of the company\u2019s software. In 1976, Richard Warnock\nleft the company and Bruce Rothaar became Soundstream\u2019s Chief Electrical\nEngineer.\n\n### Design and development\n\nFrom the start, a progressive culture was cultivated at Soundstream. Like many\ntechnology companies incubated in academic communities (Demain: 2001),\nStockham\u2019s affiliation with the University of Utah provided access to\nscientific research excellence and opportunities to capitalise on expertise in\nemerging fields. The machine consisted of a commercially available\ninstrumentation tape drive made by Honeywell and a custom chassis of\nelectronics including A-D/D-A (analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue)\nconverters and tape encoding and decoding electronics. Jules Bloomenthal\nrelates that he and colleague Bruce Rothaar were awarded responsibility for\nits visual design with the simple instruction that it \u2018look as professional as\npossible\u2019.^13 A parallel \u2018Unibus\u2019 interface, also designed by Soundstream,\nwould transfer data between the DTR and a Digital Equipment Corporation\nPDP-11/60 computer that was used for editing. Digital audio was stored for\nediting on two \u2018RP04\u2019 disk pack drives connected to the 11/60, which were also\nmanufactured by Digital Equipment Corporation of Massachusetts.^14 The 11/60\nran a software program called \u2018DAP\u2019 (Digital Audio Processor) written by\nSoundstream to perform \u2018random access\u2019 digital audio editing; typical commands\nwould include splices and cross-fades.^15 A Tektronix storage scope (a digital\ncalligraphic line-drawing terminal) provided the waveform display. Commands\nwere entered using a text terminal that had been carefully chosen for its\nhermetically sealed flyback transformer, which made it absolutely silent. Tom\nFine (2008, 4-5) notes that \u2018Stockham\u2019s editing system...was a direct\nprecursor of the modern digital audio workstation and computer based recording\nand editing.\u2019^16\n\nIn the years since, the digital audio workstation has transformed from a high\nprice commodity operated by experts, to an accessible form of technology that\nis frequently found in the domestic space (Th\u00e9berge: 1997, 234). As Moorefield\n(2010, xvii) has pointed out, this widespread democratisation of recording\ntechnology has come about because of \u2018cheap digital memory, miniaturisation,\nand the increasingly globalised economy.\u2019 Moreover, the representation of such\ntechnologies as the tools of liberated artists in magazines aimed at young,\nmale, technically engaged musicians is a powerful catalyst in their ubiquity\n(Th\u00e9berge: 1997, 125). Warner (2003, 20) suggests that \u2018this transition to\ndigital technology has not only brought about a revolution in working\npractices but has also played an important role in determining how pop music\nas an art form has evolved in the past 25 years.\u2019\n\nIn 1976, Soundstream completed the first digital tape recorder (DTR) in the\nUnited States, a two-track, 16-bit machine with a sample rate of 37.5 kHz.^17\nThe first exposure of Soundstream equipment to a commercial recording session\nwas during August of that year. The Soundstream two-channel prototype was\nshipped to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to record its light opera company in a\nperformance of Virgil Thomson/Gertrude Stein\u2019s The Mother of Us All. According\nto Best (1978, 13), the digital recording was intended as a backup to the\nanalogue recording. There was, however, some interest expressed by the label,\nNew World Records, in comparing the two results.^18 The album was released\ninitially from the analogue tapes but subsequently from the digital masters.\nThis secondary use of the equipment during the recording process was a way for\ncompanies to try out the new prototype without a large increase in cost or\nrisk. During commercial recording sessions, Soundstream technicians were\ntypically responsible for ensuring the smooth operation of the digital\nrecorder and did not \u2018engineer\u2019 recordings in the sense that they would choose\nmicrophones, decide on their placement, or interact with musicians. Rather,\nSoundstream staff would collaborate with recording engineers and producers in\nthe service of capturing the musical performance.\n\nJones (1992, 75) notes that, just as with computer software, the manufacturers\nof sound recording equipment often use musicians and recording studios as\n\u2018beta-testers\u2019 in order to get practical feedback about how the equipment\nperforms in real world operation. Changes or modifications are then made which\ncan maximise the commercial potential of the product, enhancing the fortunes\nof the company and saving time and money for users who wish to engage new\ntechnologies in critical applications. This product design model (prototype-\ntesting-production) is common for manufacturers in most fields (Jones: 1992,\n75).\n\nDespite positive responses from audio experts and record producers,\nSoundstream\u2019s 1976 prototype recorder was ultimately regarded as sonically\ndeficient.^19 Its sampling rate of 37.5 kHz implied a maximum audio frequency\nof 18.75 kHz (in practice, this was closer to 17.5 kHz). Stockham had\ncalculated that this was high enough for most music, but was informed by Jack\nRenner and Robert Woods of the classical recording company, Telarc, that it\nwas not sufficient to capture the complete frequency range of the human ear\nnecessary to achieve so-called \u2018audiophile\u2019 quality recordings.^20 Recognised\nfor their attention to engineering and audio quality, Renner and Woods\nrecorded extensively with Soundstream in the late 1970s.^21 Renner made the\nfollowing entry in a Telarc newsletter: \u2018October 1977: We met with Thomas\nStockham and heard a demo of his digital recorder. While very impressive\nsounding, the cut-off in frequency response above 17.5 kHz bothers us. Dr.\nStockham agrees to extend the upper limit beyond 21 kHz if we will agree to do\na major project\u2019 (Renner: 1992b).\n\nUltimately, Soundstream had to modify the technical specifications of its\nrecorder and offer a sampling rate 12.5 kHz higher than the original estimate\nbefore Telarc would accept that the recordings had the \u2018air\u2019 they were\nmissing.^22 As a prominent recording engineer, Renner\u2019s request was a powerful\nincentive for the company and helped to initiate an upgrade of the Soundstream\nmachine. In August 1977, Soundstream built a four-track recorder that would\nsample at 42.5 kHz and this was quickly upgraded to 50hHz.^23 The sound\nquality of the four-track machine was a significant advance over the two-track\nmodel. It was also now possible to record two tracks in addition to the\nstandard stereo, thus enabling some mixing to occur. The first sessions with\nthe four-track model were with organist Virgil Fox playing the 116-rank\nRuffati organ in Garden Grove Community Church, California, August 28-31,\n1977. Again, the Soundstream system was intended as a backup for the primary\nrecording method, which was direct-to-disc. The resulting records, The Fox\nTouch: Volume One (1977, Crystal Clear Records, CCS7001) and The Fox Touch:\nVolume Two (1977, Crystal Clear Records, CCS7002) were pressed from the\ndirect-to-disc lacquers. The Soundstream digital masters were released from\n1981 onwards once it was discovered that the direct-to-disc masters had\ndeteriorated.^24 On April 4-5, 1978, Soundstream made the first \u2018audiophile\u2019\ncommercial digital recording of an orchestra in the United States when they\nrecorded the Cleveland Symphonic Winds at Severance Hall for the Telarc\nlabel.^25 Eddy (2005) notes that World Book Encyclopedia\u2019s 1978 yearbook\ndescribed the recording as \u2018the bass drum heard \u2018round the world\u2019 due to the\ndynamic bass drum sounds captured in Holst\u2019s suites.\n\nThrough its relationships with Telarc and other classical labels, Soundstream\nwas able to field test its recorder under real world conditions. Evidently,\nclients within the sound recording and music industries will not typically\nallow a prototype recorder to become the primary recording system without\nrigorous testing. In this case, the Soundstream recorder was tested as a\nbackup solution with the opportunity to make comparisons with the analogue\nmaster recordings after the fact. In many cases, the Soundstream recordings\neventually became the primary masters used for release either because of their\nfidelity, or in some cases, because of their durability. This case shows one\nexample of how a prototypical technology was adopted as a secondary tool in\nsupport of an extant primary tool and superseded the primary tool over time.\nAcceptance within user communities is often expedited by the tendency for\nusers to suggest or carry out modifications and upgrades to equipment\n(Lindsay: 2003; Perlman: 2004). User feedback can guide companies into\noperating in particular spaces that are more advantageous to them\neconomically. In the case of Soundstream, this \u2018beta-testing\u2019 process involved\nmodifying the sound quality of their recorder resulting in the opportunity to\nrecord internationally renowned orchestras in world-class concert halls; a\nseries of activities that furthered the widespread acceptance of classical\nmusic in the digital format.^26\n\n### Finding a market\n\nSoundstream Inc. premiered its prototype digital recorder at the 55^th Audio\nEngineering Society convention during October 1976 in New York City (Warnock:\n1976). By 1976, analogue recording had become a sophisticated multi-track\nmedium. With Soundstream\u2019s prototype digital recorder capable of recording\nonly two tracks at a time, it was ironic that innovations in digital\ntechnology would enforce a brief return to stereophonic ensemble recording. As\na result, digital recording was immediately popular with classical music\ncompanies that wanted to achieve ultra high quality stereophonic reproduction\nof the concert hall environment. A discography (Soundstream: 1982) published\nas part of the company\u2019s promotional materials confirms that Soundstream\u2019s\nearliest clients were classical labels such as Telarc, Varese Sarabande, Delos\nand Chalfont. According to Jules Bloomenthal, during the late 1970s,\napproximately 50% of all classical music that was recorded digitally used\nSoundstream equipment.^27 This claim is supported by Ranada\u2019s (1980) article,\nA Dozen Digital Demo Discs, in which he recommends twelve of the finest\ndigitally recorded LPs on the market; ten of the selections were recorded on\nSoundstream equipment.^28\n\nThere has been a tendency for new technologies to achieve widespread\nacceptance in contexts where their limitations do not apply or can be\nexploited in ways that were not necessarily intended by the designer (Jones:\n1992; Th\u00e9berge: 1997; Milner: 2009). In terms of this case study, the\nSoundstream system was inherently compatible with the recording of classical\nmusic for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was portable and reliable on\nlocation at concert halls around the world. Secondly, Soundstream\u2019s analogue\ncircuitry was transformerless, permitting a low noise floor and wide dynamic\nrange, ideal for both delicate musical passages and thunderous crescendos.^29\nThirdly, an orchestral ensemble is balanced or \u2018mixed\u2019 by the conductor using\nthe dynamics of the live performance, the acoustics of the auditorium and by\nthe recording engineer who positions the microphones. Consequently, a pair of\nstereo tracks was often all that was required to achieve the ideal\nreproduction.\n\nDespite a small number of favourable magazine articles (Easton: 1976;\nPenchansky: 1977) and a growing reputation among producers of classical music,\nSoundstream\u2019s staff was by and large made up of computer scientists, not sales\npeople. The most prominent discourse about Soundstream and its services was to\nbe found in presentations/papers by Soundstream staff for the Journal of the\nAudio Engineering Society and its annual conferences (Ingebretsen: 1977;\nStockham: 1977). These were often highly technical accounts populated with\nsampling theory and mathematical calculations. Unlike the marketing campaigns\nthat preceded consumer audio innovations such as the compact disc (Milner:\n2009, 218), Soundstream was not adept at marketing its recording equipment to\nthe audio industry. The cost of the machine was also a prohibitive factor.\nJules Bloomenthal was able to produce a receipt from October 1981 that\ndetailed the sale of a Soundstream recording system to the New York Institute\nof Technology for $65,000.^30 Given the expense of building the machines, a\nhandful of sales would not be enough to sustain the business.\n\n> It became clear shortly after developing our four-channel machine that\n> recording companies would not buy it, mostly because of its price. Our raw\n> parts were between $40,000 and $45,000. Plus, record companies were\n> concerned they wouldn\u2019t be able to maintain the machines. So, we quickly\n> decided to become a service company, renting our machines \u2013 always operated\n> by us \u2013 doing editing and mastering.^31\n\nMilner\u2019s (2009, 308) account of the introduction of the Linn drum machine, the\nFairlight synthesiser and the Synclavier synthesiser establishes similar\nthemes and lays the \u2018conceptual groundwork\u2019 for the modern \u2018Pro Tooled\u2019 world.\nIn this case, emerging sampling instruments were adopted and widely used by\nwealthy pop artists because their high price tags (at least $25,000 for the\nbasic Fairlight system in the mid 1970s) made them inaccessible to the mass\nmarket.\n\nBloomenthal notes that a total of eighteen recorders were built, eight to ten\nof which remained in use.^32 The remaining machines were sold to Telarc,\nDelos, RCA, Paramount Pictures and the Department of Justice, for use by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who had a need for reliable, high\nquality, low-speed location recording. In the short term, for recording\nengineers and producers, digital systems necessitated a new set of working\npractices, increased costs, and the fear of highly complex technical or\nmaintenance issues. Recordists had to rethink approaches to gain structure,\nequalization (EQ), mixing, processing, editing, copying, storage and\nreproduction in this new environment (Warner: 2003, 22). This rapidly\ndeveloping field gave rise to new possibilities, but also introduced\nconstraints on established working practices. Soundstream\u2019s clients preferred\na different way of working, one that required the presence of Soundstream\ntechnicians as intermediaries alongside engineers, producers and artists. As a\nresult, Soundstream adapted its business model and focused on providing\ndigital recording, editing and mastering services, sending its operators and\nequipment to concert halls and recording studios worldwide.\n\nRich Feldman acted primarily as Soundstream\u2019s representative based in Los\nAngeles, travelling with the equipment and operating it during recording\nsessions. He notes that the company became very busy once they established\nthis mode of operation: \u2018the amount of records that I did in the amount of\ntime I worked there is staggering. I went to London, Mexico and worked with\njust about every major orchestra in the United States. I worked with Delos,\nChalfont, Telarc and a bunch of other labels.\u2019^33\n\nSoundstream engineer Bruce Rothaar describes the ways in which Soundstream\nadapted to the role of mobile record engineering: \u2018we built a small fleet of\nrecorders and charged something like $15,000 to bring the equipment to a\nstudio, set it up, do the recording, editing and mastering.\u2019^34 At this price,\nclients who wanted to record commercial albums could justify the expense\nwithout any of the burdens of purchasing the digital equipment. Feldman notes\nthat the routine for Soundstream\u2019s mobile operators was as follows:\n\u2018Soundstream would rent a station wagon. I\u2019d pick the equipment up at the\nairport and take it to the session, do the session and ship the equipment\nback. I would travel wherever they needed me to travel.\u2019^35 The cost of\ndeveloping and manufacturing new technologies can mean that products are very\nexpensive when introduced. As a result, users are sometimes hesitant to invest\nin new technologies, especially if they necessitate a steep learning curve or\nfeature a proprietary system that might be difficult to maintain without\nsupport.\n\nWhile the opportunities available to designers of new technologies are often\nnot as predicted or hoped, Soundstream succeeded in finding a market through\ntheir willingness to adapt and to respond to feedback. Technology companies\ncan help to speed the take up of new technologies through embracing a culture\nof excellence in engineering and quality control. This in turn can change the\nculture of how particular tools are used, understood and talked about within\nuser communities or domestic spaces (Keightley: 1996; 2003; Lindsay: 2003).\nAlthough the company could not have known at the time, the sound recording and\nmusic industries were to enjoy an inexorable march towards increasingly\ninexpensive digital recording systems. As Moorefield, writing in 2010, notes:\n\u2018a recording console which cost $150,000 in 1995 can now be had for about\n$2,000\u2019 (2010, xvii). By the late 1990s, companies such as Digidesign were\noffering a 24-bit, 48-track version of the Pro Tools system with built in\nsequencing capabilities. Pro Tools, a descendant of the Soundstream DAW model,\nachieved a high degree of penetration into professional recording studios\nworldwide and transformed the affordability of home studio systems (Milner:\n2009, 338).\n\nDespite the popularity of the Soundstream machine with producers of classical\nmusic, the recorder remained largely incompatible with the recording practices\nof rock and pop musicians who were accustomed to the extensive overdubbing\nfacilities offered by analogue multi-track tape systems. Nevertheless, some\nrock musicians did experiment with Soundstream equipment. In the late 1970s,\nFleetwood Mac became one of the first rock bands to use the Soundstream\nrecorder on Tusk (1979) and Fleetwood Mac Live (1980). However, as Soundstream\nengineer Bruce Rothaar notes, this was not a recording process as such, but a\ndigital mastering process, making stereo mix masters from an analogue multi-\ntrack.^36 As with the classical music producers who used digital recording\nsystems as a backup to established solutions, rock and pop artists also\nemployed the equipment at less critical junctures in the recording chain,\ntypically as a method of saving on generations of tape copies.\n\nRich Feldman notes that the editing facilities offered by the Soundstream\nsystem also did not appear to be a necessity for rock and pop musicians:\n\n> I gave demos to a bunch of different bands. Nobody bit. They really didn\u2019t\n> need the Soundstream sample-precise digital editing on computer. The only\n> people that needed that were the classical people because they wanted to\n> create \u201cperfect\u201d performances.^37\n\nHere, Feldman draws out debates around the impact of technology on the\naesthetics of recorded music and the reluctance of some engineers and\nmusicians to adopt new recording platforms solely to take advantage of new\nfeatures such as sample-accurate editing or improved technical specifications.\nBloomenthal recalls that Soundstream staff were dismayed that some people\npreferred analogue audio with all of its \u2018imperfections\u2019:\n\n> It seemed to satisfy every audio engineer we worked with, except those that,\n> for reasons we considered quite irrational, categorically rejected the\n> notion of digital audio. These engineers felt that a digital representation\n> of sound would be inherently unmusical. The Rolling Stones, so we were told,\n> decided against use of digital in the early \u201880s, because they felt the\n> grittiness of analogue recording was part of their sound.^38\n\nWhile the advantages of digital recording may have been obvious for those\nseeking to produce orchestral recordings for a classical music audience,\nSoundstream had not predicted the reactions of users who might wish to\npreserve their analogue sound for aesthetic reasons. Simon Frith (1996, 25)\nhas stated that during the introduction of the compact disc, its detractors\nargued that \u2018digital sound storage was actually \u201cunfaithful\u201d to those musical\nforms (like rock n\u2019roll) which were essentially \u201cimpure\u201d\u2019. If we agree that,\nin a practical sense, sound only exists in a recorded form, then as Frith\nsays, \u2018the distinction between the noise that is necessary and the noise that\nis unneccesary...is an aesthetic as well as a technical judgement\u2019 (1996,\n235). Indeed, it was not only musicians who demonstrated their commitment to\nthese kinds of aesthetic decisions, but also recording engineers (Sax and\nArchibald: 1983). The most vocal opponent of these advances at the time was\nDoug Sax of Sheffield Lab, a highly respected mastering engineer and an expert\nin direct-to-disk vinyl recordings. Greg Milner devotes a few pages to this\nperiod in his book Perfecting Sound Forever (2009, 206), noting that Sax\nhelped form a group known as M.A.D (Musicians Against Digital). Sax was\nextremely critical of what he perceived to be weaknesses in digital audio,\nespecially the sound of early compact discs in the early 1980s.^39 Perhaps\nless scientifically, Milner\u2019s book also recounts the tale of the New York\npsychiatrist, John Diamond, who stated that listening to digital recordings\nhad a debilitating effect on human beings. Diamond demonstrated this in\nseveral public demonstrations with volunteers whilst alternating between\nanalogue and digital sound sources.\n\nAs the production of popular music has moved into the multi-track era and now\nthe digital era, the time taken to make recordings has increased. For\nclassical producers, recording a live performance to a pair of stereo tracks\nusing a digital recorder was an efficient way to achieve pristine recordings.\nFor those seeking to experiment with overdubbing and layering large numbers of\ntracks, early digital recorders were often not the ideal technical or sonic\nsolution. However, it must also be noted that some groups of users will reject\nnew technologies outright, either for aesthetic reasons, or more frequently\nbecause they signal the forthcoming redundancy of particular professional\nskills (Sax and Archibald: 1983). It is within these kinds of contexts that\nthe ongoing negotiations, concerning what is possible (and desirable)\neconomically, creatively and culturally, take place.\n\nIn addition to sonic and aesthetic considerations, for the computer scientists\nat Soundstream, the culture of rock and pop lifestyles also proved\nincompatible with their way of working. Bruce Rothaar edited Fleetwood Mac\u2019s\nrecordings and discovered that rock musicians did not necessarily appreciate\nthat the digital editing had to take place in Utah. He notes: \u2018Fleetwood Mac\nflew to Salt Lake City for the editing session. There was pressure to get the\nediting completed by four a.m. so they could be in their Lear Jet, over the\nGrand Canyon, on drugs, at dawn.\u2019^40 When asked about using the Soundstream\nequipment, Fleetwood Mac\u2019s recording engineer Ken Caillat responded: \u2018it\nworked great, except that we had to fly in to Utah to edit.\u2019^41 Rich Feldman\nconcurs that this was not a practical solution for high profile rock clients,\nnoting: \u2018for them it was a pain.\u2019^42\n\nJones (1992, 47) has identified three possible motives behind the user\nacceptance of a particular medium. They are: cost, realism and editing.\nSoundstream provided a powerful way to capture and preserve the space and time\nof musical events, however, for some in the sound recording and music\nindustries, the cost of the machine was perceived to be too high. Despite the\nfact that the equipment provided sample accurate random access editing, the\nlack of portability of the editing suite was also perceived as a weakness.\nExamples such as these indicate some of the ways in which political, economic,\ncultural and aesthetic interests impact upon the professional take up of new\ntechnologies. In some cases, technologies that become consumer standards, for\nwhatever reason \u2013 be it convenience, marketing penetration etc \u2013 fall below\nthe specifications of already available technologies, outmoding the more\nadvanced technologies before they can achieve widespread adoption (Immink:\n1998; Lipshitz: 1998). This kind of evidence maintains continuity with a long\nhistory of resistance (for aesthetic, professional and commercial reasons) to\ndisruptive technologies like the printing press, the radio and the VCR among\nothers (Keller: 2008, 140).\n\n### Competition and demise\n\nIn 1978, a digital multi-track machine manufactured by 3M entered the\nmarketplace.^43 Like Soundstream\u2019s DTR, 3M\u2019s recorder was a 16-bit recorder\nwhich sampled at 50 kHz. Data was stored on one-inch digital tape running at\n45 inches-per-second (ips). 3M delivered a two-track (stereo) prototype of its\ndigital recording system to producer/engineer Tom Jung at Sound 80 studios,\nalso based in Minnesota.^44 Fine (2008, 9) notes that in June 1978, the\nrecorder was used to capture the first Grammy award-winning digital recording,\nCopland: Appalachian Spring / Ives: Three Places in New England (1978, S80,\nDLR-101), featuring conductor Dennis Russell Davies and the St. Paul Chamber\nOrchestra.^45\n\nWith the success of the prototype, 3M went on to develop a 32-track model.\nAccording to Jones (1992, 43): \u2018the deck was a 32-track system using tape,\nwith a cost of $150,000.\u2019 With its extensive multi-track facilities, the 3M\nmachine more closely targeted the needs of rock and pop musicians and was\nadopted by those artists and labels that possessed the necessary financial\nresources and a desire to experiment with digital multi-tracking in the\nrecording studio.^46 Notable examples include guitarist Ry Cooder, who used\nthe 3M recorder to make the first all-digital pop record Bop Till You Drop\n(1979, Warner Bros., 7599-27398-2) and Donald Fagen of Steely Dan, who\nrecorded The Nightfly (1982, Warner Bros., 7599-23696-2) with this system.\n\nWith major label support for 3M\u2019s technology, Soundstream was aware that the\ncompany represented significant competition. However, they could not afford to\ndevelop competing multi-track recorders. Bloomenthal confirms that Soundstream\nwas limited to the four-track recorder because \u2018anything greater would\u2019ve been\nprohibitively expensive to build\u2019.^47 Bloomenthal believes that the quality of\nStockham\u2019s original design was the key to their ongoing operation during this\nperiod of intense competition: \u2018it was more portable than the 3M multi-track,\nvery reliable, had superior editing, superior error-correction and superior\nquality control.\u2019^48 Although Bloomenthal could be accused of bias in this\nregard, Jung\u2019s comments in Lander (2004) support Bloomenthal\u2019s assertions that\nthe 3M machine was a less robust design:\n\n> Nothing was soldered. Herbie (the 3M) was a machine with a mind of its own.\n> You just hoped that if you recorded a good tape it would play back without\n> glitches, but sometimes it didn\u2019t. Oftentimes it would just make a horrible\n> noise in the middle of a playback, so you\u2019d have to start over (Jung cited\n> in Lander: 2004).^49\n\nIn addition to sample-accurate editing and high-resolution sound quality, the\nSoundstream recorder proved to be extremely reliable. Each of the four audio\nchannels of the DTR were fully, independently error-correctable against\ndigital \u2018drop-outs\u2019.^50 According to Bloomenthal, they would typically measure\n\u2018between one and three recoverable drop-outs per thirty minutes of\nrecording.\u2019^51 The four-channel DTR used eight tape tracks, two for each audio\nchannel, each reading redundant data. If a drop-out occurred on one track, the\nDTR switched to the other track. Since drop-outs don\u2019t distribute themselves\nvertically on tape, this method proved to be completely reliable. With the\nexception of a loss of 31 samples on an early recording for the Delos label,\nBloomenthal confirms that their redundant data on tape never failed to\ncompletely recover from an error.^52 It is a testament to the integrity of the\nmachine\u2019s design that Bloomenthal is able to recall the precise number of\nsamples that were lost and eventually spliced out digitally.\n\nAs Theb\u00e9rge (1997, 153) has noted, a continuous flow of capital is required to\nbring any technology to its full development. He suggests that \u2018the ultimate\ntest of a product in the synthesiser or music software industry today is not\nits technical excellence but its market success.\u2019 The reliability of the\nSoundstream DTR undoubtedly helped speed the uptake of digital technology as a\nprimary recording medium. However, as this research demonstrates, products\ndemonstrating quality control issues can still achieve comparable levels of\nmarket penetration due to other factors, such as additional features or\ncommercial support from large companies. Indeed, competition grew as other\nproducts emerged. Comparable systems, such as the Mitsubishi X-80 for example,\nwere adopted by a number of professional recording engineers. Companies such\nas Sony, Technics and dbx made PCM adapters such as the PCM-F1 (1981) for\nvideo units to enable digital recording in the home, whilst other formats like\nProDigi, DASH and ADAT followed on.\n\nIn 1980, Soundstream merged with Digital Recording Corporation (DRC) and\nbecame DRC/Soundstream. Together they developed a consumer digital player that\nused an optical card to store music.^53 Soundstream editor Sydney Davis notes:\n\u2018they owned a business card style memory device that would play back the 1812\nOverture at 50 kHz.\u2019^54 In an effort to expand, Soundstream also opened an\nediting facility at Paramount Pictures in Hollywood and one at Bertelsmann in\nGermany. However, this work was abandoned when the compact disc, developed by\nSony and Phillips, became the mass-market consumer choice (Fine: 2008, 1-2).\nPhilosophically and financially, the introduction of the compact disc was a\nproblem for the company because it brought about the redundancy of\nSoundstream\u2019s optical card based home playback technology and because\nSoundstream staff regarded the standard 44.1 kHz sampling rate as audibly\ninferior to their catalogue of 50 kHz masters. Although equipment was\ndeveloped that allowed for recordings made at 50 kHz to be converted during\ntransfer to the standard mastering consoles of the time, such as the Sony\n1600, Soundstream editor Sydney Davis recalls: \u2018we couldn\u2019t compete against\nSony. We lost the high end of all that stuff because they brought it down to\n44.1 kHz. That was my first experience of what I would consider a technical\ntragedy.\u2019^55 As a result, Soundstream ceased to operate in 1983.\n\nThis section has demonstrated some of the ways in which competition can\ntransform the opportunities available to designers and users of new\ntechnologies. That a Soundstream staff member would characterise the\nwidespread acceptance of the 16-bit/44.1 kHz compact disc format as a\n\u2018tragedy\u2019 reveals a great deal about how Soundstream staff members thought\nabout and understood the work they were doing during that time. Of course,\ncompanies will spend vast amounts of money to develop products that offer\nsimilar functionality to the offerings of their competitors and this kind of\nactivity can push technology forward rapidly. However, in some cases, products\ndeveloped in this way are less robust and this can have a negative effect on\nthe overall reputation of a new technology (Lander: 2004). Accounts such as\nthese also illustrate the broader ways in which consumer technologies\nfrequently do not represent the most advanced solutions available, but instead\nthe most convenient, or those produced by companies with extensive financial\nbacking from major corporations. These sorts of \u2018wars\u2019 for dominance in the\nmarketplace are played out repeatedly, especially with consumer formats such\nas Betamax vs VHS, CD vs SACD, or HD-DVD vs Blu-Ray (Brookey: 2007). The\nintroduction of new technologies to the sound recording and music industries\nis an activity that can be viewed as a confluence of all of the\nafforementioned political economic and cultural forces. Perhaps Durant (1990,\n175) said it best, when he described a \u2018new kind of digital musical culture,\nor interlocking set of conditions and relations in which the sounds of music\nare produced, circulate and are understood\u2019.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nDuring the 1970s, computer scientists and electrical engineers designed\ndigital recorders and assembled them according to the imagined needs of the\nuser. These recording technologies presented constraints that had to be\nnegotiated by engineers, producers and artists in order to achieve high\nquality productions. Sound engineers in the field gave feedback to designers,\nestablishing new recording paradigms and improving sound quality. This article\nhas argued that the design of new technologies and the ways in which they\nbecome embedded in the working practices of users evolves through complicated\nrelationships negotiated over time in response to critical feedback and\nopportunities afforded by the political economic and cultural milieu. Through\nthe experiences of the designers and developers involved, this case study of\nSoundstream has illustrated the complexities of these relationships, described\nthe sorts of challenges faced, and raised a number of questions about the take\nup of new technologies.\n\nSoundstream is important to the modern sound recording and music industries\nbecause it was the first company of its kind in the United States. Soundstream\noriginated the modern DAW and several of its key features, including major\nadvances in random access digital editing and cross-fades. With its attention\nto quality control issues, Soundstream highlighted the importance of error\ncorrection, setting the gold standard for symphonic recordings. Although\nSoundstream did not achieve mass-market success with its products, or gain\nnotable traction in the popular music industry, its work helped to bring about\nthe widespread acceptance of audio production and consumption in the digital\nformat. Digital audio recording and editing brought down barriers to access\nand transformed existing technologies, such as analogue recording, into the\nstandards of previous eras. The transformative effects of digital audio on the\nsound recording and music industries, resulting from its low cost and its\npowerful feature set, are still being experienced in the present day. While\nthis transition into the modern era has been disruptive for many\npractitioners, the general tropes of business, innovation, marketing and\ncompetition have remained continuous.\n\nThis case study has shown that the specifications of new technologies are not\ndetermined entirely by designers and manufacturers, but that the agency of the\nuser can be a key ingredient in the development of such tools. User feedback\nnot only helps to make technologies more useful to their intended market, but\nalso can influence the commercial viablility of a product. The take up of new\ntechnologies by professionals can be a slow process in which new equipment is\ngradually integrated with extant technologies. It is not always the highest\nstandards available that become widely adopted by users, but other factors,\nsuch as cost, convenience and accessibility play important roles. Resistance\nto new technologies is not always motivated by the preservation of technical\nstandards, but can also be about the protection of established professional\nskills, services and livelihoods.\n\nBetween 1975-1980, Soundstream created an archive of almost 200 digital\nmasters. This indicates that, despite their lack of marketing power,\nSoundstream was ultimately successful in convincing the music industries that\ndigital was the dominant format of the future. As Jules Bloomenthal has\nsuggested, Dr. Stockham\u2019s credentials and his focus on audio quality issues\n(Stockham: 1982; 1987) helped to silence critics and speed the uptake of the\nnew technology. Like many independent business operating in the technology\nsector, although Soundstream found a market for their services, ultimately\nthey could not compete commercially with the larger corporations entering the\nfield. This case study of Soundstream demonstrates that the design and\ndevelopment of new technologies and the marketing of such products to users is\na complicated negotiation shaped by the opportunities available to all\nparties. The future of recording will inevitably be linked to this ongoing\nnegotiation between artists, studio intermediaries, technology and commerce.\nIn different circumstances, the adoption of digital audio as a highly portable\nconsumer format might have come about even more quickly. As Tom Stockham wrote\nin 1977: \u2018it is not outrageous to imagine carrying several hours of music in a\nbox the size of a deck of cards\u2019 (Stockham: 1977, 895).\n\n### About the Author\n\nDr Simon Barber Interactive Cultures Birmingham Centre for Media and Cultural\nResearch Birmingham City University Email: simon.barber@bcu.ac.uk Web:\nhttp://www.interactivecultures.org Tel: +44 (0)121 331 7280\n\n### Notes\n\n1 See Blesser (1978).

There is also a complete 12 CD set The Complete Caruso\n(1990, RCA Records, 82876-60396-2).\n\n9 Gilpin (2004) notes: \u2018early in 1974, Dr. Stockham and other panel members\nreported that the gap was caused by at least five separate erasures and re-\nrecordings, not by a single accidental pressing of the wrong button on a tape\nrecorder as the Nixon White House had suggested.\u2019\n\n10 A sampling rate determines how frequently an analogue signal is measured\nper second during its digital conversion. In this case, a sampling rate of 32\nkHz indicates 32,000 samples per second.\n\n11 Marcus was a jazz saxophonist who recorded and toured with Stan Kenton,\nHerbie Mann and Buddy Rich.\n\n12 Myers and Feinberg (1972) have addressed advances in digital recording\nduring this period. Fine (2008, 3) notes that the first LP made with the Denon\nrecorder was Mozart: String Quartet No. 17 in B flat minor, K. 458 \u2018Hunt\u2019\n(1972, Nippon Columbia, NCC-8501) by the Smetana Quartet. Recorded April\n24-26, 1972 at Aoyama Tower, Tokyo, the resulting album was released in\nOctober 1972.\n\n13 Jules Bloomenthal, engineer, Soundstream, July 19, 2007. Personal\ncommunication.\n\n14 The RP04 drives were large and delicate and used only for editing audio at\nthe Soundstream facility in Utah. They had a capacity of 28 megabytes each,\nwhich allowed for approximately twelve minutes of audio. However, the\ninstrumentation tape (made by Ampex) held 30 minutes of digital audio. The\nHoneywell instrumentation tape drive itself was designed to meet military\nrigour and was consequently very reliable when used for location recording.\n\n15 A \u2018cross-fade\u2019 allows two separate regions of digital audio to be joined\nseamlessly with no audible edit point. Soundstream carried out the first\ndigital cross-fades on a commercial release on the soundtrack album Kings Row\n(1979, Chalfont, SDG-305). See Ingebretsen (1977; 1982).\n\n16 For an overview of its features, see Keene (1982).\n\n17 A criterion for the two-track system was outlined in Warnock (1976).\n\n18 The other commercially released recording that used the 1976 two-track\nprototype was Karen Gibbs\u2019s Window Panes (1977, Romar Productions,\nRPS-107701). This record, produced by Soundstream\u2019s Robert Ingebretsen, was\nrecorded conventionally but mastered digitally.\n\n19 Interview with Jules Bloomenthal: July 20, 2007.\n\n20 The human ear can typically hear from 20-20,000 Hz.\n\n21 Telarc International Corporation is a Cleveland Ohio based record label\nfounded in 1977 by two classically trained musicians and former teachers, Jack\nRenner and Robert Woods. See Levitin (1993a; 1993b).\n\n22 See Scull (1998). \u2018Air\u2019 is usually defined in the audio profession as\nclarity and dimension in the upper registers of a recording.\n\n23 Where both Soundstream and 3M used fixed head tape recording, Japanese\ncompetitors such as JVC and Sony developed machines that sampled at 44.1 kHz,\nusing video recorders to store digital audio. Sony\u2019s PCM 1600, for example,\nused a U-Matic video recorder. Later models such as the Sony 1610 and 1630\nbecame the standard for compact disc mastering. The 44.1 kHz sampling rate was\nchosen as the standard in order to be compatible with video frame rates; see\nDoi (1978) and Lipshitz (1998, 38). It is also more than double the maximum\naudible range of human hearing (20 kHz), in accordance with Nyquist-Shannon\nsampling theorem.\n\n24 They were issued in two volumes as The Digital Fox (1981, Ultragroove,\nUG-9001 and UG-9002). As a result of the delay, these sessions are not\nregarded as the first all-digital commercial recordings released in the United\nStates. As Fine (2008, 3) has noted, the first digital recording for\ncommercial release made in the United States was, in fact, a jazz recording.\nIn November 1977, a series of jazz sessions engineered by Jim McCurdy took\nplace at New York City\u2019s Sound Ideas recording studio. The sessions resulted\nin the first digitally recorded jazz album, saxophonist Archie Shepp\u2019s On\nGreen Dolphin Street (1977, Nippon Columbia, YX-7524), recorded November 28,\n1977 and released in May 1978.\n\n25 Frederick Fennell/Cleveland Symphonic Winds, Holst: Suite Nos. 1 and 2 /\nHandel: Music for Royal Fireworks/ Sousa: Stars: Marches, Fanfares and Others\n(1978, Telarc, 5038).\n\n26 Soundstream collaborated with Telarc for several years, setting the gold\nstandard for symphonic recordings; the earliest of these are described in\nRenner (1992a). See also, Levitin (1991; 1993a; 1993b).\n\n27 Interview with Jules Bloomenthal: July 20, 2007.\n\n28 This conclusion is achieved by cross-referencing the Ranada article with\nthe Soundstream discography.\n\n29 The signal-to-noise ratio exceeded 90 dB with total harmonic distortion as\nlow as \u201392 dB.
