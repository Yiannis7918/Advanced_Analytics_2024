PHP 5.4 to 5.5 . I never had any\nproblems updating PHP before. I follow its development closely and try to\nremove my deprecated functions long before they are officially removed. But\nthis time I was caught off guard. It silently broke part of my website for the\nsilliest reason.\n\nI did the update at night before going to bed and only tested my homepage on\nmy local machine before I turned it off. A few days later, I try to access my\nwebsite and it seems to be broken.\n\n> PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined function json_decode().\n\nJSON decode is not defined? How is that even possible? Was it removed from the\nsource code? I thought maybe I had deleted something by mistake, or the update\nwas interrupted somehow. So I removed PHP and reinstalled it. Nada!\n\nIt was still broken. Maybe this function was deprecated and I am the last man\non earth still trying to use it. There was nothing unusual I could find inside\nphpinfo(). So I went to Google. Well, it looked like I was not alone.\n\n> \u201c[...] if you had upgraded from the version provided by php.net you would\n> not have seen a problem.

In fact, it is still as\namazing in PHP 5.5. The problem is the most childish thing I ever read in my\nlife.\n\nI use Ubuntu as my operating system, and it obeys the Free Software Foundation\ndefinition of Free Software:\n\n> The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).\n\nThis doesn't cause any problem of course, until someone comes in and tries to\nbe funny about it.\n\nJSON, the JavaScript Object Notation format, comes with its own license. And\nit states:\n\n> The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.\n\nAccording to the Free Software Foundation, JSON is not free (even though it is\nfree). It just has this silly statement. But rules are rules, so if you\ndownload your PHP upgrade from any distro obeying this license, JSON support\nwill not be included.\n\nSo what do you do? You install the damn thing manually:\n\n    \n    \n    sudo apt-get install php5-json\n\nIt is at most silly. I never had to do anything when I update my PHP code\nbefore. This one sure reminded me that we are only human, that sometimes we\nfight over stupid things. By the way, removing the json extension caused other\nbugs, so they had to fix that too.\n\nOther than that, PHP 5.5 has some cool new feature that I will not be talking\nabout because you probably don't care. But read here anyway\n\n### Original Bug report:\n\n    \n    \n    Hi, This statement in the JSON extensions source code worries Debian about complience with the Debian free software guide (DFSG). It would be great to remove this paragraph as to be clean the first license paragraph is obviously free software license. ./ext/json/utf8_to_utf16.c:The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil. ./ext/json/JSON_parser.c:The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil. ./ext/json/utf8_decode.c:The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil. ./README.REDIST.BINS:The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.\n\nResources:\n\n  * JSON extension includes a problematic license statement\n  * Stackoverflow\n\nDid you like this article?

These methods are\ndeprecated and slow. The time to upgrade has long passed yet we still see it\neverywhere. Since I cannot force every author to update their tutorial and\nblogs, I decided to write a post to hopefully rank better and provide the\nessential information to help new comers.\n\n### Getting started with your first Website\n\nMaking your own website shouldn't be too difficult. Hosting companies like\nGodaddy or Hostgator make it super easy for anyone to get started; they allow\nyou to create a whole website without ever writing code. For most people, it\nis plenty to run a WordPress blog. If this is what you are looking for you\nshould head to Godaddy.com right now. We are done here. But on the other hand,\nif you want to have control and not be limited by the short comings of a\nshared hosting without busting your wallet, you have come to the right place.\n\n### Vim text editor: Getting started\n\nVim is my favorite text editor on the terminal. After playing for a little\nwhile with nano and emacs, I finally settled with vim for its simplicity (bare\nwith me please). Although it can be customized and used like an entire IDE, I\nuse it mostly for editing files on my servers and making small but crucial\nchanges. Let's not get into Editor war and get started.\n\nView all articles\n\n### Comments\n\nThere are no comments added yet.\n\n#### Let's hear your thoughts\n\n### About Me\n\nFirst of all, Wow!
