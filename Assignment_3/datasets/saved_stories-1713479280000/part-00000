News Blog\n\n# Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3 Opus model is now available on Amazon Bedrock\n\nby Channy Yun | on 16 APR 2024 | in Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI, Launch, News | Permalink | Comments | Share\n\nWe are living in the generative artificial intelligence (AI) era; a time of\nrapid innovation. When Anthropic announced its Claude 3 foundation models\n(FMs) on March 4, we made Claude 3 Sonnet, a model balanced between skills and\nspeed, available on Amazon Bedrock the same day. On March 13, we launched the\nClaude 3 Haiku model on Amazon Bedrock, the fastest and most compact member of\nthe Claude 3 family for near-instant responsiveness.\n\nToday, we are announcing the availability of Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3 Opus on\nAmazon Bedrock, the most intelligent Claude 3 model, with best-in-market\nperformance on highly complex tasks. It can navigate open-ended prompts and\nsight-unseen scenarios with remarkable fluency and human-like understanding,\nleading the frontier of general intelligence.\n\nWith the availability of Claude 3 Opus on Amazon Bedrock, enterprises can\nbuild generative AI applications to automate tasks, generate revenue through\nuser-facing applications, conduct complex financial forecasts, and accelerate\nresearch and development across various sectors. Like the rest of the Claude 3\nfamily, Opus can process images and return text outputs.\n\nClaude 3 Opus shows an estimated twofold gain in accuracy over Claude 2.1 on\ndifficult open-ended questions, reducing the likelihood of faulty responses.\nAs enterprise customers rely on Claude across industries like healthcare,\nfinance, and legal research, improved accuracy is essential for safety and\nperformance.\n\nHow does Claude 3 Opus perform? Claude 3 Opus outperforms its peers on most of\nthe common evaluation benchmarks for AI systems, including undergraduate-level\nexpert knowledge (MMLU), graduate-level expert reasoning (GPQA), basic\nmathematics (GSM8K), and more. It exhibits high levels of comprehension and\nfluency on complex tasks, leading the frontier of general intelligence.\n\nSource: https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family\n\nHere are a few supported use cases for the Claude 3 Opus model:\n\n  * Task automation: planning and execution of complex actions across APIs, databases, and interactive coding\n  * Research: brainstorming and hypothesis generation, research review, and drug discovery\n  * Strategy: advanced analysis of charts and graphs, financials and market trends, and forecasting\n\nTo learn more about Claude 3 Opus\u2019s features and capabilities, visit\nAnthropic\u2019s Claude on Bedrock page and Anthropic Claude models in the Amazon\nBedrock documentation.\n\nClaude 3 Opus in action If you are new to using Anthropic models, go to the\nAmazon Bedrock console and choose Model access on the bottom left pane.\nRequest access separately for Claude 3 Opus.\n\nTo test Claude 3 Opus in the console, choose Text or Chat under Playgrounds in\nthe left menu pane. Then choose Select model and select Anthropic as the\ncategory and Claude 3 Opus as the model.\n\nTo test more Claude prompt examples, choose Load examples. You can view and\nrun examples specific to Claude 3 Opus, such as analyzing a quarterly report,\nbuilding a website, and creating a side-scrolling game.\n\nBy choosing View API request, you can also access the model using code\nexamples in the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and AWS SDKs. Here is a\nsample of the AWS CLI command:\n\n    \n    \n    aws bedrock-runtime invoke-model \\ --model-id anthropic.claude-3-opus-20240229-v1:0 \\ --body \"{\\\"messages\\\":[{\\\"role\\\":\\\"user\\\",\\\"content\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"text\\\",\\\"text\\\":\\\" Your task is to create a one-page website for an online learning platform.\\\\n\\\"}]}],\\\"anthropic_version\\\":\\\"bedrock-2023-05-31\\\",\\\"max_tokens\\\":2000,\\\"temperature\\\":1,\\\"top_k\\\":250,\\\"top_p\\\":0.999,\\\"stop_sequences\\\":[\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHuman:\\\"]}\" \\ --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \\ --region us-west-2 \\ invoke-model-output.txt\n\nBash\n\nAs I mentioned in my previous Claude 3 model launch posts, you need to use the\nnew Anthropic Claude Messages API format for some Claude 3 model features,\nsuch as image processing. If you use Anthropic Claude Text Completions API and\nwant to use Claude 3 models, you should upgrade from the Text Completions API.\n\nMy colleagues, Dennis Traub and Francois Bouteruche, are building code\nexamples for Amazon Bedrock using AWS SDKs. You can learn how to invoke Claude\n3 on Amazon Bedrock to generate text or multimodal prompts for image analysis\nin the Amazon Bedrock documentation.\n\nHere is sample JavaScript code to send a Messages API request to generate\ntext:\n\n    \n    \n    // claude_opus.js - Invokes Anthropic Claude 3 Opus using the Messages API. import { BedrockRuntimeClient, InvokeModelCommand } from \"@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime\"; const modelId = \"anthropic.claude-3-opus-20240229-v1:0\"; const prompt = \"Hello Claude, how are you today?\"; // Create a new Bedrock Runtime client instance const client = new BedrockRuntimeClient({ region: \"us-west-2\" }); // Prepare the payload for the model const payload = { anthropic_version: \"bedrock-2023-05-31\", max_tokens: 1000, messages: [{ role: \"user\", content: [{ type: \"text\", text: prompt }] }] }; // Invoke Claude with the payload and wait for the response const command = new InvokeModelCommand({ contentType: \"application/json\", body: JSON.stringify(payload), modelId }); const apiResponse = await client.send(command); // Decode and print Claude's response const decodedResponseBody = new TextDecoder().decode(apiResponse.body); const responseBody = JSON.parse(decodedResponseBody); const text = responseBody.content[0].text; console.log(`Response: ${text}`);\n\nJavaScript\n\nNow, you can install the AWS SDK for JavaScript Runtime Client for Node.js and\nrun claude_opus.js.\n\n    \n    \n    npm install @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime node claude_opus.js\n\nBash\n\nFor more examples in different programming languages, check out the code\nexamples section in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide, and learn how to use system\nprompts with Anthropic Claude at Community.aws.\n\nNow available Claude 3 Opus is available today in the US West (Oregon) Region;\ncheck the full Region list for future updates.\n\nGive Claude 3 Opus a try in the Amazon Bedrock console today and send feedback\nto AWS re:Post for Amazon Bedrock or through your usual AWS Support contacts.\n\n\u2014 Channy\n\n### Channy Yun\n\nChanny Yun is a Principal Developer Advocate for AWS, and passionate about\nhelping developers to build modern applications on latest AWS services.
