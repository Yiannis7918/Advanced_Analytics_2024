Was a monthly British magazine that catered for the Electron,\nBBC Micro, Commodore, Atari ST, Spectrum, Archimedes and Amstrad CPC\n(although, strictly speaking, Issue 1 contained no Amstrad CPC content - from\nIssue 2 it did.). The magazine was 99 pence and only lasted 12 issues (August\n1990 to July 1991).\n\nIt was produced by Database Publications - with the Managing Editor being\nDerek Meakin (from Computing with the Amstrad).The last two issues were\npublished by Europress Publications.\n\nThe magazine covered as much as possible in its 48 pages - game reviews, news,\ncartoons/jokes, reader questions and type-ins. Sometimes the type-ins would\nspecific only to certain platforms, other times they would provide you with\nthe lines to change in order to make it work for your platform.\n\n## Online Issues\n\n  * Issue 1\n  * Issue 2\n  * Issue 3\n  * Issue 4\n  * Issue 5\n  * Issue 6\n  * Issue 7\n  * Issue 8\n  * Issue 9\n  * Issue 10\n  * Issue 11\n  * Issue 12\n\nRetrieved from\n\"https://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php?title=Let%27s_Compute!&oldid=90607\"\n\nCategory:\n\n  * Magazines\n\n## Navigation menu\n\n### Personal tools\n\n  * Create account\n  * Log in\n\n### Namespaces\n\n  * Page\n  * Discussion\n\n### Variants\n\n### Views\n\n  * Read\n  * View source\n  * View history\n\n### More\n\n### Contents\n\n  * Main Page\n  * Random page\n  * Recent changes\n  * CPCWiki portal\n  * Content Categories\n\n### Hardware\n\n  * Amstrad CPC Buyers' Guide for new users\n  * In short\n  * CPC 464/664/6128\n  * CPC+/GX4000\n  * Peripherals\n  * DIY & Repair\n  * Gallery\n\n### Software\n\n  * The Games\n  * Serious software\n  * Programming\n  * Emulators\n\n### Printed matter\n\n  * Books, magazines, technical, manuals\n\n### The Scene\n\n  * Groups/Members\n  * Parties/Events\n  * Links\n\n### Wiki-related\n\n  * Upload file\n  * Upload multi files\n  * Special Pages\n  * About - Contribute\n  * Statistics\n  * Create Page\n  * Editing Help\n  * Discussion forum\n\n### Tools\n\n  * What links here\n  * Related changes\n  * Special pages\n  * Printable version\n  * Permanent link\n  * Page information\n\n  * This page was last modified on 26 August 2014, at 06:20.\n  * Content is available under unless otherwise noted.\n\n  * Privacy policy\n  * About CPCWiki - THE Amstrad CPC encyclopedia!\n  * Disclaimers\n  * Mobile view\n\n", "frontpage": false}
