With the progress we've\nmade refining the features and stability of Android 15, it's time to open the\nexperience up to both developers and early adopters, so you can now enroll any\nsupported Pixel device here to get this and future Android 15 Beta and feature\ndrop Beta updates over-the-air.\n\nAndroid 15 continues our work to build a platform that helps improve your\nproductivity, give users a premium app experience, protect user privacy and\nsecurity, and make your app accessible to as many people as possible \u2014 all in\na vibrant and diverse ecosystem of devices, silicon partners, and carriers.\n\nAndroid delivers enhancements and new features year-round, and your feedback\non the Android beta program plays a key role in helping Android continuously\nimprove. The Android 15 developer site has lots more information about the\nbeta, including downloads for Pixel and the release timeline. We\u2019re looking\nforward to hearing what you think, and thank you in advance for your continued\nhelp in making Android a platform that works for everyone.\n\nWe\u2019ll have lots more to share as we move through the release cycle, and be\nsure to tune into Google I/O where you can dive deeper into topics that\ninterest you with over 100 sessions, workshops, codelabs, and demos.\n\n### Edge-to-edge\n\nApps targeting Android 15 are displayed edge-to-edge by default on Android 15\ndevices. This means that apps no longer need to explicitly call\nWindow.setDecorFitsSystemWindows(false) or enableEdgeToEdge() to show their\ncontent behind the system bars, although we recommend continuing to call\nenableEdgeToEdge() to get the edge-to-edge experience on earlier Android\nreleases.\n\nTo assist your app with going edge-to-edge, many of the Material 3 composables\nhandle insets for you, based on how the composables are placed in your app\naccording to the Material specifications.\n\nOn the left: App targets SDK 34 (Android 14) and is not edge-to-edge on an\nAndroid 15 device. On the right: App targets SDK 35 (Android 15) and is edge-\nto-edge on an Android 15 device. Note the Material 3 TopAppBar is\nautomatically protecting the status bar, which would otherwise be transparent\nby default.\n\nThe system bars are transparent or translucent and content will draw behind by\ndefault. Refer to \"Handle overlaps using insets\" (Views) or Window insets in\nCompose to see how to prevent important touch targets from being hidden by the\nsystem bars.\n\n### Smoother NFC experiences - part 2\n\nAndroid 15 is working to make the tap to pay experience more seamless and\nreliable while continuing to support Android's robust NFC app ecosystem. In\naddition to the observe mode changes from Android 15 developer preview 2, apps\ncan now register a fingerprint on supported devices so they can be notified of\npolling loop activity, which allows for smooth operation with multiple NFC-\naware applications.\n\n### Inter-character justification\n\nStarting with Android 15, text can be justified utilizing letter spacing by\nusing JUSTIFICATION_MODE_INTER_CHARACTER. Inter-word justification was first\nintroduced in Android O, but inter-character solves for languages that use the\nwhite space for segmentation, e.g. Chinese, Japanese, etc.\n\nJUSTIFICATION_MODE_NONE\n\nJUSTIFICATION_MODE_INTER_WORD\n\nJUSTIFICATION_MODE_INTER_CHARACTER\n\n### App archiving\n\nAndroid and Google Play announced support for app archiving last year,\nallowing users to free up space by partially removing infrequently used apps\nfrom the device that were published using Android App Bundle on Google Play.\nAndroid 15 now includes OS level support for app archiving and unarchiving,\nmaking it easier for all app stores to implement it.\n\nApps with the REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES permission can call the PackageInstaller\nrequestArchive method to request archiving a currently installed app package,\nwhich removes the APK and any cached files, but persists user data. Archived\napps are returned as displayable apps through the LauncherApps APIs; users\nwill see a UI treatment to highlight that those apps are archived. If a user\ntaps on an archived app, the responsible installer will get a request to\nunarchive it, and the restoration process can be monitored by the\nACTION_PACKAGE_ADDED broadcast.\n\n### App-managed profiling\n\nAndroid 15 includes the all new ProfilingManager class, which allows you to\ncollect profiling information from within your app. We're planning to wrap\nthis with an Android Jetpack API that will simplify construction of profiling\nrequests, but the core API will allow the collection of heap dumps, heap\nprofiles, stack sampling, and more. It provides a callback to your app with a\nsupplied tag to identify the output file, which is delivered to your app's\nfiles directory. The API does rate limiting to minimize the performance\nimpact.\n\n### Better Braille\n\nIn Android 15, we've made it possible for TalkBack to support Braille displays\nthat are using the HID standard over both USB and secure Bluetooth.\n\nThis standard, much like the one used by mice and keyboards, will help Android\nsupport a wider range of Braille displays over time.\n\n### Key management for end-to-end encryption\n\nWe are introducing the E2eeContactKeysManager in Android 15, which facilitates\nend-to-end encryption (E2EE) in your Android apps by providing an OS-level API\nfor the storage of cryptographic public keys.\n\nThe E2eeContactKeysManager is designed to integrate with the platform contacts\napp to give users a centralized way to manage and verify their contacts'\npublic keys.\n\n### Secured background activity launches\n\nAndroid 15 brings additional changes to prevent malicious background apps from\nbringing other apps to the foreground, elevating their privileges, and abusing\nuser interaction, aiming to protect users from malicious apps and give them\nmore control over their devices. Background activity launches have been\nrestricted since Android 10.\n\n### App compatibility\n\nWith Android 15 now in beta, we're opening up access to early-adopter users as\nwell as developers, so if you haven't yet tested your app for compatibility\nwith Android 15, now is the time to do it. In the weeks ahead, you can expect\nmore users to try your app on Android 15 and raise issues they find.\n\nTo test for compatibility, install your published app on a device or emulator\nrunning Android 15 beta and work through all of your app's flows. Review the\nbehavior changes to focus your testing. After you've resolved any issues,\npublish an update as soon as possible.\n\nTo give you more time to plan for app compatibility work, we\u2019re letting you\nknow our Platform Stability milestone well in advance.\n\nAt this milestone, we\u2019ll deliver final SDK/NDK APIs and also final internal\nAPIs and app-facing system behaviors. We\u2019re expecting to reach Platform\nStability in June 2024, and from that time you\u2019ll have several months before\nthe official release to do your final testing. The release timeline details\nare here.\n\n# Get started with Android 15\n\nToday's beta release has everything you need to try the Android 15 features,\ntest your apps, and give us feedback. Now that we've entered the beta phase,\nyou can enroll any supported Pixel device here to get this and future Android\nBeta updates over-the-air. If you don\u2019t have a Pixel device, you can use the\n64-bit system images with the Android Emulator in Android Studio. If you're\nalready in the Android 14 QPR beta program on a supported device, or have\ninstalled the developer preview, you'll automatically get updated to Android\n15 Beta 1.\n\n> For the best development experience with Android 15, we recommend that you\n> use the latest version of Android Studio Jellyfish (or more recent\n> Jellyfish+ versions). Once you\u2019re set up, here are some of the things you\n> should do:\n>\n>     * Try the new features and APIs - your feedback is critical during the\n> early part of the developer preview and beta program. Report issues in our\n> tracker on the feedback page.\n>\n\n>     * Test your current app for compatibility - learn whether your app is\n> affected by changes in Android 15; install your app onto a device or\n> emulator running Android 15 and extensively test it.\n>\n\nWe\u2019ll update the beta system images and SDK regularly throughout the Android\n15 release cycle.
