Check back here throughout the\nweek for more on the increasingly difficult prospect of making a living as a\nfull-time writer, or subscribe to Dirt to get the series in your inbox.\n\n______________________\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s money I want, or rather the things money will buy; and I can never\npossibly have too much... More money means more life to me. The habit of\nspending money, ah God! I shall always be its victim. If cash comes with fame,\ncome fame; if cash comes without fame, then come cash.\u201d\n\nThis passage is from a letter written by Jack London, most famous for Call of\nthe Wild, in a response to a letter from one of his fans in 1899, a postal\nemployee from California. London spent his life writing everything from novels\nto short stories to reported newspaper features: a committed freelancer. He\nalso frequently wrote about workers, their lives, their struggle as a class,\nand the systems that exploited them.\n\nDespite being enough of a success to have fans writing him letters from post\noffices, the fact is he never earned much money himself. In fact, he actually\ntried to get on as a postal worker at one point in his freelancing career. If\nhe had been hired, he would have joined William Faulkner, Charles Bukowski,\nand Richard Wright as postal workers who became successful writers.\n\nThe post office makes sense as a pit stop for aspiring writers and lunchpail\nfreelancers. At least at one point in history the work came with a lot of down\ntime, so you could write on the clock. More importantly, however, the job came\nwith a fair wage and decent benefits. It\u2019s tough to do your best work when\nyou\u2019re constantly worried about money. It\u2019s even tougher when, like London,\nyou are the victim of the habit of spending it.\n\nI started writing around 2011, not long after my dad died of cancer. I had\njust had my first kid. I was living in a hotel in Selma, Alabama, trying to\nhelp some autoworkers organize a union with the UAW and found out my wife was\npregnant back in New York with our second child. I had been working as a union\norganizer for more than a decade at that point. I had dropped out of college\nin 1999 to go on the road with the clothing workers union stirring up shit\neverywhere from Gun Barrel, Texas to Gun Hill Road in the Bronx. I did that\nwork pretty much non-stop, living out of a suitcase about 200 or more days a\nyear.\n\nAfter a difficult day of driving around the sticks and visiting with\nautoworkers in their homes, I would sit up late at night in the Waffle House\nnear my hotel and write.\n\nBy my early thirties, I had grown weary of life on the road, and life as an\norganizer. It was an exciting life, but also stressful; a life of constant\nconflict. Sometimes to decompress after a difficult day of driving around the\nsticks and visiting with autoworkers in their homes, I would sit up late at\nnight in the Waffle House near my hotel and write. Once I knew another kid was\non the way, I started thinking writing could be a way out.\n\nAs a kid I always wanted to be a writer, though it never felt like something I\ncould realistically do. Writers were important people, I reckoned. They went\nto fancy schools and got MFAs. They interned or spent a year abroad or some\nother such alien nonsense. They all hung out with each other at oaky taverns\nor in collegiate libraries with those green and brass lamps. I didn\u2019t know any\nwriters. It was all just a fantasy.\n\nBut now as a young adult starting a family, the romance of toting my suitcase\nfrom one motel to the next trying to foment revolution was wearing thin. I\nrevisited my adolescent passion, and would daydream about a life sitting in a\nstudy surrounded by books, hard at work on my own, probably on a typewriter,\npatches on my blazer\u2019s elbows, all that shit.\n\nI sent a bunch of stuff I wrote at Waffle House out. I won a writing contest.\nSome things I wrote went viral-ish. The Awl sent me $50 for an essay. Things\nstarted happening! Before I knew it I had a lunch date with an editor at a\npublishing company, and soon after that something the publishing people called\na \u201cgood deal\u201d and more money than I had ever seen in my bank account in my\nlife. I quit my union organizing job because I had a book deal and was on the\nprecipice of an honest to God life of letters.\n\nFive years later I was still working on that book and we were flat broke. As I\nsat in the library, surrounded by books, hard at work on my own, I would\ndaydream of going back to work for the union. Or maybe the post office.\n\nBack in 1981 some researchers at Columbia University\u2019s Center for the Social\nSciences published the findings of perhaps the single most extensive survey of\nAmerican writers. They interviewed over 2,000 writers who had published at\nleast one book, held no other job, and spent more than 25 hours a week\nwriting. Two thirds of them didn\u2019t earn $20,000 a year, which in today\u2019s\ndollars would be roughly $67,000. That may sound like a lot, but it is the\nminimum salary for an entry-level writer in the Writers Guild of America\nEast\u2019s union contract with Hearst. A third of those full time writers didn\u2019t\nearn $5,000 a year, which would be about $16,000 today. They estimated that\nabout half of the authors in America at that time held other jobs or depended\non their spouse\u2019s incomes. Only about 10% of writers were making over what\ntoday would be a six figure salary.\n\nFor many freelance writers, $1 a word is the highest they will ever be paid.\n\nThis survey was put together for the Author\u2019s Guild, a professional\norganization that represents writers of books, and they have conducted their\nown (though far less academically rigorous) survey every year since. It always\nsays the same thing: the vast majority of writers don\u2019t earn enough from\nwriting to make a decent living.\n\nThe same year the Columbia study was published, The Nation magazine held the\nAmerican Writers Congress at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City. The meeting\nwas modeled on similar ones held in the 1930s and early 40s. Thousands of\nwriters came from all over the country to attend, so many in fact the\norganizers had to bar the doors and keep some hopeful attendees outside. The\nattendees included James Baldwin, Kurt Vonnegut, Arthur Miller, Toni Morrison,\nand Denise Levertov, among many other notable names. They bemoaned the fact\nthat there were fewer opportunities for writers to earn a living than ever,\nthat advances and pay and grant money were dwindling, and that writers had\nless control over their working lives than ever before. On the last day of the\nCongress they passed a resolution calling for a union for writers and formed\nthe Organizing Committee for a National Writers Union, which would establish\nthe National Writers Union for freelance writers that same year.\n\nAt the time the NWU was founded, $1 a word was considered a bare-minimum rate\nfor freelance writing. One of their earliest campaigns was to try to raise\nthese rates at alt-weeklies and magazines around the country. By the end of\nthe 1990s, the union was maintaining a public list of places that still paid\n$1 a word as a service to writers. Today it is no longer considered the floor,\nbut a ceiling. For many freelance writers, $1 a word is the highest they will\never be paid. The fledgling union won some mighty battles over the years, but\nultimately were powerless to stop the tidal wave of the internet that created\nmore opportunities to publish writing than ever before, but erased all of the\nways writers used to make even a piddling amount of money at it in the past.\n\nFor the last decade I have served on the board of the National Writers Union,\nand I have met hundreds of writers in every discipline you can think of, from\npoetry to technical writing. It is rare that I meet anyone who makes their\nliving solely from writing books. The few that stand out were people who\nworked in genre: a romance novelist who self published three books a year and\nsold roughly 1,000 copies of each $10 book to her adoring fans; a sci-fi\nwriter who serialized his novel to his 800 Patreon subscribers for $10 a\nmonth.\n\nThe same can be said about journalism. Print magazines, once the top of the\nmarket for freelancers, are disappearing. Once-vaunted names in publishing\nlike Sports Illustrated have been cannibalized by venture capital and private\nequity, purchased for their \u201cbrand\u201d rather than their \u201ccontent,\u201d and one major\ndigital media property after another is folding up shop now as they struggle\nto figure out how to make money on the internet. Hundreds of talented writers\nare left in the wake, scrambling to find a new place to sell their work to.\nThere are at once fewer places to write for decent money and more capable\nfreelance writers than ever before.\n\nLooking back on it now, the idea that a life as a writer would be a path to\nstability and comfort for myself and my young family was utterly absurd. The\nconcept of a writer that I and most non-writers held in our collective\nconsciousness was a myth, a cultural construction informed by a small number\nof relatively famous writers. The truth is, few people can earn a full time\nliving simply writing books. Books take a long time to write, and they don\u2019t\nsell as well as they maybe once did, so the money isn\u2019t great. The majority of\ndeals are under $50,000 (\u201cnice\u201d in publishing parlance), and only around 10%\nof books sell more than 5,000 copies. Most of the profits in publishing come\nfrom a small number of books (and authors). So where do most writers earn a\nliving, if not from the fruits of their creative labor? Well, it depends.\n\nThe concept of a writer that I and most non-writers held in our collective\nconsciousness was a myth, a cultural construction informed by a small number\nof relatively famous writers.\n\nIn my case I toiled part time as the director of a small arts non profit for a\nwhile in order to support my family while my wife took a year-long leave of\nabsence after our third child was born. But when she went back to work (a\nunion job with incredible health benefits) I was able to freelance full time\nto make up my share of the family bills, all while still struggling to finish\nthe book I had already spent all the advance money from. I wrote everything I\ncould get paid for, and I mean everything: essays, longform journalism,\nscreenplays, short fiction, monologue jokes, advertising copy, marketing\nemails, even tweets. I wrote maybe the best thing I\u2019ve ever written in my life\nand sold it (and all rights in perpetuity) to Vice for $100. I did an episode\nof This American Life for $5,000. A guy paid me $500 cash to write his\nacceptance speech when he won an award. Most of what kept us afloat during\nthose years was a contract I was very fortunate to sign that paid me every\nmonth to write mindless copy for a sports website.\n\nA lot of writers I know have scraped together a living this way, cobbling\ntogether dozens of small paychecks throughout the year. Most people, like me,\neither spread themselves out as thinly as possible to afford the writing life,\nor, also like me, rely on a partner\u2019s income and steady paycheck with\nbenefits.\n\nOver the years I\u2019ve seen a lot of my writer friends throw in the towel on\nfreelancing. They would take a job as a staff editor somewhere, or they\u2019d\nleave for L.A. to join the scrum for lucrative TV writing jobs, or they\u2019d go\nback to graduate school, or they\u2019d find a job teaching. Usually these jobs\ndidn\u2019t preclude them from continuing to write books, or to freelance on the\nside. But it was a sign that maybe that was a possibility, because day jobs\nrequire a lot of your bandwidth, and writing a book requires focus. I\u2019d feel\nsome sense of shameful pride as friends would leave the freelance rat race for\na regular-type job, because it meant I hadn\u2019t yet reached that point, and it\nmeant there was still hope I may never have to.\n\nEventually my wife needed to quit her job in a hurry, and we were put in a\ntough spot. I needed a job with health insurance, and I went hat-in-hand to\nevery editor I had ever written for, every person who had ever complimented my\nwork, everyone I knew who was in a position to maybe get me an interview. I\ninterviewed for staff writer positions at newspapers, magazines, websites. I\ninterviewed for copy writing jobs, content farms, teaching gigs. I abandoned\nall pretensions and was willing to do anything I could so long as there was\nhealth insurance provided. Nobody offered me a job. I ended up signing a\ncontract to ghostwrite a book for someone that paid well enough that I could\nbuy some overpriced garbage insurance on the exchange and still pay the bills.\nI was lucky to find that. The person who hooked me up with it was an old\nfriend from my union organizing days, strangely enough.\n\nI was pretty sure this was going to be the end of the road for my writing\nlife. I had three kids. We were renting a place that had mold that I was\npretty sure was making us all sick. I drove a 2010 Ford Escape (that I bought\nwhen I had a car allowance from the UAW) that had 150,000 miles on it and\nleaked when it rained. My partner was encouraging, but I knew that the things\nwe wanted but lacked were my fault. I was making about $35,000 a year before\nexpenses or taxes as a freelancer.\n\nThen the book finally came out. It did well enough, and I was pleased with the\nresponse. But I soon learned the lesson that so many other writers before me\nhave learned: all the real money is out in California. The book was optioned\nfor television in an auction, and even the option money was more than I had\nmade from the book. That\u2019s how wild the money in film and TV was compared to\nthe rest of the arts. Just the money I was paid for an option on the rights\nwas enough to live on. I was unbelievably lucky.\n\nWe bought a house and a new car, figuring this kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen to\npeople like us more than once. Now it\u2019s been a few years and that money has\nrun out, too. I\u2019m working on another book. It\u2019s taking a lot longer than I\nthought it would. The bills are much higher now that we bought that stupid\nhouse and car, so I need to sell even more writing than before. On days where\nI can\u2019t seem to find any inspiration to write, I scan the job postings,\nlooking for a way out.\n\nWriters come in all shapes and sizes, in many and multiple disciplines, and at\nvarious points along the ladder of economic and social class. Writing is work,\nlike anything else, and as such it can provide riches for some, and peanuts\nfor most. Freelance writing, which I suppose is the purest form of the writing\nlife, where one can simply write whatever interests them and sell it to\nwhomever will publish it, is a life of precarity. Just as I fell for the\nromance of a life as a swashbuckling labor agitator in my twenties, I had\nfallen for a similar bullshit idea about the romance of the life of letters.\nThe freelance writer is no different than any other gig worker in our\nfractured, dystopian modern economy. We only eat what we kill.\n\n###### David Hill\n\nDavid Hill is originally from Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he was raised in a\nfamily of carnies, gamblers, hell-raisers and story-tellers.
