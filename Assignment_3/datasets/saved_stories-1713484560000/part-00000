He reflected on the firm's beginnings in 2009, noting that the\nprevailing belief in venture capital was that only 15 companies would generate\n$100 million in revenue each year, driving most VC returns.\n\nAt that time, venture capital firms focused on addressing this limited market,\nleading to smaller fund sizes and fewer partners per fund. A16Z started with a\n$300 million fund and two general partners, aligning with this approach.\n\nHowever, the landscape shifted shortly after the firm's inception, as Marc\nforesaw in his 2011 article, \"Software is Eating the World.\" His predictions\ncame to fruition, with nearly every major business being transformed into a\nsoftware company over the past decade.\n\nNo better time to build a game startup\n\nA16Z partner Jonathan Lai also took to Twitter to share the news of the gaming\nfund where he says \u201cthere\u2019s never been a better time to build a game startup\nthan today.\"\n\n\u201cThere are more players and platforms than ever before \u2014 more tools and tech\nto help build games than ever before \u2014 more funding for game startups than\never before,\" said Lai.\n\nHe adds that the firm prioritizes early-stage founders, often providing\ninitial funding through programs like A16z Games Speedrun. They also offer\nsupport across pre-seed to Series A/B stages and invest in game studios, game\ninfrastructure, and consumer apps related to gaming.\n\nAfter announcing its Speedrun Accelerator with $75 million up for grabs, A16Z\nhas so far invested $1.2 billion into gaming. As Horowitz puts it, \u201cTo best\nserve the market, we created dedicated venture funds, each with its own team\nof experts and capabilities, specifically focused on each segment.\"\n\n\u201cWe did this because we believe as former entrepreneurs that your investors\nreally matter,\" he said.\n\nTags:\n\n  * Investment\n\nIsa Muhammad\n\nStaff Writer\n\nIsa Muhammad is a B2B writer and video games journalist with 5+ years\nexperience covering games, interviewing industry professionals, tracking\nindustry trends and understanding the market.\n\n# Related Articles\n\nNews Apr 2nd, 2024\n\n## A16Z's third Speedrun accelerator is now open with $75 million up for grabs\n\nNews Aug 4th, 2023\n\n## Zibra AI raises $500,000 from a16z Speedrun\n\nNews Aug 2nd, 2023\n\n## a16z Games announces Speedrun 2024 with $75 million investment pool\n\nNews Apr 1st, 2022\n\n## Former Riot Games founded Battlebound raises $4.8 million\n\nNews Apr 18th, 2024\n\n## Auctus Capital Partners and Remote Control to invest in European games\ncompanies\n\nTerms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\n# Top Stories\n\nNews Features\n\nNews 5 hours ago\n\n## Fortis team boosted by top ex-King, PopCap EA, Microsoft and Warner Bros.\nGames talent\n\nNews 6 hours, 51 minutes ago\n\n## UK skills crisis prompts call for games industry-led body to tackle key\nchallenges\n\nNews 7 hours, 6 minutes ago\n\n## AI joins the team at King: \"Our challenge is to create the right amount of\nchallenge\"\n\nNews 8 hours, 6 minutes ago\n\n## Discover essential UA and retention techniques plus key monetisation trends\nat the Dubai GameExpo Summit\n\nNews 8 hours, 23 minutes ago\n\n## Merge Mansion takes on environmental issues in time for Earth Day\n\nNews Apr 17th, 2024\n\n## Monopoly GO!
