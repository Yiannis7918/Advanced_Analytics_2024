They really thought\nthey could change the world! They absolutely couldn\u2019t! But all respect to them\nfor trying: someone got lucky with the wheel once, didn\u2019t they?\n\nBeing a transport visionary must have been more interesting back before\ntechnological progress and grotesque wealth allowed billionaires to \u201cdisrupt\u201d\nthe boring A-to-B-ness of conventional travel and blast a car into space, just\nbecause. Imagine conceiving of human flight back when your only model was\nbirds and some gossip about a guy called Icarus. Or looking at a horse and\nthinking: \u201cHmmm, that\u2019s fast, muscular and terrifying; I wonder if I could\ncompel it to take me somewhere, somehow?\u201d\n\nA quick timeline: the first transport other than walking was probably rafts,\naround 20,000BC. We don\u2019t know when and where exactly wheels appeared first \u2013\nprobably in several places simultaneously \u2013 but they were certainly around by\nthe copper age (3,500\u20132,300BC), when horses were also domesticated (respect to\nwhoever managed that). Most progress after that came in the shape of, erm,\nslightly better boats until someone invented the funicular railway, drawn by a\nhorse, in late-15th-century Austria. The 17th century brought the first\nsubmarine, and the 18th century brought the idea (if not the reality) of a\nhovercraft at the start, and by the end had given birth to the hot air balloon\nand steam engine. Things went even wilder in the 19th and 20th centuries, from\nblimps to hydrofoils, though we still don\u2019t have the jetpacks of our dreams.\n\nWhich, I suppose, is why we (well, they) keep trying. Maybe one day someone\nwill hit on a safe, swift system that isn\u2019t deadly, or dependent on fossil\nfuel or worse, Elon Musk, or requires you to sell your kidneys for a season\nticket. With that cheery thought in mind, time to board your \u201celectrophant\u201d (a\nmotorised elephant, invented in the 1940s, somewhat hampered by \u201ca slight\ndesign fault ... the exhaust fumes emitted from the elephant\u2019s trunk caused\nthe children riding on the back to choke\u201d) for a trundle around history\u2019s\nscattiest transport concepts.\n\n## Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s flying boat, c1490\n\nTo the Batmobile! ... one of Leonardo\u2019s designs. Photograph: Universal History\nArchive/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nDisappointingly few contemporary modes of transport \u2013 I think none, though I\nwould be thrilled to be corrected \u2013 look like vast nightmarish bats, and\nthat\u2019s why Leonardo da Vinci was a genius. His sketchbooks of the late 1480s\nand 90s are full of bat- and bird-winged flying-machine doodles that look like\nthe product of someone dismembering many bats (he was indeed \u201can extremely\nskilled dissector\u201d). None of these machines would have actually flown, because\nof \u201cphysics\u201d and \u201chuman physiognomy\u201d and so on, but who cares when they were\nthis cool?\n\n## The Man in the Moone, 1638\n\nSwanning off ... an early attempt at a paraglider. Photograph: Interfoto/Alamy\n\nOK, bishop Francis Godwin\u2019s splendidly strange creation was fictional, but\nwouldn\u2019t it be amazing if we could travel around pulled by a flock of wild\nswans (\u201cgansas\u201d, Godwin called them), which turn out to be strong enough to\nevade the gravitational pull of the Earth and take us to the moon? You know it\nwould. Dream bigger, future visionaries!\n\n## Mongolfi\u00e8re, 1783\n\nA lot of hot air ... ballooning at Versailles, France. Photograph: Science &\nSociety Picture Library/Getty Images\n\nSince a balloon trip is now something you give your parents for their golden\nwedding anniversary, it lacks the quixotic, ultimately doomed quality of other\nout-there transport. Still, imagine the outlandish scene when the Mongolfier\nbrothers put a duck, a cock and a sheep in a basket under a balloon and sent\nit skywards, observed by Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. No wonder their rival\nJacques Charles\u2019s version \u201cwas attacked by frightened peasants on landing\u201d.\nDespite that, balloonomania rapidly took hold: huge crowds gathered to view\ntake-offs, sometimes rioting when they didn\u2019t happen. Fun fact: competitive\nballooning was an Olympic event at Paris in 1900; one competitor reached\nRussia, where he was promptly arrested, later claiming: \u201cThe Russian officers\npersecuted me by the opening of so many bottles of French champagne that I was\nin great distress.\u201d Bring it back for this year!\n\n## \u2018Locomotion\u2019, 1820\n\n\u2018A few small inconveniences\u2019 ... Cruikshank\u2019s steam-powered boots. Photograph:\nHeritage Images/Getty Images\n\nIllustrator and satirist George Cruikshank claimed Oliver Twist was his idea,\nbecame a later-life fanatical teetotaller and was discovered on his deathbed\nto have 11 children, not with his wife. None of this is relevant to this\nexcellent caricature of a man in steam-powered boots, and other transport\nfantasies. The dawn of the steam age was causing as much terror as delight;\nlater, people believed train travel might make your uterus fall out.\n\n## Otto Lilienthal and his glider, 1896\n\nPoignant ... one of the last flights of Otto Lilienthal. Photograph: Keystone-\nFrance/Gamma-Keystone/Getty Images\n\nPrussian engineer Otto Lilienthal was inspired by birds in creating his\nterrifying flying machines (his research was published as Bird Flight as a\nBasis for Aviation) and it shows: some of his designs even incorporated\nflapping motion. Lilienthal managed a controlled flight of 24 metres (80ft) in\nhis Derwitzer glider before designing this, the anything-but-normal-looking\n\u201cNormalapparate\u201d. This picture commemorates one of his last flights before the\nNormalapparate crashed from a height of 15 metres, killing him. There\u2019s\nsomething awfully poignant about his dangling legs. Vale, Herr Lilienthal.\nLeonardo would have approved of you.\n\n## Moving pavement, 1900\n\nStand on the right ... a proto-travelator in Paris. Photograph: Universal\nHistory Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nThis breakout moment for moving pavements was \u201cthe Street of the Future\u201d\nshowcased at the Paris exhibition of 1900 (a smaller version appeared at the\nChicago World Fair in 1893). Its fastest platform went at 6mph (just under\n10kph) and on one of the fair\u2019s busiest days, it reportedly transported 70,000\npeople in an afternoon. I\u2019m not sure why they\u2019re now confined to short\ndistances through airports: I would absolutely venture out and keep the\neconomy going with frivolous purchases if I could be conveyed at 6mph with\nabsolutely no effort on my part.\n\n## Brennan\u2019s monorail c1910\n\nIt glides as softly as a cloud ... a monorail. Photograph: Alamy\n\nLike the jetpack, the monorail screams progress! Future! This, however, just\nseems to be some lads in a field going nowhere slowly. Perhaps it\u2019s not\nsurprising that the Irish-Australian engineer and torpedo inventor Louis\nBrennan\u2019s invention failed to attract sufficient investment to go anywhere,\ndespite being a viable, functioning mode of transport, tested and admired by\nWinston Churchill. \u201cOf the two vehicles built, one was sold as scrap, and the\nother was used as a park shelter.\u201d Oh dear. Bankrupt but undeterred, Brennan\ntried to make a helicopter, which he did get airborne, momentarily, but was\nagain abandoned by investors.\n\n## Gerder\u2019s Motorwheel, 1931\n\nBig wheel keep on turning ... M Gerder in his invention. Photograph: Fox\nPhotos/Getty Images\n\nIf exploring transport visionaries has taught me anything, it is that since\nthe dawn of wheels, men have wanted to sit inside them, hamster style. There\u2019s\na delightfully thorough survey of deranged monowheels here, dating right back\nto 1869. This \u201cmotorwheel\u201d is described in the picture caption as the creation\nof the driver, a Swiss engineer called Gerder, but he may in fact have been a\ncustomer of Davide Gislaghi (or Cislaghi), a Milanese policeman who invented\nthe motoruota. You can see it in action here. Regardless of whether or not he\ninvented it, Monsieur Gerder has the sparkling eye and beatific smile of a man\ntruly content with his absurd life choices, and I salute him for it.\n\n## JA Purves\u2019 Dynasphere, 1930\n\nGerbil alert ... JA Purves in his Dynasphere. Photograph: Fox Photos/Getty\nImages\n\nOne hamster wheel is simply not enough, so taking the rodent-propulsion\nimpulse to its logical conclusion/dead end, we have ... whatever the hell this\nis. I strongly recommend watching it roll at terrifying speed (30mph) in this\nshort film. Dr Purves, the inventor, also proposed a bus version, excitingly.\nHowever, there were \u201cdifficulties with steering and braking\u201d; there\u2019s a\nsuggestion the Dynasphere was prone to \u201cgerbiling\u201d, where passengers were spun\ninside the wheel when accelerating or braking.\n\n## MW Hulton\u2019s seashoes, 1962\n\nBest done in a suit ... Hulton walks on water. Photograph: Fox Photos/Getty\nImages\n\nA classic transport visionary here: impractical outfit; demonstrably daft\ninvention (\u201csea-shoes and duckfoot propellers\u201d); looks absolutely delighted\nwith himself. Walking on water is another idea that seems to obsess, well,\nmen: it was a Leonardo da Vinci thing \u2013 his involved cork skis and paddle\npoles \u2013 and has resurfaced occasionally ever since; the US has 100-plus\npatents for various versions, starting in 1858. A 2016 version, the FloatSki,\nwas hailed as the \u201cnext big fitness trend\u201d, but I haven\u2019t seen many people\nfloatskiing down my local waterways yet.\n\n## Bob Courter tests a jetpack, 1964\n\nAt last! ... the jetpack we were promised all those years ago. Photograph:\nFairfax Media Archives/Fairfax Media/Getty Images\n\nNow this is the future we were promised. Bell Aerosystems took the whole\njetpack thing (don\u2019t call it that, though \u2013 it\u2019s a \u201crocket belt\u201d) relatively\nfar in the 1950s, presenting one to the US army in 1960 and demo-ing it to the\npublic at various events after that, including the 1967 Super Bowl and the\n1984 LA Olympics. (A Bell pilot, William Suitor, doubled for Sean Connery when\nBond used one in Thunderball.) So why didn\u2019t it catch on? It \u201conly worked in\n20-second bursts\u201d, relatably.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Shock of the old\n  * Transport\n  * Aeronautics\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Fashion\n  * Food\n  * Recipes\n  * Love & sex\n  * Health & fitness\n  * Home & garden\n  * Women\n  * Men\n  * Family\n  * Travel\n  * Money\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
