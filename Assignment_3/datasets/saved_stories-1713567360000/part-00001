He had started back at Wrest Point in a time when people would\ndress up to go to the casino, and the penalty rates for dealers were so\noutrageous that some used to work casual for half the year, then take the\nother half off skiing around Europe. He would often greet me by saying,\n\u201cWelcome once again, young man to this international playground of the idle\nrich.\u201d It was a standard joke the two of us had as we then looked around and\nsaw no playground, and certainly no idle rich.\n\nThe line was a sort of gallows humour \u2013 an attempt to divert us from the grim\ntask we were there to do \u2013 namely, take money from people, and make them feel\ngood while doing it. One of the other jokes we had was to refer to the pokies\nin the casino as \u201cwages\u201d \u2013 they took people\u2019s to pay ours.\n\nThis joke was unfortunately much nearer the truth.\n\nWorking in a casino provides an interesting insight into people\u2019s psyche \u2013 on\nboth sides of the gaming tables. One of the first things a new dealer has to\nget used to quickly is to not give a damn about whether the punters won or\nlost \u2013 because they mostly lost. Often the reaction of the staff was then to\nbecome indifferent \u2013 all that mattered was that things were run well, that\neveryone was happy, that turnover was good, that no mistakes were made.\nPunters would often accuse us of wanting them to lose \u2013 mostly that was not\nthe case (unless they were particularly loathsome), we didn't need to want\nthem to lose, mathematics took care of that for us. On the games I dealt and\nsupervised the House advantages were as follows:\n\nBlackjack \u2013 0.80% Baccarat (banker) \u2013 1.17% Baccarat (player) \u2013 1.63% Roulette\n(single zero) \u2013 2.7% Caribbean Stud Poker \u2013 5.26% Big Wheel \u2013 11.1% to 24%\nSic-Bo \u2013 2.78-18.98%\n\nWe didn\u2019t need to wish or try and rig the game, the mathematics had rigged it\nfor us already. All we had to do was keep the turnover going and keep you\nhappy \u2013 happy enough so that if you did happen to win, you would come back.\nBecause the the golden rule of the casino world is that the house always wins\nin the end. Usually I worked nights, but for 6 months I worked on the day\nshift and it was without any doubt the most depressing time of my life (the\nonly time that came close was the period that I worked night shift). At night\nthere is always a chance you\u2019ll be dealing to tourists and people out for a\nnight; but during the day for the most part you are dealing to addicts.\n\nThe casino doors would open at 10am, and within a week I could predict 6-7 of\nthe first 10 through the door. Many were pensioners. Those I did know played\nroulette; the many more I didn\u2019t know played the pokies.\n\nIn life you often look around for someone or something to compare yourself\nfavourably with. For the games dealers and supervisors in a casino whose souls\nare troubled can look to the poker machines and say, well at least we provide\nentertainment (we\u2019re in the hospitality industry, don\u2019t you know!). But in\nreality, that was just bullshit we told ourselves. The machines blinked and\nmade music while they took the money; we smiled and chatted aimlessly while we\ntook it.\n\nWe liked to think that the pokies were the ones that did the damage but the\nfact is all casino games do damage, just more slowly, and with a smile. If you\nwere a regular we quickly signed you up to the Casino Club. This meant that\nwhen you bet you gave us the card and we recorded how much you bet, for how\nhow long and how much you won or lost. It was like a frequent flyer card \u2013 the\nmore you bet the more points you were awarded that got you free drinks, meals,\nrooms in the hotel etc.\n\nOf course that was all just a guise. It was there to ensure we knew where our\nmoney was (it is the casino\u2019s money \u2013 if you are a regular and you won, we\u2019d\nrefer to it a \u201cshort term loan\u201d \u2013 and we sure as hell knew it would come back\nwith interest).\n\nThe worst moment for me as a dealer was during that 6 month day-shift stint,\nwhen on a quiet day in came a couple on their honeymoon. They were full of joy\nand love and life was grand and beautiful. And then they came to my Blackjack\ntable. The husband, took out $50 from an envelope \u2013 it was obviously their\nholiday spending money \u2013 and the careful way they treated the envelope gave a\npretty good indication that it was all they had to spend.\n\nThey bet $10 a hand and I took it all off them in 5 hands. This was unlucky,\nbut not remarkable. It was a bugger because they were actually very nice and I\nwould have liked to be able to chat to them on this very boring shift; and\ngiven it was their honeymoon it would have been nice to see them win.\n\nThey moved to leave, but then they looked at each other with a \u201cwell we\u2019re\nonly here once\u201d and put down another $50. This time it took me a bit longer to\nwin it, but win it I did.\n\nNow the faces were losing that flush of joy and happiness and life and\ngrandness and beauty. For the first time in ages I was truly sad and wished I\ncould somehow help them to win (but alas, mathematics had them beat). I\napologised and wished them well \u2013 almost telling them to leave \u2013 but instead\nof going the husband said let\u2019s try it one more time and pulled out not $50\nbut $100, which I then took in less than 20 hands. Blackjack can be fast, but\nwhen you are the only player on the table, it is lightning.\n\nAnd so they put the envelope back in her bag, and it dawned on them that the\n$200 which could have been spent on a trip out to the reef, or on a couple\ndinners, or presents to each other, or perhaps just a crap load of souvenirs\nwas now in the money box on my blackjack table, and it wasn\u2019t coming back. No\nbeauty, grandness, life, love, joy or happiness went with them.\n\nSuch examples caused me to go very close to the edge after two years of full\ntime work, and so I went back to university, worked casual at the casino for\nanother four years until the bile inside me from working there reached a point\nthat I walked out after one shift and never rang up to ask for another shift.\n\nThis of course \u2013 in a very long and windy way \u2013 brings me to the Wilkie-\nXenophon anti-pokies proposal. One of the other jokes we had was about the\npoker machines in the casino was that no casino ever took out poker machines\nto put in more blackjack tables. It was another gallows humour joke, because\nwe always knew our job could be replaced by a machine. The reason of course is\nbecause each poker machine doesn\u2019t need a dealer, they have a lot higher\nturnover and better winning percentage.\n\nThe truth of this can be seen in the Productivity Commission\u2019s 2010 Report\ninto gambling. Pokies are to gambling like Crack Cocaine is to drugs. We on\nthe gaming tables were dealing out the gambling equivalent of marijuana and\nEcstasy (not good, but good enough that in a moral free zone you could\nconvince yourself you weren\u2019t too bad), but the pokies? Wow.\n\nIt\u2019s all about speed. The best thing about my abilities as a dealer was that I\nwas fast; I may have been the least hospitable dealers in the history of the\nindustry, but management loved that I churned out the cards and kept the ball\nspinning. Turnover is the key. I was fast, but unless you were the lone player\non the table, there was no way I could match the pokies.\n\nAnd the horses? There may be race meetings all over the country and throughout\nAsia, but you\u2019re still going to have to wait to bet \u2013 and geez they take ages\nto run around the track and then there\u2019s the whole correct weight thing.\n\nYou want to spend money, and you want to spend it quick (and let me tell you\nthat is what the owners of casinos and clubs want you to do)? Then sit\nyourself down and start feeding in the notes \u2013 no need to worry about some\nhuman changing the money for casino chips and then dealing out cards \u2013 just\npress that button as fast as you can.\n\nAnd how fast is that? The Productivity Commission tells us that as well:\n\nIn NSW there are no regulated spin rates \u2013 so you can be sure it\u2019s short \u2013 all\nthe quicker to allow you to press the button again, and given Victoria can\nallow 28 spins a minute (up to $10 a pop) that is zipping by too fast to even\nregister the losses. But losses there can be \u2013 $1,200 an hour.\n\nNow I certainly saw people lose $1,200 in an hour \u2013 but not at the seemingly\nlow value $10 a hand. In fact $10 black jack tables are about the cheapest you\ncan get nowadays \u2013 the casino makes up for the lack of speed by increasing the\nminimum bet. To lose $1,200 in an hour on blackjack would have meant you doing\nsome serious punting \u2013 probably $25 a hand at minimum.\n\nThe Productivity Commission also nicely shows the adage that the House always\ngets you in the end is true. As you can see in the upper left graph below, 30\nper cent of players can win if they just play the pokies one session of one\nhour. That sounds about right \u2013 a group of 10 friends playing the pokies \u2013\nthree winning, the rest losing seems about right. Come back four times though\nand that winning percentage is down to 21 per cent. Sixteen times \u2013 and only 7\nper cent. Sixty four times \u2013 and yes, we may well be talking problem gamblers\nhere \u2013 and the winning percentage is 1 per cent.\n\nThe problem is that people addicted to gambling focus on the 30 per cent and\nignore the 1 per cent. How many people do you know who gamble who tell you\nabout the wins, but from whom you never hear the losses? It\u2019s not just because\nthey don\u2019t talk of losses, it often is because they have forgotten them \u2013\nuntil the time comes that they are so big that they can\u2019t be ignored, and so\nthey keep playing thinking this session they\u2019ll be one of the 30 per cent, not\nrealising they\u2019re already in the 99 per cent losers category. (And remember\nwe;re not talking the horses where you can study the form guide and make an\neducated bet \u2013 this is you against mathematics \u2013 the machines are programmed\nto win)\n\nReading the submissions from clubs into the Parliamentary Inquiry into pre-\ncommitments scheme is like going back in time and hearing the protestations\nfrom tobacco companies when they were being banned from sponsoring sports. All\nthe talk is of the valuable input into the community and into sport that the\nrevenue from the clubs provides. For example the submission from Clubs WA\nwhich is the only state not to have poker machines in clubs complains about\nthat fact:\n\n\"Western Australian clubs are smaller and have much lower revenue and smaller\ncapital expenditure, employ fewer people, are able to donate less to charity\nand sport groups, provide more limited services, and have a smaller economic\npresence and contribution. A stronger club industry in Western Australia would\nbring benefits to all. It would increase club viability and expand the\nbenefits they could provide to their communities.\"\n\nI love how there is all this talk of more revenue but with bugger all\nacknowledgement of what that means \u2013 it means people are losing money. The\nCommission also found that the people contributing to this lovely revenue are\nnot all just having a \u201cflutter\u201d:\n\n> About 4 per cent of adults play gaming machines weekly or more often. Around\n> 15 per cent of this group would be classified as problem gamblers, with\n> around an additional 15 per cent experiencing moderate risks. And their\n> share of total spending on machines is estimated to range around 40 per\n> cent.\n\nSo how good is it to know that 40 per cent of any so called \u201cbenefits\u201d of\nsporting equipment etc comes from people addicted to gambling?\n\nThe Productivity Commission also looked at these societal benefit claims as\nwell, and found they were all a bit rubbery. Take sport. The PC found there\nwas no correlation between number of poker machines and kids playing sport:\n\nWA had more kids as a percentage playing sport than either NSW or QLD \u2013 the\ntwo states with the longest and deepest pokies and clubs cultures. The\ncommission also found that the bigger the club was in terms of poker machines,\nthe less money as a share of revenue was spent on sporting facilities \u2013 ie\nmore pokies did not lead to better facilities:\n\nThe Productivity Commission also found that the talk of employment was pretty\niffy as well \u2013 because the assertion by the clubs implied that the people\nemployed there would not be able to find other work. It found\n\n> Many people are employed in the gambling industry. However, most are highly\n> employable and would be in demand in other parts of the service sector were\n> the gambling industry to contract. In that sense, the gambling industries do\n> not create net employment benefits, because they divert employment from one\n> part of the economy to another.\n\nBut the Productivity Commission then did the figures and found this surprising\nstatistic:\n\n> While it is not possible to be definitive about the costs and benefits of\n> gambling, the Commission estimates that in 2008-09:\n>\n>   * the benefits from tax revenue and enjoyment of gambling for recreational\n> gamblers ranged between $12.1 and $15.8 billion\n>   * the costs to problem gamblers ranged between $4.7 and $8.4 billion\n>   * the overall net benefits ranged between $3.7 and $11.1 billion.\n>\n\nSo it seems all is good then \u2013 there are costs to gambling, but the benefits\noutweigh it? No need to do anything? Well yes, except straight afterward the\nCommission includes this very telling point:\n\n> The net benefits could be much larger if governments reduced the costs\n> through effective prevention and harm minimisation policies.\n\nAnd what do they consider to be the best harm minimisation policy? Well there\nare many \u2013 but the key one for poker machines was this:\n\n> Each state and territory government should implement a jurisdictionally-\n> based full pre-commitment system for gaming machines by 2016, subject to\n> initial development (recommendation 19.1), trialling (recommendation 19.2)\n> and compatible monitoring systems (recommendation 10.6). This system should:\n>\n>   * provide a means by which players could voluntarily set personally-\n> defined precommitments and, at a minimum, a spending limit, without\n> subsequently being able to revoke these in the set period\n>   * allow players to see their transaction history\n>   * encourage gamblers to play within safe spending and time limits, by\n> specifying default limits\n>   * include the option for gamblers to set no limit on their spending as one\n> of the system options, but with periodic checking that this remains their\n> preference\n>   * allow occasional gamblers to stake small amounts outside the system\n>   * include measures to avoid identity fraud\n>   * ensure players\u2019 privacy\n>   * be simple for gamblers to understand and use\n>   * present few obstacles to future innovation in the presentation and\n> design of the system\n>   * apply to all gaming machines in all venues in a jurisdiction, with an\n> exemption until 2018 for venues with less than ten machines that also face\n> significant implementation costs relative to revenue.\n>\n\nThis is what Wilkie wants \u2013 note a few key things \u2013 \u201callow occasional gamblers\nto stake small amounts outside the system\u201d. So no, it is not a licence to\ngamble. Is this an infringement on liberty? Pfft. No more than my having to\nshow ID when I buy the pseudoephedrine cold and flu tablets at the chemist.\nDoes it stop me buying them? Nope.\n\nLet\u2019s cut the crap about \u201cnanny state\u201d. You like betting on the horses?\nNothing will change. You like playing blackjack? Nothing will change. You like\nbetting on the AFL? Nothing will change. You like playing the pokies. Well you\nwould need to get a card and set a limit on how much you will lose. The big\nthing \u2013 you choose. Here\u2019s what Xenophon says:\n\n> Mandatory pre-commitment allows gamblers playing these high intensity\n> machines to choose what they are willing to lose before they start using the\n> machines. It will be a national system to protect all Australians who may\n> become addicted to poker machines.\n\nSo people choosing for themselves how much they are prepared to lose is a\nrestriction on people's rights? Please. Imagine if say you had a credit card\nwhere you were able to set how much you could borrow against it, would you\nconsider that an infringement on your rights? Of course not, because we all\nhave that right now. My wife and I constantly get letters from our bank\ntelling us we can increase our limit, but we don\u2019t because we are happy with\nwhat we have \u2013 it protects us \u2013 it forces us if we want to use more credit to\ntransfer real money into our credit card account.\n\nThe Clubs Association in response to the Wilkie-Xenophon reforms have gone\nabsolutely ape-shit. And started an advert campaign including this absolutely\nstupid ad:\n\nFirst off, who the hell do the Clubs think are their members? If this advert\nis anything to go by they think they are all Neanderthal dopes whose parents\nare supremely glad they learned to walk upright.\n\nNeed a licence to bet $10? Nope. Government tracking you? Nope. (But don\u2019t\nworry, the clubs will but think of it a frequent flyer points, remember). And\nas for the Government telling you how many beers you can have? Well they do\nalready \u2013 unless you haven\u2019t noticed all the signs in pubs saying they can\u2019t\nserve people who are intoxicated. In SA for eg:\n\n> It is an offence to serve liquor to a person whose speech, balance,\n> coordination or behaviour is noticeably impaired and it is reasonable to\n> believe that the impairment is the result of the consumption of liquor.\n\nSo yep the law already says how many beers you can be served. And then there\u2019s\nthe sporting grounds who don\u2019t allow you to bring beers into the ground etc\netc, so let\u2019s not carry on like the world is a total beer free-for-all.\n\nSure my views on gambling are biased from my time being part of the problem,\nbut the Productivity Commission is not generally known as a cuddly, basket\nweaving won\u2019t somebody think of the children type organisation. I would be\nagainst the Government setting limits on losses \u2013 but we\u2019re not there \u2013 as\nXenophon above points out.\n\nGambling is already restricted to those over 18 \u2013 you think that might give\naway the fact it has some negative impacts \u2013 so let\u2019s not pretend that we can\ncome out of the womb and start playing the pokies.\n\nThese new laws aren\u2019t about stopping your fun, they\u2019re about helping those for\nwhom it is no longer fun, and they no longer can stop. And what the clubs want\nyou to forget is that 40 per cent of their revenue is from these people. I\ndon\u2019t think Governments need to always tell us what to do (but I have no\nproblems with say seat belt laws or road speeds) but Governments should help\nthe helpless.\n\nProblem gamblers need help, if that means you have to get a card before you go\nblow $200 on the pokies? Big deal.\n\nPosted by\n\nGreg Jericho at\n\n10:48 PM\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\nLabels: Australian politics, Culture, Economy\n\n#### 75 comments:\n\nthirdborn said...\n\n    \n\nWell done Grog, you're the first person to explain this properly such that I\nnow understand it.

Because if Bob Jones from out of town can stick\n$5 on the pokies without a card, then Dan Smith the problem gambler can do the\nsame thing.\n\nUnless we're saying that Bob Jones has to play the Tab or the Keno and not the\npokies, in which case fine, and I agree with the policy, but it does still\nmean that a \"licence\" is required for pokies players...\n\n    April 13, 2011 at 12:02 AM\n\nMeg Thornton said...\n\n    \n\nA small side note regarding the whole \"pokies in clubs in WA\" thing.\n\nThere are a few key factors here. Firstly, most of WA's population (and thus\nthe majority of Western Australian gamblers) lives in the Perth metro area.\nPerth, coincidentally, just happens to be the home of the only casino in the\nstate (at Burswood, easily reachable via train, bus and private transport).\nThe Burswood casino has pokies, as well as all the other standard casino\ngames.\n\nHaving lived over east (in Canbrrra) for a while, I can say there is a WA\nalternative to the bustling club culture of NSW and the ACT - over here, it's\nthe pubs. Hotels here sell food and drink, as well as alcohol, and there's\noften live music as well. Quite often, there's a TAB agency in the bar as well\n(so you can get your bets in on the gee-gees and the footy while you wait for\nyour beer).\n\n    April 13, 2011 at 12:11 AM\n\nChase Stevens said...\n\n    \n\nOnce problem Gamblers reach their pre-commitment limit aren't they just going\nto substitute the pokies for another form of gambling?\n\nI hope they don't because I would really like a pre-commitment to work. It\nsounds like an excellent idea, but that substitution is what worries me.\n\n    April 13, 2011 at 12:42 AM\n\nCasablanca said...\n\n    \n\nA timely and informative piece Grog. A comment following an SMH article by\nPhillip Coorey is also of interest and worth repeating here. The commenter\nstated that s/he used to work in Engineering Research and Development in\nAustralia\u2019s biggest poker machine manufacturer.\n\n\u201cAll poker machines built in Australia in the past 10 years have a player\ntracking facility already built in to allow for bonus points, house prizes,\nlinked super jackpots etc. all the punter has to do is swipe their club\nmembership draw in the machine to go into the entry to win the major draw. It\nis also in the machines in the pubs as well. A minor tweak of the software\nwould allow the cards to be issued free of charge at every venue so as to\nactivate the machine to play it.\n\nPeople accept that when they get a credit card, it comes with a predetermined\nlimit on it. When a patron of the club or pub goes into play the pokies, their\ncard will have a designated limit on it, once used, it can't be recharged for\n24 hours. Make the maximum limit $100.00 in a 24 hour period.\n\nThe most a person could lose in a week would be $700. The problem is that the\nClubs, pubs and state governments are addicted to the revenue of the income of\nthe pokies as much as the people who are addicted to playing every dollar they\ncan beg borrow or steal to put into them.\n\nThe other thing that needs to change is to start removing the complexity of\nthe multi-line, multi-mode machines as not even those that created them can\nexplain the winning combinations properly...\u201d.\n\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/labor-needs-another-messy-battle-like-\na-hole-in-the-head-20110411-1db5h.html\n\n    April 13, 2011 at 1:34 AM\n\nLloyd said...\n\n    \n\nHave a feeling this one will come back to bite O'Farrell and Clubs Australia.\nCommunity sentiment might not be as easily manipulated as they think. The\ncampaign is SUCH an obvious lie I think public opinion for once will come down\nfirmly onside with Wilkie and the Government.\n\n    April 13, 2011 at 8:23 AM\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n    \n\nWas married to a person who was addicted to the pokies, and I had no idea just\nhow much money he was 'donating' to the local clubs as he looked after the\nfinances. It wasn't until we split up and I, as a single Mum on single parent\nbenefits, suddenly had more money than I ever had before. I think of all the\nwasted opportunity, the 12 years where not a cent was saved, where we lived in\na stinking little flat, lived on two minute noodles and weetbix and often had\nthe phone and electricity cut off for lack of payment, when in reality we had\nperfectly adequate income for a modest lifestyle *had it not been for the\npokies*.\n\nHe excelled at hiding his addiction, and had any number of excuses as to why\nwe had no money (and I believed him for 11 of our 12 years). Would these\nproposed new restrictions have stopped him gambling. No, not at all, he was\n(and still is) an addict. But is there a possibility that his addiction would\nnot have had such an impact on our lives? Yes. and as such, I support them\nfully.\n\nIf it saves one other family from going what I went through, then please,\nbring them in.\n\n    April 13, 2011 at 8:44 AM\n\nRachel said...\n\n    \n\nI can tell you from personal experience, no I wouldn't replace pokies with an\nalternative form of betting. This is needed, and it's needed now.\n\n    April 13, 2011 at 9:05 AM\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n    \n\nMusician mate has made a comment that it'll be interesting to see if\nrestrictions on pokie 'entertainment' in pubs will mean a return of the pub\nlive music scene us older people recall. We then got into a discussion about\nwhether the pubs could afford to employ the bands after losing the income.\nThis got me thinking about a secondary 'benefit' from this legislation. It's\nlargely acknowledged that there's a drinking culture problem in some areas of\nthe country, not least exacerbated by an oversupply of venue licenses. Maybe,\njust maybe, there'll be a side effect of reducing the number of licensed\nvenues - something the Federal Health department probably wouldn't argue\nagainst, whilst never ever really having the constitutional power to be able\nto do so.

I was thinking about licences. We need\none for a car becuse it is dangerous to ourselves and others to drive without\nprior instruction. We need one for a gun similarly, and we need one to work in\ncertain trades because of harm we can do to others. Gambling can let off\nsteam, entertain or fill in time but the danger of doing harm to others is\nincredibly high. And it is not just those who know the gambler who suffer.\nSociety as a whole has to pick up the tab. Society has to care for those\nfamilies devastated, those businesses that fail and those people whose health\nfails because of the gambling. Society has to set limits on things that will\ndamage the society, we do it all the time.\n\n    April 13, 2011 at 9:57 AM\n\nFQ said...\n\n    \n\nI agree with Rachel.

(Negative\nreinforcement, or punishment.)\n\nWinning is pleasure. Losing brings on unpleasant feelings, and even mental and\nphysical distress. Addicts (and potential addicts) do not go from 'being a\nwinner' to neutral, they become 'losers', a very emotionally negative and\ndistressing state. They can even have physical reactions, like the lowering\nthe pleasure-inducing chemicals in the brain. They can end up feeling stress-\ninduced physical pain.\n\nIf pulling a lever gives you a chocolate and stopping pulling that lever\nshowers yor groin with ice-water, you have an extra incentive to pull the\nlever.\n\nOf course using negative reinforcement like that to train animals s not only\ncruel and illegal but can cause them to go insane.

An hour\nand a bit later she left and when she checked her bank balance discovered she\nhad spent closer to $300. Her husband is a well known tight wad and she was in\na frantic state as this wasn't the first wad of cash she had blow since he had\ngone. We talked about her families love affair with poker machines and I\nsuggested that maybe it was time to seek some help. She did and hasn't gone\nnear a poker machine since. It took her about five years just to enter a club\nor pub again, such was her fear of relapse. Her family thinks there was\nnothing wrong with her little flutter and somehow hold her husband responsible\nfor her, they perceive, over reaction to gambing away her money. Such is the\ndepth of their denial. They used to tell me how much they had won but got sick\nof me asking how much they had lost between this win and the last. This\nproblem, like alcohol, seems to run in families. I grew up watching my\nrelatives drink and gamble their money away always seeking help to pay their\nbills from my non gambling father.

It will be of great\nbenefit. I became hooked on the pokies not long after turning 18. At first it\nwasn't so bad; I got some high destinctions at uni, performed to high acclaim\nin amateur theatre groups, had a job and plenty of friends. There were no\nobvious traumas in my life. But it steadily took over my life and all those\nthings fell by the wayside. I dropped out of uni, became isolated and\nunemployed. No money saved and nothing achieved in all these years. still\nliving at home at 23.\n\nI'd like to correct some mis-conceptions/ challenge some stereotypes: * Most\naddicts understand we can't win. We know the statistics and I for one\nunderstand the gamblers fallacy. * I have never stolen anything to feed this\nhabit. I ransacked my mum's room looking for my money she was keeping safe\nfrom me and obligations such as birthday presents have not been met, but never\nany theft. * At GA there are a few exceptions but from my experience and what\nI've seen of others GAMBLERS KNOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM AND WANT TO QUIT. I knew\nvery early on that there was a problem and I've been trying to quit ever\nsince, never any denial. If this technology can get me off the machines then\nill set the limit at zero. I've been banned from fourty pubs (the maximum\naloud) but I currently just go further afield to get to a pub. *The crack-\ncocaine versus marijuana analogy is an apt one. I have never had a problem\nwith any other form of gambling. According to my councillor only one of the\ncountless gamblers she had treated over the years had a problem with another\nformat and even he/she primarily used the pokies.\n\nGovernment/Business I say to you: Please don't blame the victim. Don't use\n\"personal responsibility\" (sic) to wash your hands of responsibility. This\nepidemic is the result of the system.\n\nWilkie, you are a champ!

One of the key differences is that the PC recommended\na jurisdictionally-based full pre-commitment system NOT a national system. A\nbig difference. Each state/territory operates and monitors machines\ndifferently and this is one of the reasons for disagreement. It\u2019s not as\nsimple as you say, big deal get a card.\n\nIn NSW it's a significant technological change and to retrofit an existing\nmachine ($3K +) or an older machine would need replacing ($20-25K).\n\nAnother key difference is that clubs support a voluntary, affordable venue\nbased pre commitment scheme and argue why you need a mandatory program for\n100% of players when problem gamblers represent less than 1% generally &\nproblem gambling prevalence rates are already falling.\n\nWe\u2019ve had responsible gaming legislation since 2001. Personally I've spoken\ndirectly to problem gamblers alone, with their partners and with families of\nproblem gamblers. We direct people to counsellors, execute self exclusion\ndeeds and genuinely seek to help. No system is perfect and self exclusion\nalone won\u2019t solve problem gambling. Education and professional assistance are\nthe drivers for long term solutions.\n\nIn NSW, problem gambling rates halved from 0.8% 2006 to 0.4% 2008 (NSW\nPopulation Health Survey). Calls to G-line, the Govt help line for gambling,\nfell from 12,300 in 2002, to 6,100 in 2009, despite substantial marketing of\nthe service, including in venues.\n\nThe Qld Govt conducted four surveys over seven years from 2001, and found a\nsystematic decline in adult prevalence rates, from 0.83% to 0.37%.\n\nIn Norway, they removed all poker machines in 2008. In Nov 2008, SINTEF\n(Scandinavia\u2019s largest independent research org0 found no change in the\nproportion of problem gamblers in 2008 compared to 2007, despite all poker\nmachines being removed. It found problem gamblers switched from poker machines\nto internet gambling when the machines were removed.\n\nA leading academic on problem gambling, Professor Alex Blaszczynski, advised\nthe Parliamentary Committee (chaired by Mr Wilkie) \"that pre-commitment is\nunlikely to have a significant impact on the majority of problem gamblers, and\nmay even exacerbate problem gambling.\u201d\n\nSo despite evidence of problem gambling rates falling, examples where problem\ngamblers 'move' to alternatives and independent academics querying the\nprogram, Wilkie will not budge & consider that he may destroy an industry &\nNOT get the most important outcome, helping problem gamblers.\n\nMy club will barely afford the implementation costs and if we did we\u2019d last\nperhaps 2 years at the estimated revenue drop. No doubt many would say \u2018who\ncares\u2019 but let me give some final comments about my regional club.\n\nGaming is 64% of our income, food 18%, beverage 11%, 7% other. Aside from\ngaming, we have members/visitors who rarely or never play pokies attending our\nclub for 1 of 12 intra club sports/activities, dining, entertainment or\nfunctions. Weekly, 750 people attend meetings of a non profit/charity (Rotary,\nLions, Probus etc) who enjoy either free or heavily subsidised room hire. The\ncomputer club, run by volunteers has trained 1,000 people (mostly seniors) in\n3yrs at less than $4 per lesson.\n\nWhen our local Vietnam Veterans club lost the venue that hosted their annual\nLong Tan Day service we built a garden and memorial and every year host the\nservice and provide a luncheon afterward (we are not an RSL club). My staff\ncreated a benevolent fund where weekly payroll donations are used to help\nother staff in need or community groups.\n\nYes we have pokies and yes we\u2019re not perfect. But we are not industry scum, I\nam not a fat cat manager and my staff are decent people. We are a community\nclub.\n\nMany people would be sad to see us disappear. If Andrew Wilkie thinks\nmandatory pre commitment is the silver bullet and is prepared to see an\nindustry decimated I guess he and I will be looking for a new job in years to\ncome.\n\n    April 13, 2011 at 4:55 PM\n\nSteve Pratt said...\n\n    \n\nNothing to add to this excellent piece, except...I am glad I live in Western\nAustralia.\n\n    April 13, 2011 at 5:00 PM\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n    \n\nGrog, I'm delighted to see your piece appear on the Drum.

The old saying is there is no such\nthing as a bad Craps dealer, because bad dealers don't get to deal Craps.\n\nI would have loved to deal Craps - it is a game where the dealers actually\nhave to think - most of the Casino games are constructed so dealer have to do\nas little thinking as possible!\n\n***\n\nAnon - yep pension day was always busy.

A trial of a full pre-commitment\nsystem with the design features should be conducted\u2019.\n\nUnder Wilkie\u2019s Law there are no trials to test the design features for\nmodifications nor as the PC suggests, \u2018substantiation that full pre-commitment\nhas sufficient advantages over partial pre-commitment to justify proceeding\nwith its implementation in all jurisdictions\u2019.\n\nIf it\u2019s as easy as getting a card to gamble as suggested, anyone remember\nVictoria\u2019s myki ticket system? In 2005, then Victorian premier Steve Bracks\nannounced that the myki ticketing system for all Victorian public transport\nwould be fully operational by 2007. The myki ticketing system was to replace\nMetcards & paper tickets for 1,700 metropolitan buses, 350 trains, 500 trams,\nregulated in one jurisdiction and to cover the approximate 1 million trips\nmade on Melbourne\u2019s public transport system daily.\n\nBy comparison, it is estimated there are at least 650 million transactions\neach day on poker machines nationwide. There are 197,000 machines in 5,700\nvenues, with at least 15 existing systems operators, with 9 operating\nprotocols, in 8 jurisdictions. In one year, around 5 million Australians will\nplay a poker machine at least once, each requiring a smart card or similar\ndevice. Who pays for the software/hardware changes? And of course, a myki card\nthat has reached its limit does not have to cause a bus to shut down.\n\nFor myki, more than five years and $700 million later: \u2018Obviously it's been a\ndisaster in the terms of the cost to taxpayers and its failure to roll out\nsuccessfully... The bottom line is myki's been a financial disaster, it's been\na functional disaster, there are serious questions about the Farebox, about\nthe hand-held devices, about the functions available and indeed about its\ndistribution and the take-up from commuters.\u2019 Victorian Premier Ted Baillieu,\nHerald Sun, 28 December 2010\n\nClubs & Pubs SUPPORT partial pre commitment on a venue by venue,\njurisdictional basis.\n\n    April 13, 2011 at 10:33 PM\n\nUnknown said...\n\n    \n\nIn Syndey there is a club the Rooty Hill RSL, spending millions of dollars for\nit's own postcode.

It'salways\nthe kids and innocent spouse that bears the real brunt of poker machine\naddiction.\n\n    April 13, 2011 at 11:12 PM\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n    \n\nI read this piece at The Drum Greg and commented there. Impressive. For the\nnay sayers @Shockadelic I have personally known someone whose addiction has\nshattered his life. He, in the end, had to leave the country to conquer it. If\nthe limits work many people will be better off.\n\nShockadelic whilst I understand that you are 'concerned' about liberties being\neroded I also think your response to be ill informed and niave. Limits are not\na bad thing for anyone for any leisure pastime because for many, and this is\nthe intended goal for clubs and the poker machine producers, it ceases to\nbecome a pastime it invades their lives totally. Knowing what I know about\npoker machines and their users over many years I laugh about the statistics\nbeing used to define how many addicts there are. It's totally one of the\nbiggest under estimates I have ever read.\n\nThe bastard clubs have literally been laughing all the way to the bank. I\ndespise how they trot out that they do so much for the community. Football\nclubs in particular are pariahs on society. They pay outrageous salaries to\nadministrators and obscene pay cheques to players. Where do they get the money\n- I wonder!\n\n    April 13, 2011 at 11:16 PM\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n    \n\nPacker sends buses to pick up people out west of Sydney to come to his casino.\nMainly pensioners.

I live in an area where\n$17,000,000 was put through the pokies a couple of years ago and no doubt that\n$ value has kept rising. No one in the community was really aware of this\nfigure and those who did know didn't seem to think it was an issue. At the\nsame time a non government welfare agency in the area was being \"funded\" a\npittance of that amount to offer welfare support and counselling to addicts\nand their families.Not much reflection is given to where the profit from\ngambling on the pokies comes from(mostly from the addicted who by the very\nnature of that addiction are amongst our most disadvantaged).Once again the\nnon governments who operate on the smell of an oily rag are left to pick up\nthe pieces.I think that one of the issues about any addiction is that most of\nthe community don't really understand the nature of what and how this works\nfor the addict. It's not just a question of will and self control. Addicts\ndon't wake up one morning and say \"Guess what??I'm going to become a gambler\ntoday-it's going to be so fun!!\" This is an issue of social justice-not social\nliberty.We need to be thinking about the victims of this community sanctioned\n\"game\"-the addicts and also ther families.\n\n    April 14, 2011 at 10:29 AM\n\ntortfeaser said...\n\n    \n\nGreat work Greg.

So why are we so sure that further voluntary systems\nwill? Your credit card analogy is all well and good for people who have some\nself-control, but by definition, compulsive gamblers don't.\n\nIf the government imposes limits, it might get the job done. But if it's left\nup to gamblers, I don't see how this voluntary system will be much more\neffective than the current one.\n\n    April 14, 2011 at 3:40 PM\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n    \n\nhttp://www.nickxenophon.com.au/itsabigfatlie/\n\n    April 14, 2011 at 4:49 PM\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n    \n\nProfessor Alex Blaszczynski (University of Sydney), a member of the\nMinisterial Expert Advisory Council, co-authored a recent article \u201cGambling\nMotivations, Money-Limiting Strategies, and Pre-Commitment Preferences of\nProblem Gamblers Versus Non-Problem Gamblers.\u201d 20 The article concludes:\n\n[The] study is the first to explore gambling motivations in the context of\npre-session monetary limit-setting strategies and attitudes toward pre-\ncommitment as a means of limiting gambling expenditures.\n\nAn increasing number of manufacturers are marketing proprietary software and\ncomputer devices for pre-commitment without scientific evidence that such\ninnovations will, in fact, decrease gambling expenditures among problem\ngamblers or arrest the progression toward problem gambling from those who are\nat low- to moderate-risk.\n\nResults of the current study suggest that those most in need of limitsetting,\nproblem gamblers, are the least likely to adopt the use of smart cards and\nother pre-commitment technologies and the most likely to find ways around\nlimitations.\n\n    April 14, 2011 at 6:21 PM\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n    \n\nWilkie\u2019s agreement to implement mandatory pre-commitment uniform across all\nstates and territories by 2014 is not what the Productivity Commission\nrecommended.\n\nThe PC stated \u2018in the next three years, partial pre-commitment should be\nintroduced in jurisdictions with compatible monitoring systems, while ensuring\nthat the systems underlying this are compatible with the later adoption of\nfull pre-commitment.\n\nSo why no initial partial pre commitment (jurisdictionally based)?\n\nFurther, the PC said trialling should test the design features of full pre-\ncommitment for possible modification and substantiate that full pre-commitment\nhas sufficient advantages over partial pre commitment to justify proceeding\nwith its implementation in all jurisdictions.\n\nSo why no testing and trialling?\n\nRemember the Tcard fiasco in NSW? The myki saga in Victoria? The scale of\nnational full pre commitment dwarfs both projects.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about new technology on an untested system for 197,000 machines\nin 5,700 venues, with at least 15 existing systems operators, with 9 operating\nprotocols, in 8 jurisdictions conducting an estimated 650 million transactions\ndaily.\n\nWhat chance of working first up?\n\nWhat help will a dysfunctional system be to problem gamblers?\n\n    April 14, 2011 at 6:38 PM\n\nShockadelic said...\n\n    \n\nAnonymous said \"For the nay sayers @Shockadelic I have personally known\nsomeone whose addiction has shattered his life.

I hope you have sent the URL to Wilkie and Xenophon.\n\nRe the comment \" The Burswood casino has pokies\". No. The pokies in the\nBurswood casino are not like the pokies in the other states. Government law\npermits only older models that require two presses of the button -- you may\nknow these as the gaming machines such as the draw poker or Keno variety where\nthe user has to make some automous decision during the course of the game\nwhereas the \"pokies\" in the other states are purely randomised games of chance\nwith the rotating wheels. The former variety of \"pokie\" or EGM (electronic\ngaming machine) has a far slower turnover which means, in turn, slower losses.\n\nThe gaming industry not only destroys families, it does not really create\nmeaningful employment, it actually cannibalises the workforce by creating\nMcJobs; low-skilled, low paid jobs where the employer demands disproportionate\nloyalty from employees. I should know; during my undergrad years I was a\ncasino dealer and a union delegate in a Brisbane casino.\n\nObserver.
