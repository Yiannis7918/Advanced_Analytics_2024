Oh,\nsweet relief. Your eyeballs are bathed in fluid as your lids momentarily\nclose.\n\nBut blinking does more than wet the eye. Strangely, it also helps with vision,\na new study shows. It's the latest effort in a string of research studies\nattempting to pinpoint what blinking is useful for, as we do it more often\nthan necessary to lubricate the eye.\n\n\"We show that blinking increases the power of retinal stimulation and that\nthis effect significantly enhances visibility despite the time lost in\nexposure to the external scene,\" University of Rochester neuroscientist Bin\nYang and colleagues write in their published paper.\n\nPast research has suggested that blinking refreshes our attention, helps with\nobject recognition, and chops an otherwise endless stream of visual and\nauditory information into chunks for processing.\n\nHowever, we also lose our vision in short 300-millisecond blackouts each time\nwe blink, even if we don't notice it happening. You might expect such an\ninterruption to cut through the activity of neurons responsive to visual\ninputs \u2013 but perhaps not in a positive way.\n\nSurprisingly, a 2016 study showed that although neural activity decreases as\neyelids close, it rebounds to a higher level immediately following a blink,\nwhich is thought to enhance vision.\n\nFollowing on from those findings, Yang and colleagues used high-resolution\neye-tracking in this new study to investigate how blinking affects vision in\n12 people who viewed images of varying contrast on a screen.\n\nSince both eyes blink together, only one eye was tracked in each person, and\nthe intensity of light, or luminance, of the participants' visual inputs was\nalso recorded.\n\nRelative to periods where participants fixated on the screen, the researchers\nfound blinks increased the strength of visual input signals by modulating the\nintensity of light falling on the retina.\n\nThis visual boost was seen when participants were instructed to blink and when\nthey did so reflexively. Unlike previous research that found only real blinks\nimproved attention, not simulated ones, changes in luminosity imitating a\nblink also momentarily boosted vision.\n\n\"Rather than impairing visual processing as commonly assumed, blinks enhance\nsensitivity,\" Yang and colleagues report.\n\nWhat's more, the researchers found blinks help reformat visual information,\nsimilar to how other eye movements we're oblivious to (super-fast saccades and\nocular drifts) shape vision by adding spatial markers and 'timestamps' to the\nvideo that is our vision.\n\nConsidering we spend an estimated 10 percent of our waking hours with our eyes\nclosed because of blinking, it's comforting to know that at least it's for a\ngood reason.\n\nThe study has been published in PNAS.\n\nTrending News\n\nFasting-Style Diet Seems to Result in Dynamic Changes to Human Brain Health4\ndays ago\n\nBrain Acidity Linked With Multiple Neurological Disorders Health2 days ago\n\nBreakthrough Parkinson's Gene Discovery Sheds Light on Evolutionary Origin\nHealth1 day ago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
