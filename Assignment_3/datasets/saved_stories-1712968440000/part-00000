The eighteenth-century British polymath has been described as, among\nother things, a historian, a chemist, an educator, a philosopher, a\ntheologian, and a political radical who became, for a period of time, the most\ndespised person in England. Priestley\u2019s many contradictions\u2014as a rationalist\nUnitarian millenarian, as a mild-mannered controversialist, as a thinker who\nwas both ahead of his time and behind it\u2014have provided endless fodder for the\nhistorians who have debated the precise nature of his legacy and his place\namong his fellow Enlightenment intellectuals. But his contributions\u2014however\nthey are categorized\u2014have continued to live on in subtle and surprisingly\nenduring ways, more than two hundred years after his death, at the age of\nseventy, in rural Pennsylvania.\n\nTake, for example, A Chart of Biography, which is considered to be the first\nmodern timeline. This unusual, and unusually beautiful, pedagogical tool,\nwhich was published by Priestley in 1765, while he was in his thirties and\nworking as a tutor at an academy in Warrington, England, tends to get lost in\nthe shuffle of Priestley\u2019s more notable achievements\u2014his seminal 1761 textbook\non language, The Rudiments of English Grammar, say, or his discovery of nine\ngases, including oxygen, 13 years later. But the chart, along with its\ncompanion, A New Chart of History, which Priestley published four years later,\nhas become a curious subject of interest among data visualization aficionados\nwho have analyzed its revolutionary design in academic papers and added it to\nInternet lists of notable infographics. Recently, both charts have become the\nfocus of an NEH-supported digital humanities project, Chronographics: The Time\nCharts of Joseph Priestley, produced by scholars at the University of Oregon.\n\nEven those of us ignorant of (or uninterested in) infographics can look at the\npainstakingly detailed Chart of Biography for a moment or two and appreciate\nhow it has become a source of fascination. The two-foot-by-three-foot, pastel-\nstriped paper scroll\u2014which contains the meticulously inscribed names of\napproximately 2,000 poets, artists, statesmen, and other famous historical\nfigures dating back three millennia\u2014is visually striking, combining a formal,\nsomewhat ornate eighteenth-century aesthetic with the precise organization of\na schematic. Every single one of the chart\u2019s subjects is grouped vertically\ninto one of six occupational categories, then plotted out chronologically\nalong a horizonal line divided into ten-year increments. Despite the huge\nquantity of information it contains, it is extremely user-friendly. Any one of\nPriestley\u2019s history students could run his eye across the chart and\nimmediately gain a sense of the temporal lay of the land. Who came first:\nCopernicus or Newton? How many centuries separate Genghis Khan from Joan of\nArc? Which artists were working during the reign of Henry VIII? The chart was\na masterful blend of form and function, and Priestley knew it.\n\n\u201cPlease now to inspect the Chart, and as soon as you have found the names, you\nsee at one glance, without the help of Arithmetic, or even of words, and in\nthe most clear and perfect manner possible, the relation of these lives to one\nanother in any period of the whole course of them,\u201d he boasted.\n\nPhoto caption\n\n\u201cTo a revolutionary generation intent on inscribing itself in history,\u201d the\nhistorians Daniel Rosenberg and Anthony Grafton wrote, \u201cthe Priestley charts\nseem to have had an almost talismanic appeal.\u201d\n\n\u2014Joseph Priestley\u2019s 1765 A Chart of Biography, Library Company of Philadelphia\n/ University of Oregon\n\nPhoto caption\n\n\u201cTo a revolutionary generation intent on inscribing itself in history,\u201d the\nhistorians Daniel Rosenberg and Anthony Grafton wrote, \u201cthe Priestley charts\nseem to have had an almost talismanic appeal.\u201d\n\n\u2014Joseph Priestley\u2019s 1765 A Chart of Biography, Library Company of Philadelphia\n/ University of Oregon\n\nThe most significant design feature of Priestley\u2019s chart\u2014as historians point\nout\u2014was the way in which he linked units of time to units of distance on the\npage, similar to the way a cartographer uses scale when creating a map. (The\nartist Pietro Lorenzetti lived two hundred years before Titian and thus is\nsituated twice as far from Titian as Jan van Eyck, who predated Titian by\nabout a century.) If this innovation is hard for contemporary viewers to fully\nappreciate, it\u2019s probably because Priestley\u2019s representation of time has\nbecome a convention that\u2019s used everywhere in visual design and seems so\nobvious it\u2019s now taken for granted.\n\nTo Priestley\u2019s contemporaries, though, who were accustomed to cumbersome\nEusebian-style chronological tables or the visually striking but often obscure\n\u201cstream charts\u201d created by the era\u2019s chronographers, Priestley\u2019s method of\ncapturing time on the page revealed something revelatory and new\u2014a way of\nseeing historical patterns and connections that would have otherwise remained\nhidden. \u201cTo many readers,\u201d wrote Daniel Rosenberg and Anthony Grafton in their\nbook, Cartographies of Time, Priestley\u2019s Chart of Biography offered a never-\nbefore-seen \u201cpicture of time itself.\u201d\n\nPhoto caption\n\nPriestley wrote that individuals included in his Chart of Biography were\nselected according to \u201crenown and not merit; acquired fame, and not deserved\nreputation.\u201d\n\n\u2014Detail from Joseph Priestley\u2019s 1765 A Chart of Biography, Library Company of\nPhiladelphia / University of Oregon\n\nPhoto caption\n\nPriestley wrote that individuals included in his Chart of Biography were\nselected according to \u201crenown and not merit; acquired fame, and not deserved\nreputation.\u201d\n\n\u2014Detail from Joseph Priestley\u2019s 1765 A Chart of Biography, Library Company of\nPhiladelphia / University of Oregon\n\nIt was no wonder, then, that eighteenth-century readers found themselves drawn\nto it. A Chart of Biography sold well in both England and the United States,\naccruing many fans along the way. Along with the New Chart of History, it\nwould go on to be printed in at least 19 editions and spawn numerous\nimitations, including one by Priestley\u2019s future friend Thomas Jefferson, who\ndeveloped his own \u201ctime chart\u201d of market seasons in Washington, and the\nhistorian David Ramsay, who acknowledged Priestley\u2019s influence in his\nHistorical and Biographical Chart of the United States. The time charts marked\nPriestley\u2019s first major commercial success and played a key role in\nestablishing his reputation as a serious intellectual, earning him an honorary\ndegree from the University of Edinburgh, and helping him secure a fellowship\nnomination to the Royal Society of London.\n\nAs much as anything he published, and he published a staggering\namount\u2014somewhere between 150 and 200 books, articles, papers, and\npamphlets\u2014Priestley\u2019s time charts encapsulate his uniqueness as a thinker. Of\nhis many intellectual gifts, his gift for synthesis\u2014for knitting together the\nseemingly disparate things that caught his attention\u2014might have been his\ngreatest. On any given subject, his biographer Robert Schofield observed,\nPriestley had \u201ccontemporaries who were more profound and analytic,\u201d but he\n\u201cmade systematic and operational what had been fragmentary, frequently\nimpractical, and unused before him.\u201d\n\nThe charts, which he energetically promoted, also serve as a perfect example\nof the man\u2019s seemingly compulsive need to share the knowledge he acquired with\nothers. \u201cThe proper employment of men of letters,\u201d he once wrote, \u201cis either\nmaking new discoveries, in order to extend the bounds of human knowledge; or\nfacilitating the communication of the discoveries which have been made\nalready, in order to make an acquaintance with science more general among\nmankind.\u201d\n\nIn this regard, he wholeheartedly practiced what he preached. After Benjamin\nFranklin\u2019s 1751 book on electricity piqued his interested in the subject,\nPriestley finagled an introduction to the book\u2019s famous author, then proceeded\nto research and publish his own 700-page tome on the subject\u2014a \u201chistory of the\ndiscoveries in electricity,\u201d complete with his own experiments for interested\nreaders. When the book\u2019s plates required an illustrator, and he was unable to\nfind a satisfactory one, he taught himself perspective drawing, then published\na 1770 tutorial for aspiring artists titled A Familiar Introduction to the\nTheory and Practice of Perspective. (Fun fact: Priestley is often credited\nwith discovering the erasing properties of rubber, as well as with naming the\nsubstance, which was perfectly suited for \u201crubbing\u201d away errant pencil marks.)\n\nA bit of dabbling in the subject of optics followed, along with a history of\nthe field, published in 1772. That same year, after explaining to friends over\ndinner one night how he could \u201csweeten\u201d water by using a pig\u2019s bladder to\ninfuse it with carbon dioxide, he produced the 34-page illustrated pamphlet\n\u201cDirections for Impregnating Water with Fixed Air.\u201d \u201cTo make this process more\ngenerally known,\u201d he wrote in its preface, \u201cand that more frequent trials may\nbe made of water thus medicated, at land as well as at sea, I have been\ninduced to make the present publication.\u201d\n\nPriestley\u2019s \u201cPyrmont water\u201d\u2014or what\u2019s commonly known today as carbonated\nwater\u2014was an instant hit in England and France and contributed to his\nreceiving the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1773. Bolstered by the\nmistaken belief that the water contained antiscorbutic properties, Britain\u2019s\nRoyal College of Physicians instructed Captain James Cook to test out the\ncarbonation process on his upcoming second sea voyage. Regardless of whether\nCook actually carried out the experiment\u2014sources conflict on this point\u2014it was\ndoomed to failure. Priestley\u2019s fizzy Pyrmont water had no more vitamin C in it\nthan uncarbonated flat water, and so it was equally useless when it came to\npreventing scurvy. But it was an unconventional, and thus fitting, way to mark\nPriestley\u2019s foray into yet another scientific discipline. Schofield noted\nwryly: \u201cThis is the work for which Priestley became known to the world as a\nchemist; a description of how to make \u2018soda water,\u2019 wrongly assumed to have\nmedicinal value.\u201d\n\nPriestley turns up in another intriguing footnote related to Cook\u2019s famous\n1772 voyage\u2014which is that he was, briefly, offered the opportunity to join the\nexpedition as one of the ship\u2019s astronomers. The invitation, which was\nextended to Priestley in a letter from the legendary botanist Joseph Banks, is\nthe kind of tantalizing \u201cwhat if\u201d that counterfactual history is made from.\nWho knows what other subjects Priestley would have set his sights on if he\u2019d\nhad the opportunity to travel the globe?\n\nPhoto caption\n\nElectricity was just one of many natural phenomena that fascinated Priestley.\nThis electrical machine he designed \u201cfor amateur experimentalists\u201d appeared in\na 1768 book written to educate the public about the subject.\n\n\u2014Wikimedia / Wellcome Library, London.

Wellcome Images\n\nA few weeks after receiving Banks\u2019s invitation, the offer was rescinded. The\nreason was never fully made clear, but Priestley had a theory. \u201cMr. Banks,\u201d he\nwould write in a memoir that was published two years after his death,\n\u201cinformed me that I had been objected to by some clergymen . . . on account of\nmy religious principles.\u201d\n\nThis may or may not have actually been the case. (Schofield contends that\nBanks jumped the gun, inviting Priestley to join the expedition without being\nauthorized to do so.) But Priestley\u2019s assumption was an understandable one. He\nwas a nonconformist minister and a member of England\u2019s Protestant Dissenter\nminority, one that opposed state involvement in religious issues, refused to\nsubscribe to the Anglican church\u2019s doctrine, and, as result, faced\ndiscrimination. (Dissenters like Priestley were, for instance, prohibited from\nmatriculating at the University of Oxford or Cambridge until the nineteenth\ncentury.)\n\nAnd Priestley\u2019s heterodox religious views were a matter of public record. He\nwas, by that point, a seasoned veteran of the era\u2019s pamphlet wars, having\nembroiled himself in controversy with his 1768 A Free Address to Protestant\nDissenters on the Subject of the Lord\u2019s Supper before going on, two years\nlater, to attack major aspects of Calvinist doctrine in An Appeal to the\nSerious and Candid Professors of Christianity. Over the next two decades, his\nnotoriety would only grow as he published a series of \u201cbrilliantly\ncontroversial works,\u201d wrote the historian David Wykes, which \u201cadvanc[ed] ideas\nthat caught up and convinced many of his readers and a generation of young\nministers\u201d but which also unleashed \u201ca storm of anger.\u201d Orthodox readers were\nnot particularly keen to hear Priestley analyze the logical flaws he had\ndiscovered in the doctrine of atonement or to hear him out as he explained the\nways in which their beliefs regarding the Holy Trinity were \u201cinconsistent with\nreason and common sense.\u201d In 1785, three years after it was published, his\nbook An History of the Corruptions of Christianity was banned in Holland.\n\nFar from silencing him, the barrage of angry responses goaded Priestley into\npicking up his pen and producing more pamphlets filled with more arguments.\n\u201cHe entered each controversy with a cheerful conviction that he was right,\nwhile most of his opponents were convinced, from the outset, that he was\nwillfully and maliciously wrong,\u201d Schofield wrote. \u201cHe was able, then, to\ncontrast his sweet reasonableness to their personal rancor while responding,\nin kind to irony and sarcasm.\u201d\n\nPriestley\u2019s religious provocations, combined with a potent mix of unpopular\npolitical views\u2014his support for the American and French revolutions, his\ncriticism of the slave trade, his commitment to religious liberty for\nDissenters, his agitation for parliamentary reform\u2014only served to cement his\nreputation, first as a radical, and then as a dangerous menace. By 1790, his\nenemies had come to see the soft-spoken minister as \u201cthe devil incarnate,\u201d\nwrote Wykes. It was a comparison that Priestley, perhaps unwisely, did not shy\naway from. \u201cIf he really took me to be that malicious Being, above described,\u201d\nhe wrote gleefully of one of his foes, \u201che should not have trodden upon my\ncloven foot, or have kicked me so near my tail, without remembering that I had\nhorns, and he had none.\u201d\n\nHad he known what was coming, he might not have found it so amusing. One\nevening in the following July, Priestley received a warning that a large\nnumber of protestors had attacked a group of diners attending a Bastille Day\ncelebration at the Birmingham Hotel. From there, the mob\u2014which had grown\nsignificantly larger\u2014moved on to destroy the Unitarian meeting house where\nPriestley presided as minister, ripping out the pews and setting them on fire.\nAnd, it seemed, they were now on their way to the Priestley residence. There\nwas no time for Priestley and his wife to do anything but flee, and then watch\nas a crowd converged on their house and proceeded, with some difficulty, to\nburn it to the ground. \u201cIt being a remarkably calm, and clear moon-light,\u201d\nPriestley recalled later:\n\n> We could see to a considerable distance, and being upon a rising ground, we\n> distinctly heard all that passed at the house, every shout of the mob, and\n> almost every stroke of the instruments they had provided for breaking the\n> doors and the furniture. For they could not get any fire, though one of them\n> was heard to offer two guineas for a lighted candle; my son, whom we had\n> left behind us, having taken the precaution to put out all the fires in the\n> house, and others of my friends got all the neighbours to do the same. I\n> afterwards heard that much pains was taken, but without effect, to get fire\n> from my large electrical machine, which stood in the library.\n\nThe attack on Priestley was personal\u2014but it also wasn\u2019t. Over the next several\ndays, widespread terror and looting would engulf Birmingham as rioters clashed\nwith local constables, targeting and destroying some two dozen homes,\nbusinesses, and churches belonging to prominent Dissenters and supporters of\nthe French Revolution before authorities finally called in military dragoons\nto restore order. In the end, the violent events of July 1791 would come to be\nknown as the Priestley riots, after their most high-profile victim, and the\nman who symbolized everything his \u201cChurch and King\u201d enemies despised.\n\nOn one of Priestley\u2019s sweeping timelines, a few days of riots would not merit\neven a speck of ink. As a historian, Priestley was well aware of this fact.\nMore than two decades earlier, long before his home and nearly all his worldly\npossessions were destroyed, he had studied the rise and fall of empires,\nmapped out across his New Chart of History, and attempted to counsel his\nreaders about the lessons he had found there. \u201cWhat a number of revolutions\nare marked upon it!\u201d he wrote:\n\n> What torrents of human blood has the restless ambition of mortals shed, and\n> in what complicated distress has the discontent of powerful individuals\n> involved a great part of their species! Let us deplore this depravity of\n> human passions . . . but let not the dark strokes which disfigure the fair\n> face of an historical chart affect our faith in the great and comfortable\n> doctrine of an over-ruling Providence.\n\nIn the weeks and months following the riots, this sense of perspective would\nbe put to the test. The mob had destroyed not only Priestley\u2019s home, his\nvaluable collection of manuscripts, and his beloved, expensive lab equipment\n(worth around $115,000 in today\u2019s dollars), but also whatever illusions he\nmight once have harbored about his own safety. Far from cooling the depraved\nhuman passions against him, the historian Wykes wrote, the events in\nBirmingham had turned him into \u201ca national figure of hate.\u201d\n\nPhoto caption\n\nPriestley (shown here in a 1791 cartoon) invited controversy with his\nunconventional political and religious views, including his support for the\nFrench Revolution. Targeted by a mob in Birmingham and pilloried in the press,\nhe was forced to flee England in the summer of 1794.\n\n\u2014Science History Images / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nPriestley was satirized in caricatures, burned in effigies with his fellow\nradical, Thomas Paine. His adult sons were forced to flee the country. The\nprosecutions of fellow Dissenters that followed over the next few years were\nparticularly frightening. \u201cIt shews that no man who is obnoxious,\u201d he fretted\nin a 1793 letter, \u201chowever innocent, is safe.\u201d And so, the following spring,\nat the age of sixty-one, he became a political refugee, following his sons\nJoseph and Harry across the Atlantic, where he was met with a hero\u2019s welcome\nin the United States, eventually settling down with his family in the small\ntown of Northumberland, one hundred forty miles northwest of Philadelphia, to\nassume the quiet life of a farmer.\n\nBut farming didn\u2019t suit Priestley and neither did quiet. Over the next several\nyears, Priestley found himself back in political hot water, clashing this time\nwith his friend John Adams and the Federalists, in danger, at one point, of\nbeing deported from the very country that had just offered him asylum. (Adams\nblamed Priestley\u2019s Letters to the Inhabitants of Northumberland for\ncontributing to his 1800 electoral defeat to Jefferson.) In his adopted\nhomeland, Priestley returned to his scientific work with renewed zeal, but\nthat, too, proved to be controversial, as he produced paper after paper\nattacking the experiments of his fellow chemists, who had moved on from\nPriestley\u2019s outdated theory of \u201cdephlogisticated air\u201d to follow the more\nquantitative approach of scientists like Antoine Lavoisier. In doing so,\nSchofield observed, Priestley was \u201cperversely fighting the new chemistry based\non his discoveries\u201d in a way that would come to exasperate even his admirers.\nIn a eulogy written for the Acad\u00e9mie Nationale des Sciences, the zoologist\nGeorges Cuvier would famously proclaim Priestley to be \u201cthe father of modern\nchemistry [who] never acknowledged his daughter.\u201d\n\nThe century-old theory Priestley relied upon during his pneumatic\nexperiments\u2014which postulated that all flammable substances contained an\nelement called phlogiston that was released into the surrounding air during\ncombustion\u2014proved to be wrong in the end. But the work he conducted in the\nfinal decade of his life was not a wasted effort, says Schofield. By\nrelentlessly hounding his critics, by probing for the weak spots in their\narguments, he had \u201cforced the tightening of their experimental evidence,\u201d and\ncompelled them to up their scientific game. Surely that fact would have\noffered him some satisfaction. He understood that the pursuit of knowledge was\nnot a solitary one. Even the most famous individuals, the ones whose\naccomplishments fill the pages of books, the ones whose names adorn charts of\nhistory, he once wrote, \u201cenjoy . . . the labours and discoveries of others\u201d\nbefore they \u201cgo off the stage,\u201d leaving their work behind, to be advanced by\nthose who follow them.\n\nPriestley labored as long as possible, through deteriorating health and\nadvancing old age, continuing to conduct experiments until he was unable to\nleave his bed. On February 6, 1804, he called his assistant to his side with\none final request for help on revisions to an unfinished manuscript that\nrequired his attention. He worked until he had assured himself that he had\nfinished what was needed. \u201cThat is right,\u201d he said. \u201cI have now done.\u201d Minutes\nlater, he was gone.\n\nAbout the author\n\nAlyson Foster is an associate editor of Humanities magazine.\n\n### Funding information\n\nIn 2020, NEH awarded a Digital Humanities grant in the amount of $99,985, to\nDaniel Blake Rosenberg of the University of Oregon and Anthony Grafton of\nPrinceton University to develop The Time Charts of Joseph Priestley, a\ndigital, interactive reconstruction of Joseph Priestley\u2019s influential\ninfographics, A Chart of Biography and A New Chart of History.
