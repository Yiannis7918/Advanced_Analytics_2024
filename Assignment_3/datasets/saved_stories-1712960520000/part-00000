In line with AWS\u2019 efforts to optimize customers\u2019 cloud bills last year, the cloud giant is looking to help ease costs as generative AI workloads grow.\n  * Chips that support compute-intensive workloads are still a key part of its strategy, too. \u201cCustomers have asked us to push the envelope on price-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips,\u201d Jassy said.\n\n### Dive Insight:\n\nTo meet the moment, Amazon is investing heavily in the technology to help\ncustomers, no matter the AWS adoption route, from turnkey tools to heavier\nlifts, Jassy said.\n\n\u201cMuch of the early public attention has focused on GenAI applications, with\nthe remarkable 2022 launch of ChatGPT,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cBut ... there are three\ndistinct layers in the GenAI stack, each of which is gigantic, and each of\nwhich we\u2019re deeply investing.\u201d\n\nThe three layers are separated by how customers approach adoption, such as\nenterprises opting to build foundational models; those looking to customize an\nexisting model with internal data on Bedrock; and customers seeking generative\nAI-powered tools.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundation model,\u201d\nJassy said. AWS services \"will empower internal and external builders to\ntransform virtually every customer experience that we know.\u201d\n\nTo get customers on board, AWS is trying to clear the path to entry, from\ncosts to chip supply issues.\n\nWhile AWS customers began to show signs of increased spending and lengthier\ndeals at the end of 2023, Jassy said, cost optimization is still a priority.\n\nAWS drove down prices for general cloud computing with specialized chips and\nis now doing the same for generative AI with Trainium and Inferentia to\ndifferentiate itself amid an AI arms race amongst providers.\n\nThe company has also targeted cost reduction by relaxing discount pricing\nrestrictions and waiving egress fees.\n\n  * post\n  * share\n  * tweet\n  * print\n  * email\n  * license\n\nFiled Under: Cloud, AI & Future Tech\n\n### CIO Dive news delivered to your inbox\n\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n### Editors' picks\n\n  * Permission granted by Slack\n\n### Slack launches AI upgrades for enterprise customers\n\nThe company tested the features with thousands of users since September and\nestimated the features saved teams 97 minutes per week on average.\n\nBy Lindsey Wilkinson \u2022 Feb. 14, 2024\n\n  * Eric Thayer via Getty Images\n\n### Apple isn\u2019t ready to enter the generative AI fray, yet\n\nCEO Tim Cook said the company is working with the technology internally but\nwill wait until later this year to announce customer-facing updates.\n\nBy Lindsey Wilkinson \u2022 Feb. 2, 2024\n\n### Get the free newsletter\n\nSubscribe to CIO Dive for top news, trends & analysis\n\n### Most Popular\n\n  1.
