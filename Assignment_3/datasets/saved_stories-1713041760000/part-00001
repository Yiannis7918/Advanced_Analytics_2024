Despite this simple training\n> objective, they have led to revolutionary advances in natural language\n> processing. Underlying this success is the self-attention mechanism. In this\n> work, we ask: \\textit{What} \\textit{does} \\textit{a} \\textit{single}\n> \\textit{self-attention} \\textit{layer} \\textit{learn} \\textit{from}\n> \\textit{next-token} \\textit{prediction?} We show that training self-\n> attention with gradient descent learns an automaton which generates the next\n> token in two distinct steps: \\textbf{(1)} \\textbf{Hard} \\textbf{retrieval:}\n> Given input sequence, self-attention precisely selects the \\textit{high-\n> priority} \\textit{input} \\textit{tokens} associated with the last input\n> token. \\textbf{(2)} \\textbf{Soft} \\textbf{composition:} It then creates a\n> convex combination of the high-priority tokens from which the next token can\n> be sampled. Under suitable conditions, we rigorously characterize these\n> mechanics through a directed graph over tokens extracted from the training\n> data. We prove that gradient descent implicitly discovers the strongly-\n> connected components (SCC) of this graph and self-attention learns to\n> retrieve the tokens that belong to the highest-priority SCC available in the\n> context window. Our theory relies on decomposing the model weights into a\n> directional component and a finite component that correspond to hard\n> retrieval and soft composition steps respectively. This also formalizes a\n> related implicit bias formula conjectured in [Tarzanagh et al. 2023]. We\n> hope that these findings shed light on how self-attention processes\n> sequential data and pave the path toward demystifying more complex\n> architectures.\n\nComments:| Accepted to AISTATS 2024  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nComputation and Language (cs.CL); Optimization and Control (math.OC)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2403.08081 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2403.08081v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.08081arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Yingcong Li [view email] [v1] Tue, 12 Mar 2024 21:15:38 UTC (5,721 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Mechanics of Next Token Prediction with Self-\nAttention, by Yingcong Li and 4 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2403\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.CL math math.OC\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
