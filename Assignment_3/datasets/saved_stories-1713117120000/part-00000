But for West African cocoa farmers, it\u2019s\nnot exactly a windfall.\n\nIn a small town near the border of the Osun and Ondo states of Nigeria,\nOlasunkanmi Abdulwahab, known to everyone as Baba, watches cars zoom by on the\nroad. When a lorry trudges past us, we can smell its contents: sharp, musty,\nearthy. It\u2019s cocoa \u2014 one of the most valuable crops in the world in recent\nmonths.\n\nAs Baba\u2019s eyes trail the truck into the distance, he estimates the bounty.\n\n\u201cThat is 33 million naira crawling on,\u201d he says, the equivalent of ~$26k.\n\nOn this morning in March, cocoa futures reached 12k per kilogram or 12m naira\nper metric ton (~$9.6k), more than 3x its price in the last quarter of 2023\nand nearly 5x more than in the last quarter of 2022.\n\nNorth Americans and Europeans noticed the uptick around Easter, when the\nprices of popular chocolate products were up as much as 50%. Some analysts\nsuggest chocolate may end up a luxury product, at least for the near future,\nas sellers like Hershey and Mondelez raise prices.\n\nThe Hustle\n\nBut for farmers in West Africa, where the majority of the globe\u2019s cocoa is\ngrown, the higher prices have been a mixed blessing. While rejoicing over the\nsoaring rates, they\u2019ve been held back by severe weather, rising rents, and\ngovernment price regulations. Some farmers, like Baba, have invested in their\nfarms, hoping the record prices will continue for this fall\u2019s harvest.\n\n#### Higher prices and higher rents\n\nBaba talks about the price increase like it was bound to happen. And it\nbasically was.\n\nIn 2022, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine led to roughly half of Europe\u2019s\nfertilizer production going dormant. Fertilizers became cost-prohibitive to\nmost West African farmers, says Baba, who stopped using fertilizer completely.\n\nAt the same time, radical weather patterns didn\u2019t help. El Ni\u00f1o brought heavy\nrainfall followed by heat and drought, devastating cacao trees. Cacao trees\ngrow fruits called pods that are filled with cocoa seeds (or beans) that can\nbe processed into chocolate.\n\nBy early 2024, months after the fall harvest, it became clear farmers had far\nfewer crops than normal. Compared to the originally predicted output for the\n2023-24 season, cocoa production is expected to fall by:\n\n  * 40% in Ghana\n  * 30% in Nigeria\n\nIn C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the first quarter output this year was 29% lower than the\nsame period in 2023.\n\nThe Hustle\n\nOn Baba\u2019s primary farm in Nigeria, he ended up yielding two metric tons of\ncocoa last year, about one metric ton less than normal.\n\n\u201cYou work the same, the trees just yield less,\u201d Baba says.\n\nIn 2023, cocoa sold at an estimated 50% more than it had the year before in\nNigeria, but the increase wasn\u2019t enough to protect Baba from the country\u2019s\nsevere inflation and economic malaise. By the time Baba was done tending to\nexpenses and getting ready for a new growing season, he had no expendable\nincome left.\n\nHis story isn\u2019t uncommon, as the soaring chocolate prices in Europe and the US\ndidn\u2019t match what farmers saw throughout West Africa.\n\nCountries like Cameroon and Ghana set fixed prices for cocoa farmers called\nfarmgates. When prices are low, these measures help protect farmers, most of\nwhom do not earn a living wage in Ghana. But the farmgates were set before the\nmarket spiked, with prices for farmers in those countries at about one-third\nof what cocoa fetches on the open market.\n\nBaba stands near one of the seedling clusters in the nursery near his farm.\n(Olatunji Olaigbe)\n\nOn top of that, rent and property rates have increased.\n\nIn the past years, Olowolagba Rafiu has paid an annual rent of 150k naira\n(~$120) on three hectares of farmland. This year, his landlords asked for 500k\nnaira, and he was able to negotiate down to 350k. Baba typically pays a tax of\n30k naira on his land; this year he\u2019ll be paying over 100k naira.\n\nMeanwhile, during last year\u2019s harvest season, theft got so bad that farmers in\nsome communities set up security task forces to prevent pods from being stolen\ndirectly on trees in the forests.\n\n\u201cWhen it became hard to steal pods directly from the tree, they started\nstealing beans left outside to dry,\u201d says John Achidi, a Cameroonian farmer.\n\u201cYou get to farm in the morning and find all your trees stripped bare.\u201d\n\n#### Optimism and investments for 2024\n\nStill, as West African farmers plan for the fall 2024 harvest, many see green\nshoots.\n\nIn C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana, the government is planning to increase farmgate\nprices by as much as 50%. And Nigerian farmers are trying to cash in while\ncocoa prices are still inflated.\n\nRafiu invested in fertilizers for parts of his farms that he neglected when\nprices were high.\n\nTaiwo, a 28-year-old farmer who works for a cooperative cocoa farm in\nAbeokuta, Nigeria says the farm has over 30k seedlings in the nursery, up from\nthe 10k they usually average per year. Achidi says he\u2019s planning to farm a new\nparcel of land starting next season.\n\nTaiwo tends to newly planted seedlings in the nursery area of his co-op farm.\n(Olatunji Olaigbe)\n\nBut will it be a dead end? Yusuf Abosede, head of Landmark Farmbiz, an\ninternational agro-trade firm, says the increased productivity will reduce\nscarcity and prices, albeit to levels still higher than most farmers are\naccustomed to.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way you go from 12k back to 3k per kilogram, but things will come\nto around 5k per kilogram by the end of this year,\u201d he says.\n\nThere\u2019s also a question of how much cocoa West African farmers will be able to\nproduce in the future. The crop is native to Latin America but was introduced\ninto the region from colonists, becoming a significant cash crop in the\nmid-20th century.\n\nAlthough cocoa grows particularly well in the forests of West Africa, studies\nshow that climate change and environmental damage have caused the West African\nforest regions to endure weaker rains and longer dry seasons.\n\n\u201cWe sometimes forget that cocoa is not native to West Africa; it\u2019s not hardy\nlike our indigenous crops,\u201d Abosede says. \u201c[If there\u2019s] small discomfort...\nproduction plunges by a ridiculously wide margin.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, Baba has worked through record heat and spasmodic, severe\nrainfalls. He would have sprayed to prevent moss during the periods of high\nrain, but the herbicide he needs has increased from ~40k naira per gallon in\n2018 to over 250k naira.\n\nThis spring on his farm, the only cacao plants fruiting were the ones on the\nmost fertile land at the edge of the rivers and water beds.\n\nPods fruiting on one of Baba\u2019s cacao trees. (Olatunji Olaigbe)\n\nDespite the challenges, the record-setting prices for cocoa have imbued him\nwith optimism. With hopes of a higher payday this year, he splurged by buying\nfertilizer and herbicide and investing in new seedlings to replace dead trees\nand expand the farm.\n\nOn that day in March, after the lorry passed, Baba made a sharp turn into an\nalmost invisible trail by the roadside, into one of his cocoa plots in the\nforest.\n\n\u201cOf all the things you can plant in this world,\u201d he says, \u201ccocoa is the best.\u201d\n\nTopics: Food\n\n## Follow us on social media\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * ### How One Professor\u2019s Lecture Launched a Food Movement\n\nSep 19, 2020\n\n  * ### How We Launched a Physical Product in 3 Months\n\nSep 19, 2020\n\n  * ### The radical transformation of the avocado\n\nApr 05, 2024\n\n  * ### Did SunnyD really turn a girl orange?\n\nMar 22, 2024\n\n  * ### The curious case of the disappearing Hydrox cookies\n\nJan 08, 2024\n\n  * ### Why the world\u2019s best vanilla is so easy to steal\n\nAug 15, 2023\n\n  * ### How nuns got squeezed out of the communion wafer business\n\nJul 21, 2023\n\n  * ### How One Professor\u2019s Lecture Launched a Food Movement\n\nSep 19, 2020\n\n  * ### How We Launched a Physical Product in 3 Months\n\nSep 19, 2020\n\n  * ### The radical transformation of the avocado\n\nApr 05, 2024\n\n  * ### Did SunnyD really turn a girl orange?\n\nMar 22, 2024\n\n## Get Smarter on Business and Tech Thanks for subscribing!\n\nGet the 5-minute newsletter keeping 2M+ innovators in the loop.\n\nWant even more business resources?
