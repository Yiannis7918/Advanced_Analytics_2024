But lately it is Chinese researchers working at US\nuniversities who are increasingly reporting interrogations \u2013 and in several\ncases deportations \u2013 at US airports, despite holding valid work or study visas\nfor scientific research.\n\nEarlier this month the Chinese embassy in Washington said more than 70\nstudents \u201cwith legal and valid materials\u201d had been deported from the US since\nJuly 2021, with more than 10 cases since November 2023. The embassy said it\nhad complained to the US authorities about each case.\n\nThe exact number of incidents is difficult to verify, as the US Customs and\nBorder Protection (CBP) agency does not provide detailed statistics about\nrefusals at airports. A spokesperson said that \u201call international travellers\nattempting to enter the United States, including all US citizens, are subject\nto examination\u201d.\n\nBut testimonies have circulated on Chinese social media, and academics are\nbecoming increasingly outspoken about what they say is the unfair treatment of\ntheir colleagues and students.\n\n\u201cThe impact is huge,\u201d says Qin Yan, a professor of pathology at Yale School of\nMedicine in Connecticut, who says that he is aware of more than a dozen\nChinese students from Yale and other universities who have been rejected by\nthe US in recent months, despite holding valid visas. Experiments have\nstalled, and there is a \u201cchilling effect\u201d for the next generation of Chinese\nscientists.\n\nThe number of people affected is a tiny fraction of the total number of\nChinese students in the US. The State Department issued nearly 300,000 visas\nto Chinese students in the year to September 2023. But the personal accounts\nspeak to a broader concern that people-to-people exchanges between the world\u2019s\ntwo biggest economies and scientific leaders are straining.\n\nThe refusals appear to be linked to a 2020 US rule that barred Chinese\npostgraduate students with links to China\u2019s \u201cmilitary-civil fusion strategy\u201d,\nwhich aims to leverage civilian infrastructure to support military\ndevelopment. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute thinktank estimates\nthat 95 civilian universities in China have links to the defence sector.\n\nNearly 2,000 visas applications were rejected on that basis in 2021. But now\npeople who pass the security checks necessary to be granted a visa by the\nState Department are being turned away at the border by CBP, a different\nbranch of government.\n\n\u201cIt is very hard for a CBP officer to really evaluate the risk of espionage,\u201d\nsaid Dan Berger, an immigration lawyer in Massachusetts, who represents a\ngraduate student at Yale who, midway through her PhD, was sent back from\nWashington\u2019s Dulles airport in December, and banned from re-entering the US\nfor five years.\n\n\u201cIt is sudden,\u201d Berger said. \u201cShe has an apartment in the US. Thankfully, she\ndoesn\u2019t have a cat. But there are experiments that were in progress.\u201d\n\nAcademics say that scrutiny has widened to different fields \u2013 particularly\nmedical sciences \u2013 with the reasons for the refusals not made clear.\n\nX Edward Guo, a professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia University,\nsaid that part of the problem is that, unlike in the US, military research\ndoes sometimes take place on university campuses. \u201cIt\u2019s not black and white\n... there are medical universities that also do military. But 99% of those\nprofessors are doing biomedical research and have nothing to do with the\nmilitary.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cif you want to come to the US to study AI, forget it,\u201d Guo said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Observed\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best\nObserver writers\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Harvard Medical\nSchool declined to confirm or comment on the specifics of individual cases,\nbut said that \u201cdecisions regarding entry into the United States are under the\npurview of the federal government and outside of the school\u2019s and the\nuniversity\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nThe increased scrutiny comes as Beijing and Washington are struggling to come\nto an agreement about the US-China Science and Technology Agreement, a\nlandmark treaty signed in 1979 that governs scientific cooperation between the\ntwo countries. Normally renewed every five years, since August it has been\nsputtering through six-month extensions.\n\nBut following years of scrutiny from the Department of Justice investigation\ninto funding links to China, and a rise in anti-Asian sentiment during the\npandemic, ethnically Chinese scientists say the atmosphere is becoming\nincreasingly hostile.\n\n\u201cBefore 2016, I felt like I\u2019m just an American,\u201d said Guo, who became a\nnaturalised US citizen in the late 1990s. \u201cThis is really the first time I\u2019ve\nthought, OK, you\u2019re an American but you\u2019re not exactly an American.\u201d\n\nAdditional research by Chi Hui Lin\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * US national security\n  * The Observer\n  * China\n  * Asia Pacific\n  * US politics\n  * US justice system\n  * US immigration\n  * US foreign policy\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
