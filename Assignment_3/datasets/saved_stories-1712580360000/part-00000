Theoretically, Antarctica would be located in all time zones;\nhowever, areas south of the Antarctic Circle experience extreme day-night\ncycles near the times of the June and December solstices, making it difficult\nto determine which time zone would be appropriate. For practical purposes time\nzones are usually based on territorial claims; however, many stations use the\ntime of the country that owns them or the time zone of their supply base\n(e.g., McMurdo Station and Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station use New Zealand\ntime due to their main supply base being Christchurch, New Zealand).^[1] In\nmost areas south of 80 degrees latitude, Coordinated Universal Time is assumed\ndespite the limited presence of clocks.\n\n## TZ database[edit]\n\nThe file zone.tab of the tz database contains the following zones, columns\nmarked with * contain data from the file zone.tab. Only permanently inhabited\nstations are tracked by the tz database staff.

Its usage would also further complicate communication with the\nclaimant countries in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nHowever, a few regions such as the Ross Dependency and, formerly, Palmer Land,\nobserve the time and use of DST of the countries they are supplied from, New\nZealand and Chile, respectively.^[1] The areas have DST during the southern\nsummer, when there is the northern winter, including January.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b \"Local Time \u2192 Antarctica @ Time Genie\".
