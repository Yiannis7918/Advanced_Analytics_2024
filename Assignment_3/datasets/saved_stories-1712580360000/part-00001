By the time he crossed the line at Tunisia\u2019s most northerly point,\nRas Angela, he had run the distance of about 376 marathons.\n\nCook was accompanied on the final leg by supporters who had flown out after\nfollowing his journey on social media, as he documented his odyssey on X,\nInstagram and YouTube, with posts amassing millions of views.\n\nHe finished to cheers of \u201cGeezer, Geezer\u201d and took a well-deserved dip in the\nsea, telling Sky News: \u201cI\u2019m a little bit tired.\u201d\n\nMap of Russ Cook's run\n\nOn the eve of his final leg, Cook told Sky News: \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard to put into\nwords: 352 days on the road, long time without seeing my family, my\ngirlfriend, my body is in a lot of pain but one more day, I\u2019m not about to\ncomplain.\u201d\n\nMoney raised will go to the Running Charity, which provides running and mental\nhealth programmes to young people experiencing homelessness and complex needs,\nand Sandblast, which promotes awareness of the Saharawi people.\n\nDuring Cook\u2019s feat he ran through rainforests, across mountain ranges and\ntraversed the Sahara. On day 200, he reduced his daily mileage on doctors\u2019\nadvice in Nigeria. \u201cI took a couple of days to get some scans. No bone damage\nso figured the only option left was to stop mincing about like a little\nweasel, get the strongest painkillers available and zombie stomp road again,\u201d\nhe said at the time.\n\nVisa problems getting into Algeria were overcome after his appeal video on X\nwas seen by 11 million people and the Algerian embassy in the UK announced he\nwould be given a courtesy visa.\n\nHe was due to celebrate with a finish-line party at a hotel in Bizerte,\nTunisia. \u201cGet your daiquiris ready, girls and boys, this is gonna be mega,\u201d he\nwrote.\n\nBefore setting off on his challenge, Cook revealed he wanted to make a\ndifference, saying: \u201cI\u2019m a totally normal bloke, so if I can do this,\nhopefully people can apply this to their own lives in whichever way they\nchoose. For 99% of people, it\u2019s not going to be running across Africa, but it\nmight look like chasing their dreams a little bit more.\u201d\n\nHe has called the challenge \u201cthe toughest in my life but an immense honour\u201d,\nadding: \u201cWe have met incredible people in every single country we\u2019ve been to\nthat have welcomed us with love and kindness. The human spirit is a beautiful\nthing.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to First Edition\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s\nhappening and why it matters\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

That is his personality.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are squeamish, the images of his feet are quite horrific at times,\u201d\nEagle added. Of the challenges, he said: \u201cThe scale of it. You hear it, but\nyou don\u2019t really comprehend it. He\u2019s just consistently been able to bring his\nmind to it, to get up every day and do that. It\u2019s just awe-inspiring.\u201d\n\nThe charity plans a group run on his return and Cook will also be running the\nLondon Marathon with young people from the charity. \u201cI think that will be a\nwalk in the park for him,\u201d Eagle said.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Africa\n  * Running\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### \u2018I never thought I would get this far\u2019: London man runs 365 marathons in 365 days\n\n17 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### Did Tigist Assefa\u2019s \u2018super shoes\u2019 make her a record-breaking marathon winner?\n\n25 Sept 2023\n\n  * ### Mexico City Marathon expels 11,000 runners for cutting sections of course\n\n6 Sept 2023\n\n  * ### Midnight runners: the athletes up late to beat the scorching heat\n\n30 Aug 2023\n\n  * ### The slow running revolution: how to move at a \u2018sexy\u2019 pace \u2013 and really enjoy the race\n\n24 Jul 2023\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Should I worry about running damaging my knees?\n\n2 Jul 2023\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### When my running app broke it was a revelation: \u2018being better\u2019 is about taking care of yourself\n\n29 May 2023\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### London Marathon 2023: \u2018very wet\u2019 rainy weather forecast\n\n23 Apr 2023\n\n  * ### Celebrate yourself \u2013 and try a naked 5k! 30 ways to make fitness more fun\n\n20 Apr 2023\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### \u2018A precision approach to activism\u2019: distance runners join fight against Africa\u2019s air pollution\n\n19 Apr 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
