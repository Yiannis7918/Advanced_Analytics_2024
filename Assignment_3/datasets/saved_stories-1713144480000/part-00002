Health professionals have found\nthemselves administering anti-aging treatments to an ever-younger clientele\n\nComedian Chelsea Handler has spoken publicly about having used Ozempic, which\nshe considers \u201cmiraculous.\"Jeff Kravitz (FilmMagic)\n\nAmaia Odriozola\n\nApr 14, 2024 - 04:00CEST\n\nCatherine Deneuve warned us when she herself was approaching 60: \u201cAt a certain\nage, you have to choose between your face or your ass.\u201d A half century later,\njudging from the latest red carpets, it\u2019s easy to tell that Hollywood has\nopted for the latter. At the Oscar gala earlier this month, host Jimmy Kimmel\ndelivered the gag of the evening: \u201cEverybody looks so great. When I look\naround this room, I can\u2019t help but wonder \u2018Is Ozempic right for me?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe comedian was referring to the current craze for semaglutide, a medication\ndesigned to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity that requires a doctor\u2019s\nprescription, and that many people (and not just celebrities) are using to\nbenefit from its famed side effect: loss of appetite and subsequent speed-\nslimming. Media coverage of the evening\u2019s red carpet splashed the subject\nacross a variety of publications: \u201cWhich of Oscars 2024 stars may or may not\nhave used Ozempic to cut weight for Hollywood\u2019s biggest night,\u201d read a\nheadline in The New York Post, which concluded that America Ferrera and\nBrendan Fraser may have used the drug. The Financial Times wrote about the\ndangers of \u201cliving in an Ozempic world.\u201d It was the subject of much discussion\non social media, with endless users posting about prescription slim-downs.\n\u201cOzempic brought a different dimension to the Oscars red carpet this year,\u201d\nclaimed The Sydney Morning Herald. Paris Match also devoted space to the\nstars\u2019 \u201cpilule magique.\u201d \u201cForget Chanel, Dior or Prada: This year, the most\nprominent designers on the red carpet are Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, whose\ninjectable weight-loss drugs are the new couture,\u201d announced famed newsletter\non Hollywood\u2019s cultural impact, The Ankler.\n\nDays before the awards ceremony, Eli Lilly, which currently manufactures two\nmedications that compete with Ozempic \u2014 Zepbound for obesity and Mounjaro for\ndiabetes \u2014 premiered a commercial that complicates the rapid weight-loss\nnarrative: \u201cSome people have been using medicine never meant for them. For the\nsmaller dress or tux, for a big night, for vanity. But that\u2019s not the point.\nPeople whose health is affected by obesity are the reason we work on these\nmedications. It matters who gets them.\u201d\n\nHollywood has clearly gone in on the express ass option, and to obtain it, as\nper the warning of Deneuve, it has run into a danger of which the rest of the\nworld was already aware: when we slim down the body too fast, we lose youthful\nelasticity in the face. Ozempic has made a splash on red carpets, but in\nreality, it is a global phenomenon \u2014 and business is booming. Sales numbers\nconfirm that Novo Nordisk\u2019s operating profits grew by 58% since 2017, the year\nthat it introduced Ozempic. Those figures are growing in part thanks to people\nwithout a history of diabetes, and in particular, a younger demographic.\nAccording to Komodo Health, a company that tracks data related to medical\ntreatment for 330 million U.S. patients, among people without diabetes who\nhave been prescribed Ozempic or Mounjaro, nearly 40% are between the ages of\n25 and 44.\n\nAs Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical creator of Ozempic, would have it, the\ndrug is \u201can injectable solution in a pre-filled pen.\u201d Its active ingredient is\nsemaglutide and \u201cit helps your body to reduce its blood sugar levels when\nthose levels are overly elevated, and it can help to prevent cardiac illness.\nOzempic is used to treat adults (from 18 years of age) with type 2 diabetes,\nwhen diet and exercise are not enough.\u201d\n\nFor diabetics, the drug reduces blood sugar levels. But it also impacts\nappetite, which means that when you start injecting it, the pounds begin to\ndrop off. That\u2019s why many people who are not necessarily diabetic or obese are\nusing it to slim down. In Spain, Social Security pays for the medicine when it\nis prescribed by a doctor in certain cases at a price of four doses for $4.59,\nthough many opt for private healthcare, despite its higher price point: $141\nfor the same number of doses.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just changing many individual\u2019s figures, but also their face, the\nway that we perceive beauty and the future of aesthetic medicine.\n\nOzempic on sale in a U.S. pharmacy. Mario Tama (Getty Images)\n\n### Sag and flab of the Ozempic face\n\nThe most common motivator for people who use semaglutide for aesthetic reasons\nis loss of appetite: Ozempic gives the feeling of being forever full, so that\nyou can say goodbye to snacking, and be satisfied with smaller portions of\nfood. Soon, though, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation can appear.\nAfter a few months, the \u201cOzempic face\u201d may show up in the form of prematurely\naged skin.\n\nIn a 2024 article about plastic surgery trends, Allure analyzes how the\n\u201cOzempic face\u201d is changing the kinds of aesthetic surgeries that patients are\nseeking out, and the ways in which doctors provide them. It says that many\npatients who have never undergone a facelift are seriously considering them,\nand that 20-somethings are asking for procedures that were designed for people\nover 50 due to flaccidity, sagging and loss of facial volume.\n\nWe spoke with five doctors about how Ozempic is changing faces, and the way\nthat we approach beauty.\n\nIn reality, Ozempic has just put a new name on the pre-existing practice of\nsudden weight loss. \u201cIt\u2019s a term that has been used in various articles to\nrefer to the facial skeletization that can be generated after loss of\nsignificant weight, from at least 17 to 22 pounds,\u201d explains aesthetic doctor\nMar Mira, who is the co-director of Madrid\u2019s Cl\u00ednica Mira+Cueto. According to\nMira, our face contains different structures, among which are deep and\nsuperficial fat compartments, which decrease with any kind of overall weight\nloss, not just drug-assisted slimdowns. \u201cIt is always more evident in thin\nfaces that have seen significant weight loss, since in overweight or obese\npatients, weight loss does not usually result in significant facial\nskeletonization. However, shadows underneath the cheeks may be accentuated by\nreabsorption of fat compartments, and facial flaccidity can become more\npronounced around the jowls and jaw line due to the loss of temporal and\npreauricular fat compartments, which are usually the first to be reabsorbed\nduring the aging process.\u201d The doctor says that patients who come to her\noffice with these concerns say that their appearance \u201cstarts to look tired, or\nthat sagging has become accentuated.\u201d\n\n### \u201cThe problem is not losing weight: it\u2019s doing it all at once\u201d\n\nAs Dr. Celia Gonzalo, a physician specializing in endocrinology and nutrition\nat Neolife Medical Group, explains to EL PA\u00cdS, \u201csudden and significant\ndecrease in facial fat can accentuate expression lines, cheekbones and also\ncause sagging in the cheek area. In short, for some people it can result in an\nolder-looking appearance.\u201d\n\n\u201cLoss of facial volume can be one of the signs of aging given that, as we get\nolder, we have less capacity for cellular regeneration, the musculoskeletal\nsystem changes, muscle mass and bone density decreases, as does collagen and\nelastin production, which leads to changes in our skin, like a loss of\nsmoothness and ability to hold up internal tissues as well as the appearance\nof wrinkles,\u201d says Dr. Gema P\u00e9rez Sevilla, a maxillofacial surgeon and expert\nin facial aesthetic medicine, who has a clinic in Madrid. \u201cMajor weight loss\naffects the whole body, including the face, and can definitely impact volume\nin the jowls and cheeks, among other places.\u201d\n\nThis is what Deneuve meant when she said one had to choose: when we lose a lot\nof volume in the body, our face can follow suit, aging our appearance.\n\u201cIndeed, with marked volumetric deficits, we go from a healthy, youthful-\nlooking face to a skeletonized face. In a skeletonized face, facial fat (which\nforms the face\u2019s cushioning) atrophies and bony ridges are accentuated. This\nconveys the appearance of fatigue through the sinking of the cheek at the\nanterior level, and can sometimes convey sadness. Temples are sunken, and\nflaccidity can progress, rotating facial structures and leading to a greater\ndegree of sagging. All this makes us look older and can impact our\nappearance,\u201d says Mira.\n\n\u201cLosing weight quickly and at an advanced age makes it so that the dermis\ncannot recover from new physical conditions. It is very important to lose fat\nhealthily and accompany the process with a healthy diet and exercise, always\nunder the supervision of a health professional,\u201d says Dr. Irene Cruz, a\nsurgical doctor who specializes in advanced aesthetic medicine and nutrition,\nand who is a member of the medical team at the Instituto De Benito, which has\nlocations in Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nFluctuations in weight are a recurring subject for many aesthetic medicine\npatients who are looking to refresh their appearance. \u201cLoss of volume means\nless support and subsequently, adjacent structures can sag more intensely. All\nthis leads to accelerated aging due to the folds and wrinkles that appear, and\na loss of luminosity in the face. In search of solutions to this problem,\nyoung people who are seeing these factors at an earlier age, who would have\nnormally sought us out 10 or 15 years later, do seek treatment from us,\u201d says\nDr. Mois\u00e9s Amselem, an aesthetic physician who specializes in facial\nrejuvenation at his clinic in Madrid.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### Aging researcher Coleen Murphy: \u2018All the doctors in the longevity field\nare taking metformin\u2019\n\nDaniel Mediavilla\n\n### Life after Ozempic\n\nEnrique Alpa\u00f1\u00e9s\n\n### Archived In\n\n  * Ozempic\n  * Hollywood\n  * Novo Nordisk\n  * Eli Lilly\n\nAdheres to\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact\nventacontenidos@prisamedia.com\n\nSponsored Content\n\nCheckfox\n\nBundesregierung will Solarausbau-Turbo: Deshalb m\u00fcssen Hausbesitzer schnell\nseinCheckfox|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nKein Scherz: So wenig kosten Treppenlifte 2024 wirklichTreppenlift-Vergleich|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nForge Of Empires\n\nWenn du \u00fcber 45 Jahre alt bist, wirst du dieses Strategiespiel 2024\nliebenForge Of Empires|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nAnd Also...\n\nAt least three shot when gunfire erupts at Philadelphia Eid event, police\nsayEl Pa\u00eds\n\nAS\n\nWatch: This is what the total solar eclipse looked like from spaceAS\n\nAS\n\nVideo: This is what a total eclipse looks like from a planeAS\n\n_\n\n### newsletter\n\nSign up to EL PA\u00cdS in English Edition bulletin\n\nAp\u00fantate\n\n### Most viewed\n\n  1.
