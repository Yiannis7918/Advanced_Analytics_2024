Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Valve's unusual corporate structure causes its problems, report suggests\n\nNews\n\nBy Jody Macgregor\n\npublished 27 January 2023\n\nEmployees interviewed by People Make Games blame Valve's lack of diversity and\npoor record shipping games on its flat structure.\n\nIt's well-known that Valve doesn't work like other game studios. Valve's flat\ncorporate structure means that, as its own New Employee Handbook reads, \"we\ndon\u2019t have any management, and nobody 'reports to' anybody else. We do have a\nfounder/president, but even he isn't your manager.\" The symbol of this freedom\nis the office's wheeled desks, which allow employees to form ad hoc teams by\nmoving together when someone\u2014anyone\u2014proposes a project that interests others,\nthen wheeling away once they decide to move on.\n\nIt sounds like a wonderful place to work, free from hierarchy and bureaucracy.\nHowever, according to a new video by People Make Games (a channel dedicated to\ninvestigative game journalism created by Chris Bratt and Anni Sayers), Valve\nemployees, both former and current, say it's resulted in a workplace two of\nthem compared to The Lord of The Flies.\n\nPart of the issue is the fact Valve uses stack ranking, an employee evaluation\ntechnique that a Blizzard employee was recently fired for protesting against.\nEvery year, Valve's staff judge each other through a series of meetings that\nresult in an overall ranking of every employee, and that ranking determines\nwho receives higher salaries in the next year. With no managers to communicate\nexactly how the judgements should be made, or how the resulting pay changes\nwill be decided\u2014presumably by the board of directors, which Valve still\nhas\u2014the effects on employee behavior seem quite noticeable.\n\n\"One of the most interesting ways you could see it seeping in was when people\nspecifically did riskier projects near the beginning of the year,\" a former\nValve employee told People Make Games. \"And then they'd go back to the more\nwell-known ones as it gets closer to review time because recency bias would\nmake people focus on that stuff.\"\n\nLatest Videos from pcgamer\n\nAnother effect was to reinforce Valve's lack of diversity. More than one\ninterviewee highlighted that, even compared to the rest of the videogame\nindustry, Valve is an extremely white and male company. While at other studios\na diverse-hiring initiative would come from management, at Valve it had to\ncome from the employees themselves. As an interviewee said, \"Valve's structure\nis what makes it difficult to gain momentum on anything where the value-add\nisn't immediately obvious to certain people though, and that certainly\nincludes any project where the word 'diversity' is mentioned.\"\n\nEven well-intentioned employers have an unconscious bias toward hiring people\nlike themselves, and a study of symphony orchestras that switched to blind\nauditions showed that simply removing the jury's knowledge of each musician's\nsex dramatically increased the number of women who were hired. Valve's a\ncompany founded by two white men in an industry that's already biased toward\nthem. Lacking anyone to push for changes to its hiring methods, while the rest\nof the games industry has slowly become more diverse Valve has seemingly gone\nthe opposite way.\n\n\"It feels like they've passed a critical mark,\" said an ex-employee. \"It used\nto be that there were maybe 10 or 15% women in the development teams so nobody\nwas usually the only woman in the room. But definitely now I think they've\ndipped below that point.\"\n\n## PC Gamer Newsletter\n\nSign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked\nby the editors.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nAnother occasion when Valve's flat structure seems to have affected decision-\nmaking was its response to indie developers pulling their games from Steam as\na criticism of Valve's silence on Black Lives Matter. Though Bratt mentions\n\"several employees I've spoken to blame Valve's leadership outright for that\ndecision,\" more of them were of the opinion it was a lack of leadership that\nprevented \"months of discussion\" from resulting in a statement and a plan for\nhow to release it that satisfied everyone.\n\n(Image credit: Valve Press)\n\nIn the end Valve didn't release any statement, instead sponsoring two events\nincluding the Game Devs of Color Expo and, an interviewee who is currently\nemployed at Valve said, \"Ultimately the thing that was landed on was that\nValve would give every employee $10,000 to do with whatever philanthropic\ndesire they have.\"\n\nOne decision was apparently decided at the top, and that's Valve's policy of\nno longer policing what's on Steam. An ex-employee explained, \"Something that\nGabe [Newell] would like to say is that if we were a video store he wouldn't\nwant to carry The Sopranos if it was up to his personal taste, but he\nrecognizes that that's an extremely successful and popular television show.\nAnd so even though he felt like it had no societal value it's not something\nthat should be banned. We would argue that there's a difference between us\nthinking something has little societal value and us thinking it has negative\nsocietal value.\"\n\nIgnoring Newell's unpopular take on The Sopranos, it seems like this was one\noccasion when the company's remaining founder had the last word. \"I disagreed\nwith his free speech absolutist stance,\" an interview subject said, \"but also\nthat our team was railroaded into adopting the stance as well. It really left\na sour taste in my mouth.\"\n\nWhen Valve's staff aren't being railroaded, when they're wheeling their desks\naround free and easy, it's easy to wonder what they're actually doing. There\nmust be a lot of desks clustered around the ongoing Steam Deck project, of\ncourse, but it's a running joke that Valve doesn't make many games. Its last\nmajor release was Half-Life: Alyx, not counting Aperture Desk Job, the tech\ndemo for the Steam Deck.\n\n(Image credit: Valve)\n\n\"I'm told that Valve would almost certainly have shipped more games, not\nnecessarily better ones but definitely more, had it adopted a traditional\ncompany structure that doesn't allow employees to walk or roll away from\nprojects as easily,\" Bratt says. \"But ultimately Steam's success has meant\nValve's income has not been dependent on the next game it ships in a very long\ntime.\"\n\nWhich is why Valve's unlikely to change any time soon. Difficult or thankless\ntasks seem to be left to whoever wants to earn brownie points by tackling\nthem\u2014one of the video's most surprising revelations is that firings are\nhandled by whoever volunteers to do them\u2014and tackling problems like the\nunmoderated hate speech that fills Steam's forums aren't the kind of fun\nproject anyone's likely to wheel a desk around for. Steam continues earning\nfistfuls regardless, and there's no motivation for Valve's corporate culture\nto change.\n\nPeople Make Games' video report is over 45 minutes long and covers a lot more\nground than this. Despite what Valve stans will say it's not a \"hit piece,\"\nand is well worth the time it takes to watch if you're at all interested in\nwhat goes on behind the scenes at one of the most influential companies in PC\ngaming. Their video on how Roblox is exploiting young game developers is\nanother worthwhile watch.\n\nJody Macgregor\n\nWeekend/AU Editor\n\nJody's first computer was a Commodore 64, so he remembers having to use a code\nwheel to play Pool of Radiance. A former music journalist who interviewed\neveryone from Giorgio Moroder to Trent Reznor, Jody also co-hosted Australia's\nfirst radio show about videogames, Zed Games. He's written for Rock Paper\nShotgun, The Big Issue, GamesRadar, Zam, Glixel, Five Out of Ten Magazine, and\nPlayboy.com, whose cheques with the bunny logo made for fun conversations at\nthe bank. Jody's first article for PC Gamer was about the audio of Alien\nIsolation, published in 2015, and since then he's written about why Silent\nHill belongs on PC, why Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is the best fantasy\nshopkeeper tycoon game, and how weird Lost Ark can get. Jody edited PC Gamer\nIndie from 2017 to 2018, and he eventually lived up to his promise to play\nevery Warhammer videogame.\n\nMore about platforms\n\nYellow Taxi Goes Vroom delivers imaginative 3D platforming without a jump\nbutton\n\nDuring a deposition his lawyer tried to keep confidential, Elon Musk says\n'people are attacked all the time' on social media, but it rarely has 'a\nmeaningful negative impact on their life'\n\nLatest\n\nTaiwanese chipmaking bounces back after last week's 7.4 magnitude earthquake\n\nSee more latest \u25ba\n\nSee comments\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nDinolords is basically Age of Empires with dinosaurs, and honestly what more\ncould you want from a strategy game than that?\n\nBy Robin Valentine10 April 2024\n\nVertical city builder Laysara: Summit Kingdom just surprise launched on Steam\n\nBy Mollie Taylor10 April 2024\n\nDarkest Dungeon 2 is getting a free new game mode later this year that will\nfeature 'some of the permanence and roster management' of the original game\n\nBy Andy Chalk10 April 2024\n\nHunt down a crazed sniper in a major new content update for our favorite\nvoxel-based Deus Ex-like detective sim\n\nBy Andy Chalk10 April 2024\n\nI respect a bloody arcade shooter with the courage to have a name as blunt as\n'Kill Knight'\n\nBy Tyler Colp10 April 2024\n\nSlay the Spire 2 releases in 2025: 'The Spire isn't what it used to be'\n\nBy Tyler Wilde10 April 2024\n\nElon Musk warns city-sized power footprints will limit future AI development\n\nBy Jeremy Laird10 April 2024\n\nOne of the most strange and cruel survival sandboxes I've played has sold 2.3\nmillion copies\n\nBy Joshua Wolens10 April 2024\n\nI can't make it 10 minutes in this free browser-based New York Times Sim\nwithout getting fired for commie agitprop\n\nBy Joshua Wolens10 April 2024\n\nStar Wars Outlaws' $110 and $130 editions prompt a collective sigh from\npotential players tired of season passes and ill-advised early access periods\n\nBy Harvey Randall10 April 2024\n\nYou'll soon be able to watch Commander Riker play D&D alongside other Star\nTrek actors, and it's all for charity\n\nBy Elie Gould10 April 2024\n\nLoad Comments\n\n  1. 1\n\nBest ultrawide monitor for gaming in 2024: the expansive panels I recommend\nfor PC gamers\n\n  2. 2\n\nBest wireless gaming keyboard in 2024\n\n  3. 3\n\nBest gaming laptops in 2024: I've had my pick of portable powerhouses and\nthese are the best\n\n  4. 4\n\nBest gaming chairs in 2024: the seats I'd suggest for any gamer\n\n  5. 5\n\nBest graphics cards in 2024: the GPUs I recommend for every budget\n\n  1. 1\n\nBroken Roads review: A cerebral narrative adventure trapped in an unsatisfying\nRPG\n\n  2. 2\n\nMajority D80 Active Bluetooth Speakers review\n\n  3. 3\n\nThermaltake TGM-V32CQ gaming monitor review\n\n  4. 4\n\nRazer Blade 14 (2024) review\n\n  5. 5\n\nXreal Air 2 and Beam review\n\nPC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading\ndigital publisher.
