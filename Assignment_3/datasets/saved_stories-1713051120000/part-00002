Questions get answered and\ndecisions are made in pings, messages, comments on to-dos, and everywhere in\nbetween. That means sometimes similar things are discussed in different\nplaces.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be helpful if related conversations were automatically connected\nfor easy reference? We think so.\n\nThat\u2019s why today we\u2019re introducing References.\n\nNow in Basecamp, linking to a message, to-do, card, event, document, or file\nautomatically creates a Reference, instantly tying related things together.\nYou can see where else something was discussed, so you have the full context\nno matter where the conversation happened.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say someone pitches an idea for a new approach to your\ncompany meet-ups. Later, after the meet-up is over, someone else posts about\nhow well it went and references the original message. Basecamp will\nautomatically add a Reference, so you can follow the thread from the idea to\nthe result.\n\nOr, maybe you link to a to-do in your daily check-in. When someone visits the\nto-do, they\u2019ll see that it was also referenced in your check-in, along with\nanywhere else it was mentioned.\n\nReferences work within a project, across projects, and in chat and pings, too.\nPlus, it\u2019s all automatic.\n\nYou'll find References in a separate tab alongside comments. Of course, you\nonly see References from projects and conversations that you can access.\n\nBasecamp\u2019s always been a library of your company's knowledge. But now the\nlibrary is linked up and cross-referenced wherever one thing is mentioned\nsomewhere else. It\u2019s like a living bibliography.\n\nReferences are live in your account. We're also backfilling References since\nthe start of the year to help you get going.\n\nWatch this short video to see References in action.\n\nWe've been using References for a few weeks at 37signals and it's been\ninvaluable. We hope you find them as useful as we have.\n\n## Email\u2019s new heyday\n\nEmail sucked for years. Not anymore \u2014 we fixed it. HEY\u2019s fresh approach\ntransforms email into something you want to use, not something you\u2019re forced\nto deal with.\n\nTry HEY free\n\n## Tried Basecamp lately?\n\nUsed an earlier version, but moved on? Heard of it, but never signed up?\nToday\u2019s Basecamp will surprise you! It\u2019s all-new, entirely modern, and unlike\nanything else.\n\nTry Basecamp free\n\nKimberly Rhodes\n\nNext\n\nNext\n\n## New in Basecamp: Better Bookmarks\n\n\u00a9 1999 \u2013 2023 37signals\n\n", "frontpage": false}
