Its a way to build a\ntribe and build a position in that tribe. Both, humor and human stories, are\nmost effective in engaging audience and retaining them.\n\n##\n\nPersonal Example\n\nWe tried building a brand by publishing stories on finances and women. We\ninterviewed Indian women and asked them interesting questions to understand\ntheir financial journey, their key take aways and ascertain their financial\nchoices. The interviews got us attention on Instagram, where we used paid\nroute to build an audience. Instagram stories that we published were pictorial\nand artistic summary about gritty financial stories about women. The topic of\nbringing women and finance together is hard one but still on Instagram, the\ncost per profile visit was as low as INR 5 and CPM was INR 9.16. The\nstatistics state that CPM varies from INR 8 to INR 12 for Indian audience [1]\nand ours was a hard audience to target.\n\nOur key learnings there were that you always need to give audience a feeling\nthat interacting with your post left them with a positive feeling that time\nwas well spent, either in form of learning or entertainment or both. Also,\nideally the color palette of the post as well as the language should appeal to\nthe target audience.\n\n##\n\nTracking customer engagement in Business presentations\n\nDid you know that laughs per minute could be used to track the the quality of\nbusiness presentation and audience engagement ?. Dharmesh Shah, CTO of\nHubSpot, speaks on how he optimizes his business presentations with live\naudience for laughs per minute as an effective strategy to give engaging\npresentations [4].\n\nAll content marketers have repeatedly leveraged humor and stories to gain\naudience attention, focus on retention and build a brand story. Zomato is an\nexample of a company that does it well.\n\n##\n\nThings to Remember\n\nLot of factors influence people to follow your content. Following are the some\naspects that need to be considered :\n\n  1. Create compelling content\n\n  2. Change how people feel in the moment.\n\n  3. Give people a story to tell in house.\n\nThanks for reading Build Startup In Public ! Subscribe for free to receive new\nposts and support my work.\n\n##\n\nReferences\n\n  1.
