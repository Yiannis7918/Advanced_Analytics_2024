They had a great interface and promising product. I never\npromoted them, aside from a brief mention in the eBooks, because the service\nwas too new. I had learned my own lesson from adopting CTemplar before it had\nmatured, and I did not want to invest my digital life into Skiff until I could\nsee how things developed. Recently, Skiff announced they had been sold to a\ndocuments workspace provider called Notion, and that all Skiff email addresses\nwould be terminated in six months.\n\nFortunately, I had never used my test Skiff accounts for any communication or\naccount creation. However, many people in this community adopted Skiff heavily\nand are now concerned about the inability to access these accounts in the near\nfuture. I want to present some ideas about email adoption, much of which I\nhave already published in previous books, to serve as a reminder for personal\nemail policy.\n\nPassword Manager: This is not just to generate and store passwords. You should\nalso store any email address used within a service. When I place a username\nand password within my password manager, I always record any current or\nprevious email addresses which I provided during signup, or changed after\ncreation. This way, I can always search an email address or email domain to\nidentify any accounts which could be at risk. When CTemplar shut down, I was\nable to quickly see the five accounts which possessed a CTemplar email\naddress; sign into them and change the address; then not worry once CTemplar\nshut their doors.\n\nDomains: I have always preached using your own domains for all vital email.\nSure, we all have burners with various providers for all of the junk, but I\nwould never use a Proton Mail, Tuta, or Fastmail domain for anything which is\nimportant to me, such as a financial institution or work communications. ANY\nservice could shut down or kick you out tomorrow. When you use your own\ndomain, you can easily forward it to another service within an hour.\n\nRedundancy: If Andy gets tired of my weekly emails asking for a new feature at\nProton Mail and suspends my account, I can forward my domains to Tuta within a\nfew minutes to keep receiving email. If Hanna over at Tuta decides I am shady\nand suspends my account for review, I can switch those domains over to Proton\nMail (Don't get any ideas you two). I maintain a paid package through Proton\nMail, Tuta, and Fastmail at all times. I can store all of my domains at any of\nthem whenever needed. While I doubt any of them are going away any time soon,\nI have redundancy. Both Proton Mail and Tuta offer secure E2EE, and both have\nproven their intent at longevity in this space. While I originally focused on\nProton Mail due to high adoption within my circles, I now see many more Tuta\naddresses in my inbox, which encourages me to communicate directly with those\npeople through one of my domains on Tuta.\n\nBusiness: I see a lot of Skiff bashing online. People say they are sellouts,\ntraitors, liars, etc. They are a business. Businesses pivot, become acquired,\nand sometimes go broke. We should never rely on a free service to provide us\nwith a lifetime of communications. This is why we should focus on reputable\nand established paid services, own our own domains through a third-party\nprovider which can be transferred when needed, and possess redundant services\nwhich are ready for our communications within an hour of bad news.\n\nSkiff is shutting down. We should get over it. We should move on. We should\nfind a better provider. If their closing forces us to adopt a better email\nprotocol, then we should be thanking them.\n\n#### Search\n\nAll blog posts, podcast episodes, and magazine issues are announced on this\nblog.
