In 2020, Apple\nintroduced \u201cPrivacy Labels\u201d aimed at disclosing how apps handle user data. And\nthat was just the beginning. Starting on April 10, the FCC is requiring\ninternet service providers to feature \u201cBroadband Facts\u201d labels detailing\npricing, speeds, and data caps. Meanwhile, some policymakers and industry\nanalysts have called for an \u201cAI Nutrition Facts\u201d label to clarify how\nartificial intelligence systems create content.\n\nThis rush to emulate the Nutrition Facts panel underscores the label\u2019s status\nas the go-to model for consumer transparency. Yet, the history of how it\nachieved that status reveals the power \u2014 and the limitations \u2014 of using such\nlabels as a regulatory tool. They can inform consumers, but they may also\nforestall more serious regulation that is necessary to adequately safeguard\nthe public interest.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) debated the\nproper way to safeguard consumers from misinformation and fearmongering in\nhealth food markets. Initially, officials resisted nutrition labeling on food,\nseeing it as unnecessary \u201cquackery\u201d or the purview of medical specialists\ntreating the ill.\n\nBut increasingly, the FDA had to weigh the growing legitimate medical interest\nin using diet as a preventative solution to public health, as well as the rise\nof a new self-improvement culture that made Americans more health conscious.\nFDA officials were also cognizant of declining public trust in the\ngovernment\u2019s ability to make decisions for consumers about their private lives\nafter years of scandals. This shifted officials\u2019 thinking and they began to\naccept that Americans had the right \u2014 and perhaps even the need \u2014 to seek out\nhealth information for food. They saw informative labels as empowering\nconsumers to make choices for themselves, based on their own lifestyle,\nwithout FDA paternalism.\n\nThis new approach led to the 1973 introduction of a \u201cNutrition Information\u201d\npanel to incentivize the food industry to make healthier packaged options.\nAdding the label was only voluntary, but if companies wanted to actively\npromote a heath claim or a food\u2019s nutrients they had to include it to balance\nout their promotional statements.\n\nRead More: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Asks Congress to Regulate AI\n\nWhile garnering some media fanfare, the nutrition information panel\u2019s bland\ndesign lacked visual impact. If anything, it arguably did more harm than good,\nbecause it cleared the path for food companies to hype their products with\ndubious claims about health benefits. They focused on nutrition, while\nobscuring other information that might be vital for consumers to make educated\ndecisions, like where a food came from or whether it was processed.\n\nThis trend intensified throughout the 1970s and 1980s as food companies buried\nconsumers in hard to decipher nutrition information. By 1989, U. S. Secretary\nof Health and Human Services Louis W. Sullivan was forced to admit that\n\u201cconsumers need to be linguists, scientists, and mind readers to understand\nmany of the labels they see.\u201d\n\nThe confusing labels prompted growing calls for the FDA to update nutrition\nlabeling rules. In 1990, Congress passed the Nutrition Labeling and Education\nAct, which finally mandated that the FDA design a uniform nutrition label for\nall packaged foods. Over three years, the agency conducted extensive consumer\nresearch and stakeholder outreach with both the food industry and relevant\nconsumer and health interest groups.\n\nUnlike in 1973, this time, officials focused on the label\u2019s design as well.\nThey hired Greenfield Belser Ltd., a firm that specialized in legal branding\nheaded by graphic designer Burkey Belser. According to Belser, FDA\nCommissioner David Kessler asked for his firm\u2019s help out of fear that the new\nlabel wouldn\u2019t \u201clook any different\u201d and no one would \u201cknow we\u2019ve even done\nanything.\u201d\n\nBelser, working with colleagues and policy experts, began to reformat the\nlayout and visual elements of the label giving form to its now-iconic design.\nThey introduced indented subgroups and hairlines for readability. They used\nHelvetica font because it was widely available, but also because it was easy\nto read. Most importantly, they gave the panel a boldfaced title, \u201cNutrition\nFacts,\u201d as well as black and white text, and they put a one-point rule around\nthe label. All of these moves aimed at clearly identifying the label as a\ndistinct element of the food packaging.\n\nIn an interview, Belser argued that the black box around the label signaled\n\u201cmanufacturers could not encroach on public property.\u201d The boldface title\nhelped transform Nutrition Facts into a \u201cgovernment brand.\u201d Indeed, only a few\nyears later the FDA hired Belser to \u201cextend the brand\u201d and create a similar\n\u201cDrug Facts\u201d label for drug packaging.\n\nThe FDA launched a multi-million dollar PR blitz to introduce the nutrition\nlabel. It included TV ads featuring celebrities \u2014 like baseball star Roger\nClemens and children\u2019s favorite animated monkey, Curious George \u2014 educational\nmaterials distributed nationwide to schools and doctor\u2019s offices, and\nappearances on TV talk shows by the FDA's leadership. They touted the label\u2019s\nability to help Americans make healthier choices, live longer and better\nlives, and thereby lower health-care costs.\n\nThe label proved to be an immediate hit with consumers and critics alike. By\n1996, design critic Massimo Vignelli was celebrating it as a triumph of\nsocially responsible \u201cinformation architecture\u201d that perfectly married form\nand function. Its clean layout of objective information contrasted with the\nostentation and flash of colorful, biased food advertising.\n\nThe label seemed to be a perfect solution. It enabled policymakers to nudge\nconsumers and businesses toward achieving goals instead of enacting what legal\nscholar Cass Sunstein \u2014 a fan of this new approach \u2014 labeled rigid \u201ccommand\nand control\u201d measures. The public and media lauded its simplicity and clarity,\nand food makers scrambled to reformulate products to improve nutrient\nprofiles.\n\nYet over the last 30 years, America\u2019s public health crisis has only deepened\nas obesity, heart disease, and other diet-linked illnesses have continued\nrising unchecked. While well-intentioned, the Nutrition Facts label proved no\npanacea.\n\nOne issue was a resurgence of commercial messaging that distorted nutrition\nfacts through clever marketing. As the public education campaign tied to the\nnew label came to an end, promotional health claims from food companies about\nnutrition information filled the void, easily eclipsing public health\nmessages. The clearest example of this was front-of-package labeling\nmanufacturers and retailers developed to highlight specific nutrient facts for\na product, often taking them out of context to make a food look healthier than\nit was.\n\nRead More: How Nutrition Education for Doctors Is Evolving\n\nPlagued by common biases \u2014 most notably the tendency to keep purchasing the\nsame food product unaware that it has changed or become less healthy \u2014\nconsumers also struggled to interpret labels holistically to create a balanced\ndiet amid a sea of information. Moreover, framing dietary health as an\nindividualized \u201cchoice\u201d ignored deeper barriers to healthy eating like \u201cfood\ndeserts\u201d where getting fresh fruits and vegetables was impossible or the\nconstraints poverty placed on people\u2019s food choices. For all its design\nprowess, Nutrition Facts embraced an ideology of consumer empowerment ill-\nequipped to address systemic disadvantages.\n\nUltimately, the label\u2019s greatest impact may have been catalyzing food\ncompanies to reduce unhealthy nutrients, like saturated fats and sodium, and\nboost healthier ones, like fiber and protein, spurred by consumer scrutiny.\nBut this had little to do with the knowledge deficit the label was invented to\nsolve, and often manufacturers simply replaced one unhealthy ingredient with\nanother.\n\nThis mixed legacy offers lessons as policymakers now consider transparency\nfixes for technologies like AI, online privacy, and broadband.\n\nSimple design and accessible information disclosures have undeniable value and\npolitical appeal. They can catalyze industry accountability and create a\npressure to incorporate public values into marketplace options. However,\nlabels alone are not enough to solve complex social issues. Their\nindividualistic \u201cempowerment\u201d ethic ignores socioeconomic barriers to access.\nAnd their \u201cintuitive\u201d design often glosses over complex contextual nuances.\n\nMost critically, there is a real danger that informational disclosure risks\npreempting deeper, tougher regulations that might be warranted. As media\nscholar Michael Schudson has observed, \u201cit affords government the least\ninvasive action possible on some social problem.\u201d\n\nBut before choosing that option, policymakers need to assess whether such\nlabeling is capable of resolving core public concerns \u2014 from algorithmic bias\nto data commodification to affordable internet access. If not, stronger\nregulatory oversight may be required, with labeling playing an educational\nsupport role rather than being a standalone solution.\n\nArming consumers with education simply cannot substitute for asking whether\ncertain industry practices should be permitted in the first place. That\u2019s the\nlesson of our most iconic informational label.\n\nXaq Frohlich is associate professor of history of technology at Auburn\nUniversity and author of From Label to Table: Regulating Food in America in\nthe Information Age.\n\nMade by History takes readers beyond the headlines with articles written and\nedited by professional historians.
