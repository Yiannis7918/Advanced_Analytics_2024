He was a promising\ncriminology student at North Carolina State University and an aspiring Olympic\nathlete. He had many friends, a stable relationship and a loving family.\n\nHis death was one of 50,000 suicides registered in the US last year - the\nlargest number ever recorded. In second place: 2022, which saw 49,449\nsuicides.\n\nCrippled with grief, Tony and Katherine have created a \"memory wall\" to Ben in\ntheir front room. His university diploma, awarded posthumously, hangs at the\ntop.\n\n\"He was a good all-round person,\" Tony says. \"There's a huge hole in our\nsouls. A part of us is missing.\"\n\nKatherine and Tony Salas saw no warning signs\n\nBut why did Ben kill himself? That's the question the Salas family is\nstruggling to answer.\n\nBen's parents say their son briefly received treatment for mild depression in\n2020, but subsequently reassured them that he had fully recovered.\n\n\"There weren't any of the typical indicators that you would expect in a kid\nthat was continuing to struggle mentally. He wasn't withdrawn,\" says Tony.\n\nBen was close to his parents, speaking to them often. Tony called his son\nshortly before he died.\n\n\"He said 'I'm okay. I'm good.' And then a couple of hours after that he was\ngone.\"\n\nNorth Carolina State University has recently been sent reeling by a series of\nsuicides. In the previous academic year, seven students, including Ben, took\ntheir own lives. So far this academic year, there have been three suicides,\nincluding one at the end of January.\n\nThe high number of suicides has been very difficult on staff and students\nalike, says Assistant Vice-Chancellor Justine Hollingshead, who is based at NC\nState's sprawling campus in the centre of Raleigh, North Carolina. She says\nsuicide is a \"national epidemic\" in the United States that isn't limited to\njust college campuses.\n\n\"If we knew the reason, we would solve the problem. It's not something that\nwe're trying to avoid or not figure out. But there may be no warning signs:\nindividuals don't tell their family or friends, they don't reach out to\nresources and they make that decision. And we'll likely never know why.\"\n\nNC State has increased the number of counsellors and drop-in spaces, and\nintroduced a system called \"QPR: Question, Persuade, Refer\" so that students\ncan recognise the signs that friends or classmates are struggling and get them\nhelp.\n\nStaff are trained to refer students who habitually skip lectures or request\nextensions to deadlines - in case these, too, are signs that something isn't\nright.\n\n\"I feel like we're doing the very best we can in unimaginable circumstances,\"\nMs Hollingshead says.\n\n\"Last year it was a case of get through and survive, provide support and hope\nthat you can save a life.\"\n\nNC State is asking students to \"Question, Persuade, Refer\"\n\nRaleigh is known as \"the City of Oaks\" and NC State's red-brick university\nbuildings are nestled among them. The student union, known as Talley, is a\nmulti-storey beehive of cafes, study areas and shops.\n\n\"I was in the dorm of the first one that happened.\" says one student, Lorelai.\n\"I think a lot of kids our age have anxiety about the world. There are\nconstant things that aren't getting better, and life is expensive.\"\n\nBrody, a computer science student, says he's aware of the help available from\nemails the university sends out frequently.\n\n\"They're putting more of an emphasis on mental health problems,\" he says.\n\nOther universities, across many different states, are experiencing a similar\ntrend. And suicide is now the second-leading cause of death among Americans\nunder the age of 35, according to the Centers for Disease Control, America's\nhealth protection agency.\n\nThe Covid pandemic could be a contributing factor, says Dr Christine Crawford,\na psychiatrist and associate medical director at the National Alliance on\nMental Illness.\n\n\"It caused this significant hit on our young people in terms of acquiring the\nsocial skills and tools that they need,\" she says. \"They were at home, they\nwere disconnected from their peers and from the elements that are so critical\nfor healthy development in a young person.\"\n\nYoung people who spend a lot of time \"wrapped up\" in their gadgets are\nconstantly bombarded with images of war and polarising political messages,\nwhich can lead to anxiety and depression, according to Dr Crawford.\n\nIn December 2021, the US surgeon general issued a rare public health advisory\non the rising number of youth attempting suicide, singling out social media\nand the pandemic, which had \"exacerbated the unprecedented stresses young\npeople already faced\".\n\nCalls to 988, a national suicide helpline with more than 200 centres across\nthe US, increased by 100,000 per month in the last year alone.\n\nOne centre in the state of Maryland is currently expanding its staff from the\n150 operators who already work there.\n\nOperator Josue Melendez says many calls come from younger males, starting at\nage 15 and going up to 35 or 40, and university students.\n\n\"The stress of having to pay for [university], the economy as well, all that\ncan be stressful for one person to take in,\" he says.\n\nThe parents of Ben Salas have created a memory wall\n\nBack at the Salas family home, Katherine agrees young people are struggling\nwith financial pressures.\n\n\"Every safety net that past generations had has been taken away. I think that\na lot of young people feel very insecure about what their future holds for\nthem,\" she says.\n\nShe wears a badge pinned to her top featuring a picture of her son and the\nwords \"You Matter\".\n\n\"I wear it every day, over my heart, because that's where Ben is,\" she says,\nfighting back tears.\n\nThey want to raise awareness about \"something that he didn't have control over\n- depression\".\n\nMental illness is stigmatised in the US, they both say.\n\n\"We need more people to talk about it,\" says Tony. \"If it can happen to us,\nthen it can happen to somebody else.\"\n\nKatherine agrees: \"Don't settle for 'I'm OK.' An 'OK' may be an OK, but a lot\nof times it's not.\"\n\n  * If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story you can visit BBC Action Line.
