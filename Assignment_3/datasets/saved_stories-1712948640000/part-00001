Many report making sacrifices to cover their\nhousing costs.\n\n> \u201cHousing has become so financially burdensome in America that some families\n> can no longer afford other essentials, including food and medical care, and\n> have been forced to make major sacrifices, work overtime and ask others for\n> money so they can cover their monthly costs\u201d\n>\n> Post this\n\nThe most common sacrifice was taking no or fewer vacations. More than one-\nthird of homeowners and renters (34.5%) who struggle to afford housing\nindicated that they skipped vacations in the past year in order to afford\ntheir monthly costs.\n\nBut many people who struggle to afford housing made more serious sacrifices:\n22% skipped meals and 20.7% worked extra hours at their job. A similar share\n(20.6%) sold belongings.\n\nThese responses are based on a Redfin-commissioned survey conducted by\nQualtrics in February 2024. The nationally representative survey was fielded\nto roughly 3,000 U.S. homeowners and renters. Most of Redfin\u2019s report focuses\non the 1,494 respondents who indicated that they sometimes, regularly or\ngreatly struggle to afford regular rent or mortgage payments.\n\nMore than one of every six people (17.9%) who struggle to afford housing\nborrowed money from friends/family, and 17.6% dipped into their retirement\nsavings. Over one in seven (15.6%) delayed or skipped medical treatments.\n\n\u201cHousing has become so financially burdensome in America that some families\ncan no longer afford other essentials, including food and medical care, and\nhave been forced to make major sacrifices, work overtime and ask others for\nmoney so they can cover their monthly costs,\u201d said Redfin Economics Research\nLead Chen Zhao. \u201cFortunately, the country\u2019s leaders are starting to pay\nattention, and homebuyers may get a reprieve in June if the Federal Reserve\ncuts interest rates, which would bring down the cost of getting a mortgage.\u201d\n\nMortgage payments are near their all-time high due to rising prices and\nelevated mortgage rates: The median U.S. home sale price is up about 5% from a\nyear ago, and mortgage rates are hovering around 7%, not far from the 23-year\nhigh of roughly 8% hit in October. The typical household earns roughly $30,000\nless than it needs to afford the median-priced home, and rents are on the rise\nagain.\n\n14% of Millennials Dipped Into Retirement Savings to Afford Housing Payments\n\nNearly one of every seven millennials (13.5%) who struggle to afford their\nhousing payments have dipped into retirement savings to cover their monthly\ncosts.\n\nMost millennials are not retired, but housing affordability has become so\nstrained that some are resorting to outside-the-box strategies to cover\nexpenses. Millennials are the largest adult generation, and many are aging\ninto their homebuying years at a time when home prices and mortgage rates are\nhigh.\n\nThe income needed to afford a starter home is up 8% from a year ago, prompting\nsome young buyers to use family money to cover their down payment.\n\nBaby boomers who struggle to afford housing were most likely to dip into\nretirement funds, with over one-quarter (27.5%) saying they did so to cover\nhousing expenses. That makes sense, as many baby boomers are already retired,\nand it\u2019s common for retirees to put their retirement savings toward housing.\n\nRoughly 1 in 6 (15.5%) Gen Xers who struggle to afford housing dipped into\nretirement savings to afford monthly housing costs. The share was lowest among\nGen Z respondents (6.5%), many of whom don\u2019t yet have retirement savings.\n\nThe IRS typically taxes people who make withdrawals from their retirement\naccounts before the age of 59.5, but makes an exception for qualified first-\ntime homebuyers, who are allowed to borrow up to $10,000 tax free.\n\nBroken down by race/ethnicity, white respondents who struggle to afford\nhousing were most likely (20.7%) to use retirement savings to cover housing\ncosts, followed by Asian/Pacific Islander respondents (14%), Hispanic/LatinX\nrespondents (13.6%) and Black respondents (12.6%).\n\nBlack Respondents Most Likely Work Extra Hours to Afford Housing; Gen Zers\nMost Likely to Sell Belongings\n\nWhile pressing pause on vacations was the most common sacrifice for\nrespondents as a whole, it wasn\u2019t the top answer choice for every demographic.\nPeople of color and younger generations often made more serious sacrifices.\n\nFor example, Black respondents who struggle to afford housing were most likely\nto say they worked extra hours (25.9%) to cover their monthly costs, while\nHispanic respondents were most likely to say that they sold belongings\n(28.2%). Skipping vacations was the most common answer among Asian/Pacific\nIslander respondents (43.8%) and white respondents (39.6%).\n\nBlack millennials are half as likely to own homes as white millennials,\naccording to a separate Redfin analysis, though the racial homeownership gap\nexists across every generation due to decades of racist policies and\ndiscrimination.\n\nWhen it came to age groups, skipping vacations was the top choice for baby\nboomers (42.8%), Gen Xers (36.8%) and millennials (31.3%) who struggle to\nafford housing. But for Gen Zers, the most common sacrifices were working\nextra hours, selling belongings and skipping meals, all of which clocked in at\nroughly 27%.\n\nWhite Respondents, Baby Boomers and Homeowners Most Likely to Afford Housing\nEasily\n\nOf the roughly 2,995 people who took the survey, half (50.1%) said they can\neasily afford their regular rent or mortgage payments, and half (49.9%) said\nthey sometimes, regularly or greatly struggle to do so.\n\nBut the results vary by demographic. For example, 54.5% of white respondents\nsaid they can easily afford their housing payments, compared with 37.8% of\nHispanic/LatinX respondents, 46.6% of Black respondents and 47.4% of\nAsian/Pacific Islander respondents.\n\nBaby boomers were most likely to say they easily afford housing payments\n(61.9%), followed by Gen Xers (48.7%), millennials (40.2%) and Gen Zers\n(26.9%).\n\nAnd homeowners (59.9%) were roughly twice as likely as renters (30.8%) to\nindicate that they easily afford their housing payments.\n\nTo view the full report, including charts and a detailed methodology, please\nvisit: https://www.redfin.com/news/homebuying-sacrifices-survey-2024\n\nAbout Redfin\n\nRedfin (www.redfin.com) is a technology-powered real estate company.
