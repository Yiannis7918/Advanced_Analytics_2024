It reads: \"This brave\nman, so filled with love for his country that he finds it difficult to die, is\ncalling out to his friends and about to die\".\n\nThe death poem is a genre of poetry that developed in the literary traditions\nof East Asian cultures\u2014most prominently in Japan as well as certain periods of\nChinese history and Joseon Korea. They tend to offer a reflection on\ndeath\u2014both in general and concerning the imminent death of the author\u2014that is\noften coupled with a meaningful observation on life. The practice of writing a\ndeath poem has its origins in Zen Buddhism. It is a concept or worldview\nderived from the Buddhist teaching of the three marks of existence (\u4e09\u6cd5\u5370,\nsanb\u014din), specifically that the material world is transient and impermanent\n(\u7121\u5e38, muj\u014d), that attachment to it causes suffering (\u82e6, ku), and ultimately all\nreality is an emptiness or absence of self-nature (\u7a7a, k\u016b). These poems became\nassociated with the literate, spiritual, and ruling segments of society, as\nthey were customarily composed by a poet, warrior, nobleman, or Buddhist monk.\n\nThe writing of a poem at the time of one's death and reflecting on the nature\nof death in an impermanent, transitory world is unique to East Asian culture.\nIt has close ties with Buddhism, and particularly the mystical Zen Buddhism\n(of Japan), Chan Buddhism (of China) and Seon Buddhism (of Korea). From its\ninception, Buddhism has stressed the importance of death because awareness of\ndeath is what prompted the Buddha to perceive the ultimate futility of worldly\nconcerns and pleasures. A death poem exemplifies both the \"eternal loneliness\"\nthat is found at the heart of Zen and the search for a new viewpoint, a new\nway of looking at life and things generally, or a version of enlightenment\n(satori in Japanese; wu in Chinese). According to comparative religion scholar\nJulia Ching, Japanese Buddhism \"is so closely associated with the memory of\nthe dead and the ancestral cult that the family shrines dedicated to the\nancestors, and still occupying a place of honor in homes, are popularly called\nthe Butsudan, literally 'the Buddhist altars'. It has been the custom in\nmodern Japan to have Shinto weddings, but to turn to Buddhism in times of\nbereavement and for funeral services\".^[1]\n\nThe writing of a death poem was limited to the society's literate class,\nruling class, samurai, and monks. It was introduced to Western audiences\nduring World War II when Japanese soldiers, emboldened by their culture's\nsamurai legacy, would write poems before suicidal missions or battles.^[2]\n\n## Chinese death poems[edit]\n\n### Yuan Chonghuan[edit]\n\nYuan Chonghuan (\u8881\u5d07\u7165, 1584\u20131630) was a politician and military general who\nserved under the Ming dynasty. He is best known for defending Liaodong from\nJurchen invaders during the Later Jin invasion of the Ming. Yuan met his end\nwhen he was arrested and executed by lingchi (\"slow slicing\") on the order of\nthe Chongzhen Emperor under false charges of treason, which were believed to\nhave been planted against him by the Jurchens. Before his execution, he\nproduced the following poem.^[3]\n\n> \u4e00\u751f\u4e8b\u696d\u7e3d\u6210\u7a7a \u534a\u4e16\u529f\u540d\u5728\u5922\u4e2d \u6b7b\u5f8c\u4e0d\u6101\u7121\u52c7\u5c07 \u5fe0\u9b42\u4f9d\u820a\u5b88\u907c\u6771\n>\n> A life's work totals to nothing Half of my career seems to be in dreams I do\n> not worry about lacking brave warriors after my death For my loyal spirit\n> will continue to guard Liaodong\n\n### Xia Wanchun[edit]\n\nXia Wanchun (\u590f\u5b8c\u6df3, 1631\u20131647) was a Ming dynasty poet and soldier.

He\nwas executed by Wang Shichong after trying to resign from his official\nposition under Wang and become a Buddhist monk.

His death poem is\nvisible in the upper right corner.\n\nThe poem's structure can be in one of many forms, including the two\ntraditional forms in Japanese literature: kanshi or waka.^[a] Sometimes they\nare written in the three-line, seventeen-syllable haiku form, although the\nmost common type of death poem (called a jisei \u8f9e\u4e16) is in the waka form called\nthe tanka (also called a jisei-ei \u8f9e\u4e16\u8a60) which consists of five lines totaling\n31 syllables (5-7-5-7-7)\u2014a form that constitutes over half of surviving death\npoems (Ogiu, 317\u2013318).\n\nPoetry has long been a core part of Japanese tradition. Death poems are\ntypically graceful, natural, and emotionally neutral, in accordance with the\nteachings of Buddhism and Shinto.^[7] Excepting the earliest works of this\ntradition, it has been considered inappropriate to mention death explicitly;\nrather, metaphorical references such as sunsets, autumn or falling cherry\nblossom suggest the transience of life.\n\nIt was an ancient custom in Japan for literate persons to compose a jisei on\ntheir deathbed. One of the earliest was recited by Prince \u014ctsu, executed in\n686. More examples of jisei are those of the famous haiku poet Bash\u014d, the\nJapanese Buddhist monk Ry\u014dkan, Edo Castle builder \u014cta D\u014dkan, the monk Gessh\u016b\nS\u014dko, and the woodblock master Tsukioka Yoshitoshi. The custom has continued\ninto modern Japan. Some people left their death poems in multiple forms:\nPrince \u014ctsu made both waka and kanshi, and Sen no Riky\u016b made both kanshi and\nky\u014dka.\n\n> \u6765\u6642\u306f\u7a7a\u624b\u3001\u53bb\u6642\u306f\u8d64\u811a\u3002\u4e00\u53bb\u4e00\u6765\u3001\u5358\u91cd\u4ea4\u6298^[8]\n>\n> Raiji wa karate kyoji wa sekkyaku ikkyoichirai tanjuu sekkou\n>\n> Empty-handed I entered the world Barefoot I leave it.

Before her death in childbirth in 1001, she wrote three waka to express\nher sorrow and love to her servant, Sei Sh\u014dnagon, and the emperor. Teishi said\nthat she would be entombed, rather than be cremated, so that she wrote that\nshe will not become dust or cloud. The first one was selected into the poem\ncollection Ogura Hyakunin Isshu.\n\nCherry blossoms at the Tokyo Imperial Palace\n\n> \u591c\u3082\u3059\u304c\u3089 \u5951\u308a\u3057\u4e8b\u3092 \u5fd8\u308c\u305a\u306f \u3053\u3072\u3080\u6d99\u306e \u8272\u305e\u3086\u304b\u3057\u304d \u77e5\u308b\u4eba\u3082 \u306a\u304d\u522b\u308c\u8def\u306b \u4eca\u306f\u3068\u3066 \u5fc3\u307c\u305d\u304f\u3082 \u6025\u304e\u305f\u3064\u304b\u306a \u70df\u3068\u3082 \u96f2\u3068\u3082\u306a\u3089\u306c \u8eab\u306a\u308c\u3069\u3082\n> \u8349\u8449\u306e\u9732\u3092 \u305d\u308c\u3068\u306a\u304c\u3081\u3088\n>\n> yo mosu gara / chigirishi koto o / wasurezu wa/ kohimu namida no/ irozo\n> yukashiki shiru hito mo/naki wakare chi ni / ima wa tote / kokoro bosoku mo\n> / isogi tasu kana kemuri tomo / kumo tomo naranu / mi nare domo / kusaba no\n> tsuyu wo / sore to nagame yo\n>\n> If you remember the promises between us, When you think of me after my\n> death.

In the message, General Kuribayashi apologized for failing to\nsuccessfully defend Iwo Jima against the overwhelming forces of the United\nStates military. At the same time, however, he expressed great pride in the\nheroism of his men, who, starving and thirsty, had been reduced to fighting\nwith rifle butts and fists. He closed the message with three traditional death\npoems in waka form.\n\n> \u56fd\u306e\u70ba \u91cd\u304d\u52aa\u3092 \u679c\u3057\u5f97\u3067 \u77e2\u5f3e\u5c3d\u304d\u679c\u3066 \u6563\u308b\u305e\u60b2\u3057\u304d \u4ec7\u8a0e\u305f\u3067 \u91ce\u8fba\u306b\u306f\u673d\u3061\u3058 \u543e\u306f\u53c8 \u4e03\u5ea6\u751f\u308c\u3066 \u77db\u3092\u57f7\u3089\u3080\u305e \u919c\u8349\u306e \u5cf6\u306b\u8513\u308b \u5176\u306e\u6642\u306e\n> \u7687\u56fd\u306e\u884c\u624b \u4e00\u9014\u306b\u601d\u3075\n>\n> Kuni no tame / omoki tsutome o / hatashi ede / yadama tsukihate / chiruzo\n> kanashiki Ada utade / nobe niwa kuchiji / warewa mata / shichido umarete /\n> hoko o toranzo Shikokusa no / shima ni habikoru / sono toki no / Mikuni no\n> yukute / ichizu ni omou\n>\n> Unable to complete this heavy task for our country Arrows and bullets all\n> spent, so sad we fall.

The Zen monk Tok\u014d (\u675c\u53e3;\n1710\u20131795) commented on the pretentiousness of some jisei in his own death\npoem:\n\n> \u8f9e\u4e16\u3068\u306f \u5373\u3061\u307e\u3088\u3072 \u305f\u309e\u6b7b\u306a\u3093\n>\n> Jisei to wa sunawachi mayoi tada shinan\n>\n> Death poems are mere delusion \u2013 death is death.^[14]^: 78\n\nThis poem by Moriya Sen'an (d. 1838) showed an expectation of an entertaining\nafterlife:\n\n> \u6211\u6b7b\u306a\u3070 \u9152\u5c4b\u306e\u74f6\u306e \u4e0b\u306b\u3044\u3051\u3088 \u3082\u3057\u3084\u96eb\u306e \u3082\u308a\u3084\u305b\u3093\u306a\u3093\n>\n> Ware shinaba sakaya no kame no shita ni ikeyo moshi ya shizuku no mori ya\n> sen nan\n>\n> Bury me when I die beneath a wine barrel in a tavern.

However, better-known examples are\nthose written or recited by famous historical figures facing death when they\nwere executed for loyalty to their former king or due to insidious plot. They\nare therefore impromptu verses, often declaring their loyalty or\nsteadfastness. The following are some examples that are still learned by\nschool children in Korea as models of loyalty. These examples are written in\nKorean sijo (three lines of 3-4-3-4 or its variation) or in Hanja five-\nsyllable format (5-5-5-5 for a total of 20 syllables) of ancient Chinese\npoetry (\u4e94\u8a00\u8a69).\n\n### Yi Gae[edit]\n\nYi Gae (\uc774\uac1c; 1417\u20131456) was one of \"six martyred ministers\" who were executed\nfor conspiring to assassinate King Sejo, who usurped the throne from his\nnephew Danjong. Sejo offered to pardon six ministers including Yi Gae and\nSeong Sam-mun if they would repent their crime and accept his legitimacy, but\nYi Gae and all others refused. He recited the following poem in his cell\nbefore execution on June 8, 1456. In the following sijo, \"Lord\" (\uc784 im)\nactually should read someone beloved or cherished, meaning King Danjong in\nthis instance.^[15]\n\n> \ubc29(\u623f) \uc548\uc5d0 \ud613\ub294 \ucd09(\u71ed) \ubd88 \ub20c\uacfc \uc774\ubcc4(\u96e2\u5225)\ud558\uc5ff\uad00\ub300 \uac83\uce20\ub85c \ub208\ubbc8 \ub514\uace0 \uc18d \ud0c0\ub294 \uc974 \ubaa8\ub974\ub294\uace0. \ub38c \ucd09(\u71ed) \ubd88 \ub0a0\uacfc \uac13\ud2b8\uc5ec \uc18d \ud0c0\ub294\n> \uc974 \ubaa8\ub85c\ub3c4\ub2e4.\n>\n> Oh, candlelight shining the room, with whom did you part?

His political enemies slandered Jo to be disloyal by writing \"Jo will\nbecome the king\" (\uc8fc\ucd08\uc704\uc655 \u8d70\u8096\u7232\u738b, ju cho wi wang) with honey on leaves so that\ncaterpillars left behind the same phrase as if in supernatural manifestation.\nKing Jungjong ordered his death by sending poison and abandoned Jo's reform\nmeasures. Jo, who had believed to the end that Jungjong would see his errors,\nwrote the following before drinking poison on December 20, 1519.^[17]\nRepetition of similar looking words is used to emphasize strong conviction in\nthis five-syllable poem.\n\n> \u611b\u541b\u5982\u611b\u7236 (\uc560\uad70\uc5ec\uc560\ubd80) -\uc784\uae08 \uc0ac\ub791\ud558\uae30\ub97c \uc544\ubc84\uc9c0 \uc0ac\ub791\ud558\ub4ef \ud558\uc600\uace0 \u6182\u570b\u5982\u6182\u5bb6 (\uc6b0\uad6d\uc5ec\uc6b0\uac00) -\ub098\ub77c \uac71\uc815\ud558\uae30\ub97c \uc9d1\uc548 \uadfc\uc2ec\ucc98\ub7fc \ud558\uc600\ub2e4\n> \u767d\u65e5\u81e8\u4e0b\u571f (\ubc31\uc77c\uc784\ud558\ud1a0) -\ubc1d\uc740 \ud574 \uc544\ub798 \uc138\uc0c1\uc744 \uad7d\uc5b4\ubcf4\uc0ac \u662d\u662d\u7167\u4e39\u8877 (\uc18c\uc18c\uc870\ub2e8\ucda9) -\ub0b4 \ub2e8\uc2ec\uacfc \ucda9\uc815 \ubc1d\ub514 \ubc1d\uac8c \ube44\ucdb0\uc8fc\uc18c\uc11c\n>\n> Loved my sovereign as own father Worried over country as own house The\n> bright sun looking down upon earth Shines ever so brightly on my red heart.\n\n### Jeong Mong-ju[edit]\n\nJeong Mong-ju (\uc815\ubabd\uc8fc; 1337\u20131392) was an influential high minister of the Goryeo\ndynasty when Yi Seong-gye overthrew it to establish the Joseon dynasty. When\nPrince Jeongan asked Jeong to support the new dynasty through a poem, Jeong\nanswered with a poem of his own reaffirming his loyalty to the falling Goryeo\ndynasty. Just as he suspected, he was assassinated the same night on April 4,\n1392. The Goryeo dynasty symbolically ended with Jeong's death and his death\npoem is the most famous in Korean history.\n\n> \u6b64\u8eab\u6b7b\u4e86\u6b7b\u4e86\u4e00\u767e\u756a\u66f4\u6b7b\u4e86 (\ucc28\uc2e0\uc0ac\ub8cc\uc0ac\ub8cc\uc77c\ubc31\ubc88\uac31\uc0ac\ub8cc) -\uc774\ubab8\uc774 \uc8fd\uace0 \uc8fd\uc5b4 \uc77c\ubc31 \ubc88 \uace0\uccd0 \uc8fd\uc5b4 \u767d\u9aa8\u7232\u5875\u571f\u9b42\u9b44\u6709\u4e5f\u7121 (\ubc31\uace8\uc704\uc9c4\ud1a0\ud63c\ubc31\uc720\ubb34\uc57c)\n> -\ubc31\uace8\uc774 \uc9c4\ud1a0\ub418\uc5b4 \ub10b\uc774\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc788\uace0 \uc5c6\uace0 \u5411\u4e3b\u4e00\u7247\u4e39\u5fc3\u5be7\u6709\u6539\u7406\u4e5f\u6b5f (\ud5a5\uc8fc\uc77c\ud3b8\ub2e8\uc2ec\uc720\uac1c\ub9ac\uc5ec) -\uc784 \ud5a5\ud55c \uc77c\ud3b8 \ub2e8\uc2ec\uc774\uc57c \uac00\uc2e4 \uc904\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\ub7b4.\n>\n> Should this body die and die again a hundred times over, White bones turning\n> to dust, with or without trace of soul, My steadfast heart toward Lord,\n> could it ever fade away?\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Elegy\n  * Epitaph\n  * Graveyard Poets\n  * Lament\n  * Last words\n  * Mi \u00faltimo adi\u00f3s\n  * Ry\u014dkan\n  * Suicide note\n  * Xie Lingyun\n  * Yuan Chonghuan\n  * Chinese Ch\u00e1n\n  * Japanese Zen\n  * Mono no aware\n  * Wabi-sabi\n  * Memento mori\n  * Swan song\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Kanshi\" is a Chinese-style poem written in Chinese characters by a Japanese poet; while waka, which literally means \"Japanese poem\", is written in lines alternating between 5 and 7 syllables\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Julia Ching, \"Buddhism: A Foreign Religion in China.
