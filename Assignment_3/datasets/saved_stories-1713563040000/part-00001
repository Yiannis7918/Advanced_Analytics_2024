But one of the main bottlenecks to faster\nproduction is the shortage of propellant and explosive powder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe European Commission is looking to help: Nearly half of the \u20ac500 million in\nEU subsidies under the Act in Support of Ammunition Production (ASAP) were\nallocated to projects aimed at increasing powder production.\n\nPropellant powder is made out of nitrocellulose, among other things, which\nitself is made from cotton fibers that mostly come from China.\n\nSaab is one of Europe's main weapons manufacturers, producing ground combat\nweapons, submarines and missiles. Alongside France's Dassault Aviation, the\nSwedish company is also the only European manufacturer able to make a fighter\njet alone \u2014 the JAS 39 Gripen.\n\nEurope's defense companies have been under pressure to produce more weapons and ammunition, faster \u2014 both to support Kyiv and to bolster domestic defense. | Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nJohansson's comments come as Brussels is also pushing an economic security\nagenda to reduce dependencies on Beijing \u2014 in a bid to \"de-risk\" the bloc's\nsupply chains.\n\nWhen it comes to arms, the stakes of relying on Chinese raw material and\ncomponents are especially high. According to U.S. intelligence services, China\nis likely providing nitrocellulose to Russia to help Moscow's war effort.\n\nIt\u2019s a risk Brussels is aware of. One EU official, speaking on condition of\nanonymity, said the bloc\u2019s gunpowder manufacturers must diversify sources of\nsupply. They can do that \"either by identifying new producers \u2014 but whose\ncotton they need to re-qualify for powder manufacture, which takes time \u2014 or\nby investing in new solutions such as wood cellulose, which some are already\ndoing,\" the official told POLITICO. \"This work is already underway,\" the\nofficial added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlready in 2022, Finnish-Norwegian ammunition maker Nammo started looking into\nsubstituting tree-based cellulose for the cotton-based cellulose widely in\nuse.\n\nHowever, over-reliance on China goes beyond nitrocellulose, Johansson warned.\nEnvironmental rules need to be overhauled to make it easier for European\ncompanies to diversify their supply chains, he added.\n\nEurope's defense manufacturers \"have to look at the ecosystem and materials\nlike aluminum and titanium, to see what dependencies we have on China, and\nRussia to some extent,\" Johansson said. Before Moscow invaded Ukraine,\nEurope's aerospace giants including Airbus were heavily reliant on Russia for\ntitanium, which is a key material for the defense industry, used for building\nboth military aircraft and submarines. Aluminum can be used for warships and\nmilitary vehicles.\n\n\"Environmental approvals needed to get these materials from other parts of the\nworld, including Europe, take up to 10 years to get approved,\" the Swedish\nexecutive added. \"We can't have it like that if we want to change these sort\nof dependencies going forward.\"\n\nCamille Gijs contributed reporting.\n\nRelated Tags\n\nAerospace Companies Defense Intelligence services Manufacturing Produce Raw\nmaterials Security Services Supply chains War War in Ukraine\n\nRelated Countries\n\nChina Russia Ukraine\n\nRelated People\n\nMicael Johansson\n\nRelated Organizations\n\nEuropean Commission\n\n## Our readers read next\n\n## G7 gives Iran sharp warning not to send ballistic missiles to Russia\n\n28 MINS ago 2 mins read\n\n## \u2018Get the facts straight,\u2019 EU\u2019s Michel tells Trump over Ukraine funding\n\n47 MINS ago 2 mins read\n\n## Ukraine successfully shoots down first Russian strategic bomber\n\n2 HRS ago 2 mins read\n\n## Western leaders call for de-escalation following reports of Israeli strike\non Iran\n\n2 HRS ago 3 mins read\n\n## More from Laura Kayali\n\n## European defense sovereignty doesn\u2019t mean turning away from NATO, says von\nder Leyen\n\nWith Brussels gunning for a leading role on defense, NATO officials worry\nabout overlaps with the military alliance.\n\nApr 17 2 mins read\n\n## French, German arms sales to Israel hit by legal action\n\nWestern nations are under increasing pressure to stop selling weapons to the\nIsraeli government.\n\nApr 12 2 mins read\n\n## France prepares for naval warfare against an enemy that \u2018wants to destroy\nus\u2019\n\n\u201cNaval combat is becoming increasingly likely,\u201d French rear admiral tells\nPOLITICO in an exclusive interview.\n\nApr 10 3 mins read\n\n## EU unleashes arsenal of defense acronyms to fight Putin\n\nCan\u2019t tell your ASAP from your EDIRPA?
