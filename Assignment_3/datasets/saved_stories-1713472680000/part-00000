Now scientists have developed an artificial\nintelligence (AI) tool that outperforms pathologists at identifying the\norigins of metastatic cancer cells that circulate in the body^1. The proof-of-\nconcept model could help doctors to improve the diagnosis and treatment of\nlate-stage cancer, and extend people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty significant finding \u2014 that it can be used as an assistive\ntool,\u201d says Faisal Mahmood, who studies AI applications in health care at\nHarvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n## Elusive origins\n\nTo treat metastatic cancers, doctors need to know where they came from. The\norigin of up to 5% of all tumours cannot be identified, and the prognosis for\npeople whose primary cancer remains unknown is poor.\n\nOne method used to diagnose tricky metastatic cancers relies on tumour cells\nfound in fluid extracted from the body. Clinicians examine images of the cells\nto work out which type of cancer cell they resemble. For example, breast\ncancer cells that migrate to the lungs still look like breast cancer cells.\n\nEvery year, of the 300,000 people with cancer who are newly treated at the\nhospital affiliated with Tianjin Medical University (TMU) in China, some 4,000\nare diagnosed using such images, but around 300 people remain undiagnosed,\nsays Tian Fei, a colorectal cancer surgeon at TMU.\n\nTian, Li Xiangchun, a bioinformatics researcher who studies deep learning at\nTMU, and their colleagues wanted to develop a deep-learning algorithm to\nanalyse these images and predict the origin of the cancers. Their results were\npublished in Nature Medicine on 16 April.\n\n## Tumour training\n\nThe researchers trained their AI model on some 30,000 images of cells found in\nabdominal or lung fluid from 21,000 people whose tumour of origin was known.\nThey then tested their model on 27,000 images and found there was an 83%\nchange that it would accurately predict the source of the tumour. And there\nwas a 99% chance that the source of the tumour was included in the model\u2019s top\nthree predictions.\n\nONA Therapeutics: A fat-blocking drug could help to fight metastatic cancer\n\nHaving a top-three list is useful because it can help clinicians to reduce the\nnumber of extra \u2014 often intrusive \u2014 tests needed to identify a tumour\u2019s\norigins, says Mahmood. The predictions were restricted to 12 common sources of\ncancer, including the lungs, ovaries, breasts and stomach. Some other forms of\ncancer, including those originating in the prostate and kidneys, could not be\nidentified, because they don\u2019t typically spread to fluid deposits in the\nabdomen and lungs, says Li.\n\nWhen tested on some 500 images, the model was better than human pathologists\nat predicting a tumour\u2019s origin. This improvement was statistically\nsignificant.\n\nThe researchers also retrospectively assessed a subset of 391 study\nparticipants some four years after they had had cancer treatment. They found\nthat those who had received treatment for the type of cancer that the model\npredicted were more likely to have survived, and lived longer, than\nparticipants for whom the prediction did not match. \u201cThis is a pretty\nconvincing argument\u201d for using the AI model in a clinical setting, says\nMahmood.\n\nMahmood has previously used AI to predict the origin of cancers from tissue\nsamples^2, and other teams have used genomic data. Combining the three data\nsources \u2014 cells, tissue and genomics \u2014 could further improve outcomes for\npeople with metastatic cancers of unknown origins, he says.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01110-8\n\n## References\n\n  1.
