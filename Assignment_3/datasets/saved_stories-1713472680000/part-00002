Compared to the Kirin 9000S that debuted in the Mate 60\nfamily last year, the Kirin 9010 is a noteworthy upgrade, offering a 12-core\nconfiguration, along with other changes, as you will soon find out.\n\n## Kirin 9010 is not found in all Pura 70 flagships but does gain LPDDR5X RAM\nsupport and more\n\nThe 12-core cluster of the Kirin 9010 is in the \u20182 + 6 + 4\u2019 configuration,\nmaking it a significant upgrade over the 8-core Kirin 9000S. In short, we\nshould witness a boost in multi-core performance, though we should dial down\nthe hype when talking about GPU performance. We say this because, like the\nKirin 9000S, the Kirin 9010 is equipped with a Maleoon 910 GPU. However, there\nis a possibility that we are incorrect in our statement because Huawei may\nhave increased the number of GPU cores on the Kirin 9010 compared to the one\non the Kirin 9000S.\n\n##### Related Story Huawei Pura 70 Series Goes Official With Four Flagship\nReleases, New Kirin 9010 Chipset, Upgraded Cameras And A Bevy Of Improvements\n\nYou can see in the image below provided by @faridofanani96 that the\nperformance cores are limited to 2.30GHz, whereas the Kirin 9000S\u2019 performance\ncores could reach 2.62GHz. Huawei likely downgraded this specification of the\nKirin 9010 to reduce power consumption but compensated this move with a\n12-core configuration, making it a notable upgrade over its predecessor. We\nhave also learned that the new SoC supports the current-generation LPDDR5X\nstandard. However, we cannot find information related to SoC\u2019s lithography, so\nour immediate guess is that Huawei is stuck with SMIC\u2019s 7nm process to mass\nproduce the latest silicon.\n\nYou should also know that the Kirin 9010 does not power the entire Pura 70\nseries, with only the more expensive Pura 70+ and Pura 70 Ultra being treated\nto Huawei\u2019s latest and greatest silicon. We will compare the new SoC with the\nKirin 9000S while discussing the performance differences between the two.\nSince sanctions have bombarded Huawei, making the company technologically\nlimited, it will be unsurprising to learn that the Kirin 9010 is several\ngenerations behind the competition.\n\nHowever, an upgrade is still an upgrade, and we will provide a host of\ncomparisons and performance charts shortly, so stay tuned. As for a meaningful\nchipset release from Huawei, we recommend waiting until later in the year,\nwhen the company unveils the Mate 70 family, as it will likely be fueled by\nthe Chinese firm\u2019s first 5nm SoC.\n\nShare this story\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\n### Deal of the Day\n\n### Further Reading\n\n  * #### Huawei\u2019s Pura 70 Series Could Reach The Same Success As The Mate 60, But That Could Also Result In Low Stock Throughout China\n\n  * #### Huawei Is Killing Off The P Series Flagships In Favor Of A Series Called Pura\n\n  * #### Huawei Rumored To Launch The New Mate 70 Series In October With Upgraded Kirin SoC, Improved Imaging Capabilities; Exact Specifications Not Given\n\n  * #### Huawei Is Reportedly Building A $1.66 Billion Semiconductor R&D Plant, And Has Hired Engineers From ASML To Make This Possible\n\n### Comments\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  * #### Kirin 9010 Is Huawei\u2019s Latest Smartphone SoC With A 12-core CPU Cluster, Is Regarded As A Faster Variant To The Kirin 9000S, Lithography Unknown\n\n45 Active Readers\n\n  * #### Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 Flagships Could Feature High-Capacity 5,500mAh Batteries To Compensate For The Chipset\u2019s Increased Power Consumption\n\n41 Active Readers\n\n  * #### Starfield Is About to Get Some Really Good Updates Soon, Says Howard\n\n40 Active Readers\n\n  * #### Exynos 2500 Rumored To Be Samsung\u2019s First Second-Generation 3nm Smartphone SoC, Beating The Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 In Power Efficiency\n\n34 Active Readers\n\n  * #### It\u2019s Time To Bid Farewell To AMD RDNA 2 \u201cRadeon RX 6000\u201d GPUs, Inventory Hits Rock Bottom\n\n33 Active Readers\n\n### Popular Discussions\n\n  * #### AMD RDNA 4 & RDNA 3+ GPUs Receive Updated Support In Linux Graphics Drivers\n\n1287 Comments\n\n  * #### Intel Arrow Lake-S 24 & 20 Core Desktop CPUs Spotted: Core Ultra 200 ES Chips Without SMT, Up To 3 GHz\n\n1130 Comments\n\n  * #### NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 RMA in China Becomes a Huge Issue, Full Refunds Offered To Affectees\n\n1042 Comments\n\n  * #### Jim Keller Criticizes NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell\u2019s $10 Billion R&D Cost, Says It Could\u2019ve Been Achievable In $1 Billion\n\n921 Comments\n\n  * #### AMD Launches Ryzen PRO 8000 Desktop APUs, Bringing Graphics & AI Leadership To Businesses\n\n774 Comments\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your\ninbox\n\n###### Follow us on\n\nFacebook Youtube Twitter\n\n###### Topics\n\n  * Hardware\n  * Gaming\n  * Mobile\n  * Finance\n  * Software\n  * Security\n  * Web\n\n###### Sections\n\n  * Deals\n  * Reviews\n  * Videos\n  * How To's\n  * Analysis\n  * Exclusives\n  * Interviews\n\n###### Company\n\n  * About\n  * Advertise with Us\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Careers\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy & Cookie Policy\n  * Ethics Statement\n  * Appeal Moderation\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.
