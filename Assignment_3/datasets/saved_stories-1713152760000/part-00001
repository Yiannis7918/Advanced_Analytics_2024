This knowledge-sharing tool is based on\nour global teams\u2019 experience and highlights things you may want to explore on\nyour projects.\n\nTechniques Platforms Tools Languages & Frameworks\n\n  * New\n  * Moved in/out\n  * No change\n\nEach insight we share is represented by a blip. Blips may be new to the latest\nRadar volume, or they can move rings as our recommendation has changed.\n\nThe rings are:\n\n  * Adopt. Blips that we think you should seriously consider using.\n\n  * Trial. Things we think are ready for use, but not as completely proven as those in the Adopt ring.\n\n  * Assess. Things to look at closely, but not necessarily trial yet \u2014 unless you think they would be a particularly good fit for you.\n\n  * Hold. Proceed with caution.\n\nExplore the interactive version by quadrant, or download the PDF to read the\nRadar in full.

Those patterns form the basis of our themes.\n\n## Open-ish source licenses\n\nTwo types of discussions about licenses arose during our meeting. First, for\nmany years, the open-source software development ecosystem relied on a set of\nlicenses, cataloged by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), with a small number\nof popular licenses used in most cases. Recently, however, we\u2019ve seen churn in\nthis previously serene landscape. Several prominent tools have recently\ngarnered bad press, when their maintainers switched \u2014 in several cases\nabruptly \u2014 from an open-source license to a commercial model. We have no\nproblem paying for software and are fine with the common model of commercial\nlicenses for additional functionality. However, we find it problematic when\ncore functionality of a widely used tool is suddenly put behind a paywall,\nespecially when an ecosystem has developed around the tool. Second, the other\ninteresting development concerns software that proclaims to be open source yet\nfundamental capabilities only appear after consumers pay subscriptions or\nother charges. Even though this business model has existed before, it seems to\nbe exploited more with many of the shiny new AI tools \u2014 offering amazing\ncapabilities a little too hidden under the fine print. We advise particular\ndiligence around license issues. Pay attention to caveats and make sure that\nall files in a repository are covered by the license at the top level.\n\n## AI-assisted software development teams\n\nThe topic of AI obviously dominated our conversations; one-third of our blips\nconcerned some aspect of it. While we discussed several developer-focused AI\ntools like GitHub Copilot, Codium AI, aider and Continue, we also had numerous\nconversations about how the holistic use of AI across an entire team changes\naspects of software development. We talked about a variety of tools that\ndidn\u2019t make the final cut, including AI-assisted terminals like Warp, the\nability to convert screenshots to code, ChatOps backed by LLMs and a host of\nother topics. Although the developer tools tend toward a higher degree of\nmaturity, we suspect that all aspects of software development can gradually\nbenefit from the pragmatic use of AI and derived tools, and we're actively\nfollowing innovations across the development landscape. Of course, with the\nalmost magical new capabilities offered by AI come new risks to software\nquality and security. This calls for teams to remain vigilant, including\nkeeping non-developers in the loop about potential hazards.\n\n## Emerging architecture patterns for LLMs\n\nPatterns are popular in the technology world because they provide a succinct\nname for a solution to a particular problem. With the growing use of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we\u2019re starting to see the emergence of specific\narchitecture patterns to support common contexts. For example, we discussed\nNeMo Guardrails, which allows developers to build governance policies around\nLLM usage. We also talked about tools such as Langfuse that allow greater\nobservability into the steps leading to an LLM\u2019s output and how to deal with\n(and validate) bloated code bases full of generated code. We discussed how\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is our preferred pattern to enhance the\nquality of LLM outputs, especially in the enterprise ecosystem. Additionally,\nwe discussed techniques like using a lower-powered (and cost-efficient) LLM to\nproduce material which is selectively vetted by a more powerful (and\nexpensive) LLM. Patterns form an important vocabulary for technologies, and we\nexpect to see an explosion of patterns (and the inevitable anti-patterns) as\ngenerative AI continues to suffuse software development.\n\n## Dragging PRs closer to proper CI\n\nThoughtworks has always been a strong proponent of fast feedback loops during\nsoftware development and thus a big supporter of continuous integration (CI).\nTo assist with adoption, we built the first-ever CI server \u2014 CruiseControl \u2014\nthat was open-sourced in the late 1990s. Recently, our chief scientist Martin\nFowler updated the canonical definition of continuous integration on his bliki\nto renew attention on this practice. However, many of our teams are compelled\nto ignore the CI part of CI/CD because they find themselves in situations\nwhere pull requests (PRs) are mandated. Although the practice of PRs was\noriginally developed to manage massively distributed open-source teams and\nunreliable contributors, they\u2019ve become a synonym for peer review commonplace\neven on small, close-knit delivery teams. In these circumstances, many\ndevelopers yearn for the same sense of flow that they get from practicing\nactual CI. We surveyed several tools that are trying to alleviate the pains of\nPR review processes, including gitStream and Github merge queue. We also\ndiscussed techniques such as stacked diffs that hold promise for aligning with\nthe core principles of CI by enabling more granular control over the\nintegration process and discussed methods for deriving metrics from PRs to\nidentify inefficiencies and bottlenecks during software delivery. Tooling\nhelps tremendously in this space because of the trend toward generative AI for\ncoding. With AI coding assistants, coding throughput increases, which leads to\na tendency to create larger PRs. This puts even more pressure on asynchronous\ncode review processes. Even though we still prefer the original practice of\nCI, we encourage teams who cannot use it because of external constraints to\nfind ways to improve the accuracy of integration and the speed of their\nfeedback cycle.\n\n## Featured Insights\n\nBlog\n\nMacro trends in the tech industry | April 2024\n\nLearn more\n\nBlog\n\nTackling AI risks: Your reputation is at stake\n\nLearn more\n\nBlog\n\nTechnology Radar at volume 30: Why it still matters\n\nLearn more\n\nView more\n\nView less\n\n## Contributors\n\nThe Technology Radar is prepared by the Thoughtworks Technology Advisory\nBoard, comprised of:\n\nRebecca Parsons (CTO Emerita) \u2022 Rachel Laycock (CTO) \u2022 Martin Fowler (Chief\nScientist) \u2022 Bharani Subramaniam \u2022 Birgitta B\u00f6ckeler \u2022 Brandon Byars \u2022 Camilla\nFalconi Crispim \u2022 Erik Doernenburg \u2022 Fausto de la Torre \u2022 Hao Xu \u2022 James Lewis\n\u2022 Marisa Hoenig \u2022 Maya Ormaza \u2022 Mike Mason \u2022 Neal Ford \u2022 Pawan Shah \u2022 Scott\nShaw \u2022 Selvakumar Natesan \u2022 Shangqi Liu \u2022 Sofia Tania \u2022 Vanya Seth \u2022 Will\nAmaral\n\n## Subscribe.
