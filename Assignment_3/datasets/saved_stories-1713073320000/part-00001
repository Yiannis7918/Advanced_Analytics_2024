In this entry, we spoke to Jim, a medical\nprofessional who hasn\u2019t paid his taxes in a decade. (Jim, understandably,\nasked to be identified by first name only.) Jim talked to us about how his\ndelinquency started, how it snowballed, and why he\u2019s finally decided to come\nclean. In addition to being anonymized, this as-told-to interview has been\nedited and condensed for clarity.\n\nI haven\u2019t filed my taxes for a decade. Well, that\u2019s not entirely true. I did\nfile in 2020, but that was only so I could get the stimulus checks. I\u2019m in my\nlate 40s now, so I\u2019ve been living tax-free since my late 30s. I was living in\nCalifornia, where my expenses are high, and I\u2019ve worked a bunch of odd jobs:\ncall centers, food service, hospitality, bartending, and so on. But most\nimportantly, for a long time, I was an alcoholic. I needed to pay the bills,\nand the rest of my money went to alcohol. It was a vicious cycle. The IRS\nwould ask me for money that I didn\u2019t have, because I\u2019d already blown it.\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nI wouldn\u2019t advise anyone to do this. I knew, from the very first time I didn\u2019t\nfile my taxes, that I would need to face the music someday. But, simply put, I\nneeded the money, and I was at a place in my life where I didn\u2019t really care\nabout the potential consequences. I have a middle-class lifestyle now, but\nwhen I first skipped Tax Day, I was making $30,000 a year. And when I looked\nat all of these billionaires\u2014Bill Gates, Elon Musk\u2014who were getting all of\nthese tax breaks, while I was struggling, it was easy to justify my own\ndelinquency. Those men were getting all of these write-offs, but when I\u2019d go\nfile, I\u2019d either have to pay more or it\u2019d be a wash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a while, I would claim nine dependents on my paycheck so my income wasn\u2019t\ntaxed as much each month. It was something I learned from an acquaintance\nyears prior. You\u2019d say that you have nine people dependent on you for half of\nthe year, and for the remaining six months, you switch and say that you\u2019re\nsingle\u2014you know, before you actually have to file your taxes. But I never did\nthat latter part. I just rolled through the last decade like I was supporting\na gigantic family, without ever actually filing to the IRS.\n\nAnd you know what? I basically got away with it. The only time I received a\ncall from the IRS was after I filed to get my stimulus check. They told me I\nowed them some money\u2014like, $700\u2014and I said I\u2019d get back to them. That was it.\nThat was the extent of the conversation. They didn\u2019t say, \u201cHey, we realized\nthat you haven\u2019t paid your taxes in years.\u201d It was weird. I thought to myself,\nMan, I\u2019m pretty sure I owe you a lot more than that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IRS has called a few more times since then, but I recognize the number and\nhaven\u2019t answered. Eventually, that started to drop off too, and I stopped\nhearing from them altogether. As it turns out, all you need to do to stop\npaying your taxes is, well, stop paying your taxes.\n\nThe irony is that I have a government job now. They did a background check on\nme where I had to acknowledge a few DUIs I sustained, and\u2014yes\u2014that I hadn\u2019t\npaid my taxes. To my surprise, I was still brought on to the team. The hiring\nmanager told me that I needed to get up to speed on my finances. I said\nsomething like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll get right on it,\u201d and we haven\u2019t spoken about it\nsince.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Related From Slate\n\n#### Adam Chodorow\n\n### I\u2019m a Tax Professor Who Hates Doing His Taxes. There\u2019s a Big Change\nComing.\n\nRead More\n\nBut that was still a wake-up call. I went through rehab a few years ago, I\u2019m\nsober, and I really don\u2019t want to lose this job, which means I figured it was\ntime, finally, to catch up with the IRS and take responsibility for my\nactions.\n\nSo, in 2024, I have started making up for lost time. I filed the last three\ncycles of my taxes, as far back as 2021. I don\u2019t really know what might happen\nto me or how the government is going to react. The only interaction I\u2019ve had\nwith the IRS since coming clean is a letter stating that the $70 I was set to\nget back from my 2023 paperwork would be going toward what I \u201cowed.\u201d The total\nof the bill is still a mystery to me, but I doubt it\u2019s going to be anything\ngood. One thing is for sure, though: Now that I\u2019m officially in the system,\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be hearing from them soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve done some of my own research into the whole tax-delinquency economy. I\nsaw this ad for a firm that keeps a roster of tax lawyers on staff who would\nmanage all of the bad things that can happen to you if you don\u2019t pay your\ntaxes\u2014wage garnishment, repossession of assets, things like that. The firm\ntells me that the fee is $8,000 for their services, and I\u2019m like, If I had\n$8,000, I\u2019d just go pay my taxes!\n\nBut I have hope that the IRS is going to treat me with empathy. Hopefully I\u2019ll\nbe able to get on some sort of installment plan and all of this will be behind\nme. Every April I\u2019d think about how this could be the moment where everything\nwould fall apart. Sometimes I\u2019d even put my forms into TurboTax and stare at\nthe filing button, knowing if I sent off my documents there was no going back:\nAm I going to get fired? Am I going to go to jail? But then the feeling would\nsubside until the next year and I\u2019d move on. You know what seems priceless to\nme now? Being free of the stress and anxiety, for the rest of my life.\n\nTweet Share Share Comment\n\n  * Addiction\n  * Taxes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### About\n\n  * About Us\n  * Work With Us\n  * Contact\n  * Pitch Guidelines\n  * Send Us Tips\n  * Corrections\n  * Commenting\n  * Reprints\n\n#### Subscriptions\n\n  * Subscribe\n  * Sign In\n  * Account\n  * Subscription FAQs\n  * Podcast FAQs\n  * Newsletters\n  * Customer Support\n\n#### Advertising\n\n  * AdChoices\n  * Cookie Preferences\n\nSlate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\n#### Follow Us\n\nFacebook Twitter Instagram YouTube RSS Feed\n\n  * User Agreement\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9 2024 The Slate Group LLC.
