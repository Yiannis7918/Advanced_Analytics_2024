Personal audio\nhad always been kind of a thing for me: I went through Walkmans, Discmans, MP3\nDiscmans, Minidisc and even, for a while, a 64 megabyte Creative MuVo. Pick an\nalbum for the day, load it on the MuVo and have it on repeat. Finally getting\nan iPod was a game-changer.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t about nostalgia. Or I should say, not just about nostalgia.\n\nLike so many of us, I got an iPhone and put the iPod in its sock one last time\nand closed the junk drawer. Almost seventeen years later, the battery won\u2019t\nhold a charge and its six gigabytes of storage don\u2019t feel as impressive\nanymore.\n\nDespite that, I\u2019ve recently felt drawn to it more and more. Sure, in part\nbecause I\u2019m rapidly approaching 40 and desperately clinging to things from my\nyouth but there\u2019s more to it. A lot more.\n\nI\u2019m trying not to be insufferable about it but I\u2019ve been pursuing mindfulness\nover the past couple of months. Doing a course, meditating, everything. Most\npeople who\u2019ve done this seem unable to shut up about it, and I\u2019m no exception.\nIt\u2019s taught me a lot about myself and about the human mind but I\u2019m not going\nto bore you with that.\n\nListening to music isn\u2019t meditation, or at least not in the opinion of my\ninstructor and I suspect most practitioners would agree with her. To me, it\ndoes at least feel like a mindful experience to take the time to really listen\nto some music. Not in the car or doing chores but having the music be the\nprimary activity.\n\nIn the iPhone era, I somehow lost that habbit. Music became background for me.\nBut music is too beautiful an invention to be wasted as just a tool to drown\nout the noise of an open plan office. It wasn\u2019t an old battery-starved iPod\nMini calling to me from inside the junk drawer, it was music itself.\n\nSo I bought another iPod. An iPod Classic of the last generation, with an\namazing 160 gigabytes of storage. And I\u2019ve been taking the time to sit down\nwith some quality in-ear monitors and just enjoy the music. And it\u2019s been\ngreat.\n\nJust like CDs are just objectively better than vinyl records, the iPhone with\nits access to entire streaming catalogs in lossless quality and modern\ncomforts like Bluetooth is just objectively better than an iPod not\nfundamentally changed since its debut in 2001. But just as the resurgence of\nvinyl isn\u2019t about things you can objectively quantify, my rekindled love for\nthe iPod isn\u2019t about that either.\n\nMy phone is a source of stress for me, as it is for many. When I\u2019m running\nlate for an important meeting at work, it beeps to tell me so. When my boss\ncalls me, it rings or buzzes. When the UK government decides to be even more\ntransphobic, I read about it on Mastodon in Ivory, on my phone. Not to mention\nthe emails. So many emails.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder millennials are buying vinyl records. It\u2019s no wonder Gen Z are\nbuying up old digital cameras on eBay to be \u201cin the moment\u201d. Being connected\nto the online world has brought us many tremendous things and I value it\ngreatly. But there\u2019s something to be said for regularly making a conscious\ndecision to unplug and experience something like music, photography or just\nyour own thoughts.\n\nBut of course, I couldn\u2019t just end it there. I found YouTube is full of people\nre-discovering the iPod. And many of them customize theirs with third-party\nreplacement shells in fun colors. And with new higher-capacity batteries,\nridiculous amounts of flash storage and bluetooth modules.\n\nThis proved to be irresistible to me. So I bought another iPod, one in\nsignificantly worse shape. And a purple casing, new battery, sd-card adapter\nand some other replacement parts like a new display. I\u2019ve come to call it my\niPod Pro Max and it\u2019s amazing what these old devices can still do.\n\nWith this becoming increasingly popular, prices of used and even beaten up old\niPods have skyrocketed. There\u2019s clearly a market, which does beg the question:\nwhere\u2019s Apple? The iPod Classic was discontinued in 2014, a decade ago. The\niPod Touch, the last to carry the name, said its goodbyes in 2022.\n\nDuring this journey I also briefly tried an iPod Touch. This was a big\nmistake. I had to manually remove all the things that remind me of stressful\nthings and distractions like the Calendar app and Messages which all come by\ndefault.\n\nNot to mention when someone calls me, through the magic of FaceTime and\nHandoff (both enabled by default) the iPod also does the dreaded fade-out of\nmusic followed by the default ringtone. The exact opposite of what I\u2019m trying\nto accomplish.\n\nCanceling the iPod Touch was the right call. Leaving the market entirely?\nPerhaps not so much. Unlike printers and wifi routers, there\u2019s magic in the\nrelationship Apple as a company has with music. I think it\u2019s safe to say it\nsaved them and they saved it.\n\nI just can\u2019t help but wonder what Apple could do with the philosophy behind\nthe iPod and all the technological progress its made since the last real iPods\nwere developed. A device specifically focused on the best possible experience\nof listening to music.\n\nWith the ability to wirelessly sync songs from Apple Music from your phone to\nthe device. With an amazing UX beyond the limitations of a clickwheel and with\nmore personality than just a touch-sensitive slate of glass. And all of this\nwith ridiculous battery life thanks to the efficiency of its Apple Silicon S9\nSoC.\n\nI don\u2019t know what such a device would look like but I bet you it would be\ngood. Unfortunately, present-day Apple is not interested in niche-products\nlike that. Many pundits on the Apple beat would insist Apple as a trillion\ndollar company simply can\u2019t do smaller quirkier things anymore - as if it\u2019s a\nlaw of nature.\n\nWe know that\u2019s not true. Sony does it to a ridiculous degree. They even make\nportable music players. They call them Walkmans, like they always have.\n\nBut until Apple starts valuing the iPod the way Sony still values the Walkman,\nmy purple flash-based iPod Classic Pro Max will have to do. And I will enjoy\nevery second of it.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
