It was first used in 1971,\nat a convention of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de la Presse P\u00e9riodique.^[3]\n\nAmerican examples of mooks include Make and Craft.^[4]\n\n## In Japan[edit]\n\nThe format remains popular in Japan, where it has been in use since at least\nthe 1970s.^[5]^[6] An identical format, predating the term \"mook\", existed\nsince the 1950s.^[7]\n\nThe number of new mooks published in one year peaked in 2013, with over 8,000\ndifferent new mooks published. A little over 6,000 were published in 2019.\nSales revenue, however, peaked in 1997 and has been mostly dropping ever\nsince.^[8]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Osawa, Juro (October 20, 2010). \"Meet Japan's 'Brand Mooks': Half-magazine, Half-book, All Hit\".
