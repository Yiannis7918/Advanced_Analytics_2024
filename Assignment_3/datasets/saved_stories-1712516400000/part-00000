A test by\nItalian firm IronLev has provided successful examples of how a magnetic\nlevitation train, or maglev, might work on already existing train tracks. This\nis a huge boon, as the maglev demo proves that Europe could utilize the more\nthan 360,000 kilometers (224,000 miles) of rail tracks found in Europe\u2019s rail\nsystem.\n\nThere are, of course, several benefits to using maglev over traditional\ntrains, such as the one seen in the header image at the top of this article.\nTraditional trains, even those that are classified as \u201chigh speed,\u201d require\nmore energy and also create more vibrations and noise. With a maglev train,\nthough, the vehicle is actually hovering on a cushion of air, meaning it has\nless resistance and makes less noise.\n\nThe really exciting thing about IronLev\u2019s latest maglev demo is the fact that\nthe company says no modifications were made to the tracks that they tested it\non. This means they were able to accomplish hitting speeds of 70 kilometers\nper hour on normal tracks without having to make any changes.\n\nThat means the European rail system likely wouldn\u2019t need to make any other\nchanges on other parts of the track, making it easier to adopt newer\ntechnology like that found in maglev designs. You can, of course, see the\nvideo of the demo for yourself in the video that I\u2019ve embedded above.\n\n#### Tech. Entertainment. Science.

If this\ndemo proves anything, though, it hopefully proves that using maglev to replace\nthe higher carbon-emitting trains of the past is a good move and one that\nwon\u2019t cost us anything beyond designing and building the trains themselves.\n\nAs it stands, maglev trains have been running for decades, with one even\nrunning in Germany during the Cold War from 1989 to 1991. Unfortunately,\ndespite the success seen with those maglev trains, there are still only six\noperational maglev trains in the world today: three in China, two in South\nKorea, and one in Japan.\n\nHopefully, this maglev demo helps enlighten the train industry, and we will\nsee more adoption of the tech going forward. This tech may also prove helpful\nin further advancing the development of gravity trains, which use gravity to\nrecharge their batteries.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: Scientists are already studying how to solve crimes in space using\nforensics\n\n### This article talks about:\n\ntesting\n\nJoshua Hawkins Writer\n\nJosh Hawkins has been writing for over a decade, covering science, gaming, and\ntech culture.
