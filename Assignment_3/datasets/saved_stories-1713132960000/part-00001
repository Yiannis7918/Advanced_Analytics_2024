By far\nthe most controversial is a new etiquette around societal politics at work,\nand the stances we'll take as a company. So to expand on that, here's a\nsegment from what I wrote internally on that topic, as part of the\nannouncement to employees at Basecamp.\n\nAs clich\u00e9 as it may sound, these are very difficult times in many places of\nthe world, and in America in particular. We're constantly confronted with\nterrible tragedies, pulled into polarized political fights, and egged on by\nsocial media to engage.\n\nThere are many places to be involved, exposed, and engaged in those\nconversations. Basecamp shouldn't be one of those places.\n\nBasecamp should be a place where employees can come to work with colleagues of\nall backgrounds and political convictions without having to deal with heavy\npolitical or societal debates unconnected to that work.\n\nYou shouldn't have to wonder if staying out of it means you're complicit, or\nstepping into it means you're a target. That is difficult enough outside of\nwork, but almost impossible at work.\n\nBy trying to have the debates around such incredibly sensitive societal\npolitics inside the company, we're setting ourselves up for strife, with\nlittle chance of actually changing anyone's mind. These types of discussions\nare so difficult that even if we were having them at the best of times,\ntogether in person, with trust batteries fully charged, we'd struggle. And we\nhave none of those advantages right now, so it's not a surprise the results\nhave been poor.\n\nWe also like to tell ourselves that having these discussions with the whole\ncompany is \"healthy\". I used to think that too, but I no longer do. I think\nit's become ever more stressful, unnerving, and counterproductive. No comment\nthread on Basecamp is going to close the gap on fundamental philosophical and\npolitical differences. And we're left worse for wear when we try.\n\nTherefore, we\u2019re asking everyone, including Jason and me, to refrain from\nusing our company Basecamp or HEY to discuss societal politics at work\neffective immediately.\n\nThis includes everything from sharing political stories in campfire, using\nmessage threads to elucidate others on political beliefs that go beyond the\ntopic directly, or performing political advocacy in general.\n\nIf you're in doubt as to whether your choice of forum or topic for a\ndiscussion is appropriate, please ask before posting. But if you make a\nmistake, it's not the end of the world. Someone will gently remind you of the\netiquette, and we'll move on. This isn't some zero-tolerance, max-consequences\nnew policy.\n\nWe encourage you to continue these difficult discussions with willing\ncolleagues on other systems. Signal is an excellent choice that provides end-\nto-end encryption and group support.\n\nWe also encouraged you to exercise your right to activism and political\nengagement outside of work. It's none of Basecamp's business how or whether\nyou choose to spend your time, money, or voice to support charities, causes,\nor political action groups.\n\nNote that we will continue to engage in politics that directly relate to our\nbusiness or products. This means topics like antitrust, privacy, employee\nsurveillance. If you're in doubt as to whether something falls within those\nlines or not, please, again, reach out for guidance.\n\nNext, Basecamp, as a company, is no longer going to weigh-in publicly on\nsocietal political affairs, outside those that directly connect to the\nbusiness. Again, everyone can individually weigh-in as much or as little as\nthey want, but we're done with posts that present a Basecamp stance on such\nissues.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nUnsurprisingly, parts of Twitter is very. disappointed. in. us. And the search\nfor the tweet to serve as a stake for that disappointment is in full swing.\nSeveral contenders have included my tweets about how I find it OK for leaders\nand employees to be political on Twitter. I still do! And I still will be. Not\njust on twitter, but on this here blog as well. These are my personal spaces.\n\nEveryone at Basecamp has been, as you can read from the snippet above,\nactively encouraged to do the same! Bring all your political advocacy to\nwhatever personal spaces you have. Twitter, Facebook, your local advocacy\ngroup, all of it. Just don't bring it into the internal communication\nplatforms we use for work, unless it directly relates to our business. I'm\napplying that same standard to myself, and Jason is too.\n\nAbout David Heinemeier Hansson\n\nMade Basecamp and HEY for the underdogs as co-owner and CTO of 37signals.\nCreated Ruby on Rails.
