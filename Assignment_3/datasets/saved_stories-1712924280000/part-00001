But economists also... rarely\nput the man in the street on their list of suspects.\u201d\n\nEconomists are habitually disappointed by what governments do. Dictatorships\nare the worst offenders, featuring a rogue\u2019s gallery of impoverishing policies\nfrom farm collectivization to backyard steel mills to expulsions of minority\nmerchant classes. But democracies also frequently pursue policies\u2014like\nprotectionism and price controls\u2014that every introductory economics textbook\nconcludes are a costly burden upon the general public. How is this possible?\nHow can majoritarian politics durably sustain policies harmful to majority\ninterests?\n\nThe most popular way to resolve this puzzle is to blame special interests for\nundermining the democratic process. Protectionism hurts most people, but the\nminority which benefits lobbies heavily on its behalf. The main problem with\nthis account, however, is that public opinion research\u2014not to mention everyday\nconversation\u2014routinely finds that the policies that economists do not like are\npopular. The plot thickens.\n\nFor biographies of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat and Ludwig von Mises see the Concise\nEncyclopedia of Economics.\n\nBefore going back to the drawing board to come up with a new explanation, it\nis a good idea to at least investigate whether anyone in the history of\neconomics has already grappled with these difficulties. It turns out that two\neconomists\u2014one French, the other Austrian\u2014worked out a rather sophisticated\naccount long ago. The first is Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat, writing in the mid-19th\ncentury. The second is Ludwig von Mises, who published most of his relevant\nwork a little less than a century later.\n\nOne striking feature of the Bastiat-Mises view is that politicians are\nactually tightly constrained by public opinion. On their account, democratic\ncompetition keeps elected officials in line; if they deviate from majority\npreferences, they lose elections and their jobs. Bastiat affirms that\n\u201c[P]ublic opinion, whether enlightened or misguided, is nonetheless mistress\nof the world.\u201d1 Vestigial departures from democratic principles in\ncontemporary France do not impress him: \u201cPolitical power, the law-making\nability, the enforcement of the law, have all passed, virtually, if not yet\ncompletely in fact, into the hands of the people, along with universal\nsuffrage.\u201d2 His assessment of modern democracy would probably be even less\nqualified.\n\nMises elaborates on Bastiat\u2019s point, freely comparing politicians to\nbusinessmen. Both face intense competitive pressure:\n\nA statesman can succeed only insofar as his plans are adjusted to the climate\nof opinion of his time, that is to the ideas that have got hold of his\nfellows\u2019 minds. He can become a leader only if he is prepared to guide people\nalong the paths they want to walk and toward the goal they want to attain. A\nstatesman who antagonizes public opinion is doomed to failure... [T]he\npolitician must give the people what they wish to get, very much as a\nbusinessman must supply the customers with the things they wish to acquire.3\n\nThe last sentence is especially striking because Mises has boundless\nconfidence in the propensity of entrepreneurs to serve consumer interests:\n\nIn the capitalist system of society\u2019s economic organization the entrepreneurs\ndetermine the course of production. In the performance of this function they\nare unconditionally and totally subject to the sovereignty of the buying\npublic, the consumers. If they fail to produce in the cheapest and best\npossible way the commodities which the consumers are asking for most urgently,\nthey suffer losses and are finally eliminated from their entrepreneurial\nposition.4\n\nIn modern terminology, neither Bastiat nor Mises worries much about\ndemocracy\u2019s \u201cprincipal-agent\u201d problem, its ability to match voters\u2019 wishes and\nleaders\u2019 actions.\n\nHow then can they share others economists\u2019 judgment that democracies\nfrequently select policies contrary to majority interests? The answer is that\nthey question the wisdom of public opinion. According to Bastiat and Mises,\nsystematically mistaken economic beliefs\u2014or, as Bastiat terms them,\n\u201csophisms,\u201d are widespread.\n\nTo take his most famous example, Bastiat accuses the public of \u201cbroken window\u201d\nthinking\u2014ignoring opportunity costs.5 Its members favor wasteful government\nprograms because they fail to consider the alternative uses of wasted\nresources. They want a large military in peacetime because they implicitly\nassume that there is nothing else for discharged soldiers to do. They favor\nfruitless public works projects to \u201ccreate jobs,\u201d not realizing that the taxes\nrequired to fund these projects destroy as many jobs as they create.\n\nBastiat similarly argues that democracies adopt protectionism because the\nmajority mistakenly thinks that imports are bad for the economy:\n\u201cProtectionism is too popular for its adherents to be regarded as insincere.\nIf the majority had faith in free trade, we should have free trade.\u201d6\nUnfortunately, popular views remain influential even if they are wrong, or\npositively confused. \u201cWhen one of these fundamental errors... becomes firmly\nestablished as a conventional judgment, unquestionably accepted and agreed to\nby everybody, it tends to proceed from theory to practice, from thought to\naction.\u201d7\n\nWhen Bastiat rails against popular \u201csophisms,\u201d he is often misinterpreted as\nmerely an economic educator. But his point is much deeper. He is not just\ndescribing the public\u2019s errors, and urging the economics profession to correct\nthem. He is also asserting that until those errors are corrected, they will\ninfluence policy in destructive directions. In other words, Bastiat is laying\nout a descriptive theory of how real-world politics works: The further the\naverage citizen\u2019s views are from the truth, the lower the quality of policy.\nOr as Mises explains:\n\nDemocracy guarantees a system of government in accordance with the wishes and\nplans of the majority. But it cannot prevent majorities from falling victim to\nerroneous ideas and from adopting inappropriate policies which not only fail\nto realize the ends aimed at but result in disaster.8\n\nBastiat anticipated the rise of socialism, but Mises actually lived through\nit. It is therefore unsurprising that Mises above all lamented the public\u2019s\ntendency to underrate the economic benefits of the free market and overrate\nthe economic benefits of government ownership. Thus, in the conclusion of his\nSocialism, he bluntly states that:\n\nThe world inclines to Socialism because the great majority of people want it.\nThey want it because they believe that Socialism will guarantee a higher\nstandard of welfare. The loss of this conviction would signify the end of\nSocialism.9\n\nMises also highlights more specific economic misconceptions, and links them to\nnarrower policies. Like Bastiat, he blames protectionism on the simple-minded\nbut popular view that imports are bad: \u201cThe ultimate foundation of modern\nprotectionism and of the striving for economic autarky of each country is to\nbe found in this mistaken belief that they are the best means to make every\ncitizen, or at least the immense majority of them, richer.\u201d10 Mises similarly\nobserves, in a passage highly relevant to permanent high unemployment in\nmodern Europe\u2019s heavily regulated labor markets, that the average citizen\nfails to connect the dots: \u201cPublic opinion fails to realize that the real\ncause for the permanent and large unemployment is to be sought in the wage\npolicy of the trade unions and in the assistance granted to such policy by the\ngovernment.\u201d11\n\nHow original is the Bastiat-Mises explanation for poor economic policies?\nModern economists often discuss voters\u2019 \u201crational ignorance\u201d\u2014not bothering to\nlearn about problems that they as individuals can do little to change. But\nBastiat and Mises deviate from the usual story in two interesting ways.\n\nFor one thing, most economists focus on voters\u2019 lack of incentive to learn\nabout the details of policy: Which industry is getting what kind of government\nhelp, who is doing what to whom. This counterfactually assumes that state\nintervention is unpopular to begin with. To come to terms with the facts, it\nis necessary to home in on more elementary errors, as Bastiat and Mises\nrepeatedly do. Protectionism exists because the electorate thinks it is a good\nidea, not because they do not know exactly which industries are benefiting.\n\nBastiat and Mises also recognize, as few modern economists do, that it is\noften implausible to see the public\u2019s errors as mundane ignorance. If the\nelectorate merely knew little about economics, its members should essentially\nbe agnostic on the subject. In practice, however, they often enthusiastically\nsupport protectionism, labor market regulation, and other misguided policies\nin spite of their lack of study.\n\nAt the risk of being rude, both Bastiat and Mises characterize the opponents\nof basic economics as willfully illogical \u201cfanatics\u201d rather than simply\nuninformed. Mises does not disguise his irritation: \u201cThe fanatics obstinately\nrefuse to listen to the teachings of economic theory. Experience fails to\nteach them anything. They stubbornly adhere to their previous opinions.\u201d12\nBastiat is more eager to build a dialogue, but he too feels like he is up\nagainst a brick wall of dogmatism: \u201cIt is not my expectation that when the\nreader puts down this book he will cry out, \u2018I know!\u2019 Would to heaven that he\nmight honestly say to himself, \u2018I don\u2019t know!'\u201d13\n\nCouldn\u2019t one shift the blame to interest groups for spreading false\ninformation? As comfortable as this approach sounds, Mises eschews it. If the\npublic believes whatever the interest groups tell them, they can still be\nfaulted for failing to exercise common-sense skepticism.\n\nThe main propaganda trick of the supporters of the allegedly \u201cprogressive\u201d\npolicy of government control is to blame capitalism for all that is\nunsatisfactory in present-day conditions and to extol the blessings which\nsocialism has in store for mankind. They have never attempted to prove their\nfallacious dogmas or still less to refute the objections raised by the\neconomists. All they did was to call their adversaries names and to cast\nsuspicion upon their motives. And, unfortunately, the average citizen cannot\nsee through these stratagems.14\n\nPresumably the average voter understands the general principle that name-\ncalling is not proof. Indeed, calling your opponents names should count\nagainst you; it suggests that you have nothing better to say. If the public\nfinds such messages persuasive, it is because they have chosen to relax\nordinary intellectual standards.\n\nIt should be clear that Bastiat and Mises have a contrarian outlook on\npolitics. It is only to be expected that the general public prefers to blame\npolitical insiders\u2014rather than itself\u2014for bad policies. But economists also\ntend to pin bad policies on special interests, and rarely put the man in the\nstreet on their list of suspects. Although the economics of Bastiat and Mises\nis in many ways quite \u201corthodox,\u201d their economics of politics is decidedly\nnon-conformist.\n\nAll this makes for a stimulating read. But ideas have to be judged primarily\nby their compatibility with the observed facts, not their entertainment value.\nIn my next column, I present surprising evidence that Bastiat and Mises are\nindeed on to something. Modern public opinion data on economic beliefs and\npolicy preferences are hard for the orthodox view to handle, but are\nremarkably consistent with distinctive Bastiat-Mises approach.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.\n\nBastiat, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric (1964a) Selected Essays on Political Economy.
