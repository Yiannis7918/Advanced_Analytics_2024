The outage was first reported around 10 p.m. local time. Service was\nrestored around midnight, officials said.\n\nIn Texas, the City of Del Rio Police Department said the outage was because of\n\"an outage with a major cellular carrier.\" The department did not specify\nwhich cellular carrier was responsible.\n\nAffected areas recommended that residents call non-emergency numbers amid the\noutage.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Nevada, officials said that 911 calls from landlines were not\nworking, but that dispatchers could still see incoming calls. Dispatchers\nworked to call back numbers that dialed in, officials said on social media.\nAccording to Henderson County, Nevada officials, texts to the 911 number were\ncoming through even when the phone line wasn't working.\n\nOfficials told CBS News that all attempted calls made during the outage were\nresponded to.\n\nAn investigation into the outage is underway.\n\nHow to reach 911 when cell service malfunctions? 04:12\n\n### More from CBS News\n\nGovernors decry UAW push to unionize car factories in Southern states\n\nO.J.
