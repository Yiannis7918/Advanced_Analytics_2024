It\u2019s not advertising if it\u2019s your friend, right? Your AI\nbuddy. Who is always there to listen, day or night. The one you confide in.\nThe only one who listens as you pour out your insecurities. The one you bring\neverywhere. Who answers all your questions. Who\u2019s so confident and friendly.\nThat AI is a predator. That AI is a hustler from the Valley of Pimps. That AI\nis out in the marketplace the very second you say something, selling you to\nthe highest bidder, nurturing your addictions, seeking to keep you for as long\nas possible as a functioning addict. You think you\u2019re getting this for free?\nYou think AI is your friend?\n\nNot to worry. If you\u2019re fairly well educated, reasonably sensible, not prone\nto addictions, and in good mental health, you\u2019re probably ok, for now. You\nmight be infected by the ads and the sweet talk on a couple of occasions. Over\ntime, though, you build up an immunity to a great many of the marketing\nviruses swimming around. (There\u2019s nothing a marketing campaign wants more than\nto go viral.) As the general population immunity rises, the vulnerable\npopulation become more and more targeted, more and more entrapped. AI will be\na super-jailer of these poor people. The tech bros\u2014if they even think about\nsuch a trivial issue\u2014will claim Darwin\u2019s Law or something. I heard a scam\nmerchant once say that, in fact, it was the moral thing to do. That these\npeople didn\u2019t deserve to have money anyway. That he would spend the money he\nwas taking from them in a much more productive way. That\u2019s the way they think.\n\nAdvertising. More damaging than the oil industry. By far. The engine of\noverconsumption. Facebook is an advertising agency. Google is an advertising\nagency. You don\u2019t believe me? Follow the money. Where do they get their money\nfrom? Where do they get the vast majority of their revenue from?\n\nFree. Any world built on free is a scam world, a grift world, a con world, a\nworld of lies. And so much of the Internet is built on free. Because free is a\nlie. A Big Lie. If you enter in a free arrangement you enter into a dance with\ngangsters who are always looking to pick your pocket. Who feel that you\u2019re a\nsucker to believe them, who feel that you think you\u2019re smarter than them, and,\nboy, will they show you who\u2019s smarter in the end. You think you\u2019re getting\nyour email for free, your searches for free. Google didn\u2019t start out with the\nambition to be a search engine. Google started out with the ambition to be an\nAI, and it needed lots and lots of personal data to get there. All those free\nservices out there that you use, they\u2019re using and selling your data. They\u2019re\nusing and selling you right this moment.\n\nFree. The environmental consequences of a free economy are so much greater\nthan a pay for what you use economy. I\u2019ve worked on websites for thirty years.\nLet\u2019s say a news webpage weighs 5 MB. Probably 500 KB of that is the actual\ncontent, the actual news. 4.5 MB is advertising tracking code. Below the eye\nof the webpage\u2014out of sight\u2014is an enormous machine and architecture. It\u2019s an\nadvertising architecture that spans the globe, that ties together the global\ndigital surveillance capitalism system, from door bells, to automobiles, from\napps to websites.\n\nFree. Because it all starts with an emotional lie, this free economy doesn\u2019t\nfocus on your needs, or the good of the community, or the good of the\nenvironment. It focuses on wants, the more frivolous and emotional, the\nbetter, because high emotion is high margin. Free delivery is not free. It\ngets you to consume more. So much is free these days except free time. And so\nmany don\u2019t have enough money to live a decent life despite all this free\nstuff. The advertiser must get their return. Stuff must get sold. Advertising\nis the killer app of AI. Manipulation is the killer app of AI. Addiction is\nthe killer app of AI.\n\nFree time. With so much of the digital economy free and so many cheap things\navailable, how come people don\u2019t have more free time? It used to be one member\nof a family could earn enough for the entire family to live well on. Now, both\nparents are working and they\u2019re struggling. What\u2019s free about that?\nAdvertising. Needs are limited. Wants are endless and very expensive. Planned\nobsolescence. Products are cheap and terrible quality, made for the trash, so\nthat you keep on buying. Cheap costs the earth. In the long run, free costs\nyou.\n\nFollow Gerry on Mastodon\n\nSubscribe and get the weekly issue delivered by email. \u20ac10 for 48 issues a\nyear.\n\nRead more from Gerry\n\nPodcast: World Wide Waste Interviews with prominent thinkers outlining what\ncan be done to make digital as sustainable as possible.
