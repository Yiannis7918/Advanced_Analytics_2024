Energy autonomous systems, relying on ambient\nenergy, face operational challenges due to power losses. Recent advancements\nin emerging nonvolatile memories (NVMs) like FRAM, RRAM, MRAM, and PCM offer\nmature solutions to sustain work progress with minimal energy overhead during\noutages. This paper thoroughly reviews utilizing emerging NVMs in\nmicrocontroller units (MCUs), comparing their key attributes to describe\nunique benefits and potential applications. Furthermore, we discuss the\nintricate details of NVM circuit design and NVM-driven compute-in-memory (CIM)\narchitectures. In summary, integrating emerging NVMs into MCUs showcases\npromising prospects for next-generation applications such as Internet of\nThings and neural networks.\n\nKeywords:\n\nembedded NVM; emerging memories; FRAM; RRAM; MRAM; PCM\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nIn recent years, there has been an extraordinary proliferation in the\npopularity and adoption of edge computing, reaching unprecedented levels [1].\nTo prolong the longevity of battery-powered devices, energy conservation\nmodes, such as complete power shutdown (normally-off), can be employed to\nminimize energy consumption during periods of inactivity [2]. Nevertheless, a\nsignificant drawback of this technology is the potential loss of data stored\nin volatile memory, which can result in substantial performance and\nresponsiveness penalties [3]. An alternative approach is the use of energy\nautonomous systems, which are battery-less and depend on the energy harvested\nfrom ambient sources [4]. Due to the unpredictable nature of ambient sources\nand the limitations of energy harvesters, these systems often face operational\nchallenges caused by frequent power losses [5]. Energy-efficient technologies\nare necessary to ensure the preservation of work progress in the event of a\npower failure, regardless of whether the power outage is intentional or\nunintended.\n\nThe conventional strategy to realize intermittent computing involves utilizing\na nonvolatile memory (NVM) as a backup for on-chip volatile memory and\nprocessor states (flip-flops, latches, and registers) [6,7,8,9]. However, the\nprocess of sequential long-distance data movement between the volatile parts\nand the NVM requires many state transitions and significant overheads in terms\nof the execution time and energy [3,10]. To address this issue, emerging NVMs,\nsuch as ferroelectric random-access memory (FRAM), resistive random-access\nmemory (RRAM), magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM), and phase-change\nmemory (PCM), are incorporated into microcontroller units (MCUs).\n\nPrevious reports have proposed two types of FRAM, one based on ferroelectric\ncapacitors (Fecaps) [11] and the other on ferroelectric transistors (FeFETs)\n[12]. A Fecap is a nonlinear capacitor with hysteretic behavior, forming the\nbasis of nonvolatility. FeFETs exhibit nonvolatility due to the property of\npolarization retention in the absence of an externally applied electric field\nin ferroelectrics [13]. FeFETs may have a lower critical voltage for\npolarization switching compared to standalone Fecaps, provided they can be\noperated in the negative polarization-voltage region [14]. An RRAM device is\nbased on a metal\u2013insulator\u2013metal structure and utilizes voltage pulses to\ncreate multi-level conductance levels, including high-resistance state (HRS)\nand low-resistance state (LRS) [15]. The magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) device\nhas a free magnetic layer and a pinned magnetic layer, which are separated by\na thin insulator layer. It has a variable resistance depending on the\ndirection of the write current [16]. PCM devices can modulate conductance\nbased on the material phase, which can be switched by applying heat or voltage\npulses [17]. These memory devices offer faster write times and lower write\nvoltages than Flash memory [18], which makes it possible to provide instant\non/off capabilities for MCUs with near-zero power consumption during the\ninactive phases [2].\n\nBased on the emerging NVMs, nonvolatile static random-access memory (nvSRAM)\nis suggested as a replacement for the two-macro method (SRAM and Flash)\nbecause of its parallel operation and high speed [19]. The store operation of\nan nvSRAM bitcell involves, in nature, programming the nonvolatile elements\naccording to the data held in the SRAM part. The active power consumption of\nnvSRAM has received attention and various strategies have been reported. For\nexample, plate-line charge-share and bit-line non-precharge techniques were\nproposed to mitigate the active power of a 6T-4C nvSRAM [20]. Additionally,\nensuring the reliability of real-time storage and restoration data in the\nnvSRAM is crucial for maintaining a successive workflow and service quality in\nMCUs. A bitcell-circuit-system co-design was employed to improve the\nreliability and scalability of a 64 KB RRAM-based nvSRAM, which was integrated\ninto a 32-bit MCU and achieved a sub-0.1% raw bit error rate between the power\noutages [19]. Prior works have also investigated the possibility of utilizing\nthe emerging NVM as an embedded Flash (eFlash) to enable rapid macro-to-macro\nbackup and recall operations in the event of power loss [12,21,22]. In terms\nof reliable operations, a software-hardware programming configurable framework\nwas adopted to achieve >95% read accuracy and a 1.3% mean error for all\ntargets in a 3-bit mode of a 1 MB RRAM macro [21]. Despite numerous relevant\nstudies, there is still a lack of universally applicable and significantly\neffective technologies for utilizing emerging NVMs as a replacement for SRAM\nand Flash in terms of power consumption, speed, and reliability.\n\nRecently, state-of-the-art MCUs have supported machine learning (ML), allowing\nreal-time data collection, ML model execution, and analysis on low-power\ndevices. This advancement promotes the growth of computational intelligence at\nthe edge by providing benefits such as improved security, privacy, reduced\nlatency, and extended battery life [23,24,25,26]. Nevertheless, the pervasive\ndeployment in edge applications is impeded by the substantial computational\ndemands of ML inference, particularly in high-dimensionality matrix-vector\nmultiplications (MVMs) [27]. To tackle this challenge, the concept of compute-\nin-memory (CIM) was introduced, which integrates high-efficiency computational\nlogic within the memory array to significantly reduce memory and computation\nenergy, thereby enabling the ML implementation on low-power MCUs [28,29,30].\nSRAM-based CIM has gained increasing attention as a promising solution for ML\napplications [31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39]. Nonetheless, it exhibits inherent\ndrawbacks including a high transistor count, limited data storage capacity,\nand unsuitability for long-term data retention, which makes it disadvantaged\nin terms of area, weight density, and event-driven applications [18,28]. In\ncontrast, NVM-based CIM offers low standby power, high density with multi-\nlevel cells, and low system power by eliminating initial data writing [40,41].\nIt also efficiently stores weight-data for neural network models, with its\ncapacity exceeding the mega-bit level. Despite these advantages, NVM-based CIM\nfaces challenges due to memristor nonlinearity, and the need for large write\ncurrents and high-precision sense amplifiers, resulting in increased area and\npower consumption [18,30]. Therefore, this paper reviews existing design\ntechniques for NVM-based CIM, aiming to inspire innovative circuit design\nstrategies to address these challenges.\n\nThis article is a comprehensive review that will discuss the role of emerging\nnonvolatile storage in MCUs. The remainder of the paper is organized as\nfollows. Section 2 discusses the feasibility of replacing SRAM and Flash in\nMCUs with emerging NVMs in terms of key parameters and the control scheme.\nSection 3 explores the design of NVM in an MCU, including the bitcell,\nread/write circuits, macro structure, and peripheral circuits. Section 4\nreviews the design of CIM based on RRAM and MRAM. Conclusions are outlined in\nSection 5.\n\n## 2\\. Feasibility of Replacing Flash and SRAM in MCUs with Emerging NVMs\n\n#### 2.1. Characteristics of Various Storage Types\n\nFigure 1 depicts a prototypical MCU architecture comprising a processing core,\nFlash memory for code and data storage, SRAM for high-speed data access, and\nabundant peripheral devices such as PLL, DMA, UART, SPI, TIMER, WDT, GPIO,\nRTC, and PMU. The memory module primarily determines the power consumption of\nan MCU due to its intrinsic physical characteristics [42]. Therefore,\nselecting the appropriate memory for a low-power MCU is crucial.\n\nFigure 1. Block diagram of a prototypical MCU.\n\nMCUs integrated with Flash memory are commonly used in the commercial market.\nDue to its nonvolatile nature, Flash memory significantly reduces standby\npower consumption compared to volatile memories. However, the active operation\nof Flash memory requires high power consumption attributed to the need for\nhigh-voltage programming and erasing using charge pumps [42]. Moreover,\nintegrating Flash memory into the advanced nodes has become increasingly\ncomplex and expensive due to its limited area shrink capability and growing\ncomplexity, as highlighted in several publications [43,44,45]. In response to\nthese challenges, innovative eFlash designs were investigated, as detailed in\nTable 1 [46,47,48,49]. The SG-MONOS cell, combining split-gate and charge-\ntrapping structures, enhances Flash memory performance and reliability by\nenabling efficient programming through source-side injection (SSI) and\npreventing column current leakage via series connection [46,50]. The eSTM is a\nfloating gate-based cell, gathering the advantages of a conventional split-\ngate NVM cell together with a more compact cell area than a typical 1 T cell\n[49]. By using SG-MONOS and eSTM cell, eFlash macros were successfully\nfabricated at 40 nm and 28 nm with impressive specifications catering to high-\nend automotive applications. Nevertheless, these eFlash macros are constrained\nby low write endurance, making them difficult to use in applications that\nfrequently power down. Furthermore, they tend to encounter elevated\nmanufacturing costs attributable to the intricacy of the fabrication process,\nand persist in facing reliability challenges as the technology node continues\nto shrink.\n\nTable 1. Comparison of eFlash and type-like Flash NVMs in MCUs.\n\nEmerging NVM concepts (such as FRAM, MRAM, PCM, and RRAM) have been\nextensively researched to address these challenges. These alternatives offer\neasier integration into CMOS and lower process complexity [45]. Table 1\ndemonstrates the key features of type-like Flash NVMs based on emerging memory\ndevices [22,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58]. Type-like Flash NVMs refer to the\nemerging NVMs that directly store data in nonvolatile devices without the need\nfor backup and restore operations and perform NOR Flash memory operations by\nimposing voltages corresponding to block-erase, random program, and random\nread. Previous reports indicate that FRAM consumes less power than Flash and\nDRAM, offering fast and high-bandwidth read/write operations [11,15,20].\nNevertheless, from the low clock frequency of FRAM-based MCUs in Table 1, it\ncan be realized that FRAM still suffers from high power dissipation and\nlimited clock frequency constraints when compared with other emerging NVMs. To\nremedy these constraints, a nonvolatile system-on-chip (NVSoC) integrated an\ninstruction cache and increased the frequency to 30 MHz [10]. As indicated in\nTable 1, recent years have witnessed notable advancements in MCUs based on\nRRAM and MRAM, capable of reaching capacities in the megabyte range and\nworking at lower operational voltages. A state-of-the-art MCU utilized four\nkey design techniques to implement a 10.8 MB embedded STT-MRAM macro, which\nachieved the fastest random read access frequency and write throughput among\nreported Flash-replacement MRAMs [59]. However, the limited endurance of RRAM\nand reliability issues of MTJ impede their broader utilization [15,19,54]. PCM\nfeatured an attractive cell size of 0.019 F^2 and attained the largest\ncapacity of 21 MB among the embedded NVMs presented in Table 1. Nonetheless,\nPCM faces challenges due to the crystallization temperature limitations of the\nstandard GST225 material, restricting its applications in consumer temperature\nranges [45]. Recent developments have addressed this issue by using an\noptimized Ge-rich alloy with a higher crystallization temperature and a\ndifferential sensing scheme, enabling memory operations and data retention\nabove 150 \u00b0C in a 32 KB embedded PCM [22]. In conclusion, each type of\nemerging NVM has its unique advantages and disadvantages, necessitating the\nselection of an appropriate storage type based on specific application\nrequirements.\n\nConventional SRAM-based programmable logic has a large area and always\nconsumes static power to maintain the stored data [60,61]. To reduce power\nconsumption, the MCU enters the standby mode and employs multiple strategies\nto curtail the standby power, which is typically attributed to leakage current\ndissipation in the always-on domain. For instance, the cutting-edge ultra-low\nleakage MCU, leveraging 55 nm TFET-CMOS hybrid technology, achieved\nsignificant standby power reduction through innovative TFET-Gated-Ground SRAM\nand voltage-stacking techniques [62]. However, switching between active and\nstandby modes consumes additional power for data transfer between volatile and\nnonvolatile memories [19,42,63]. Therefore, nvSRAM was proposed as a\nreplacement for the traditional two-macro approach due to its high-speed\nparallel operation. The NVM elements and SRAM part are integrated in an nvSRAM\nbitcell by a bit-to-bit connection instead of a macro-to-macro connection\n[19,64]. By storing commonly used routines in the nvSRAM, the startup latency\nand associated energy consumption from data movement can be eliminated,\nenabling more efficient edge computing applications [65].\n\nA comparison is performed in terms of several key parameters, shown in Table\n2, to highlight the performance characteristics of MCUs with volatile SRAM and\nnvSRAM based on emerging memories [19,20,64,66,67,68,69,70]. Conventional SRAM\nconsumes a much higher retention current than the deep-sleep-mode current\nrequired by sensor networks and energy-management systems, particularly as\nprocess geometry scales down. This has prompted investigations into leveraging\nlow-leakage transistors and advanced design methodologies to achieve lower\nstandby power levels. By utilizing thick-gate-oxide transistors with source\nbias control techniques, the retention power of the system was effectively\nreduced to the order of nanowatts [66,68]. However, these transistors\ngenerally cause an increase in memory macro area and active power dissipation,\nrequiring additional techniques for minimizing cell size and active energy. An\nultra-low-voltage MCU featuring single-rail SRAM was developed using 22 nm FDX\ntechnology and an adaptive reverse body bias scheme, achieving a leakage power\nof 6.6 \u03bcW and active power of 6.3 \u03bcW/MHz [67]. Nevertheless, the single rail\nmacro incurs a 20% area overhead compared to the dual rail macro, and a custom\nbitcell design is needed to ensure stable read operations down to 0.5 V,\nthereby amplifying the complexity of the design.\n\nTable 2. Comparison of SRAM and nvSRAM in MCUs.\n\nIn contrast, nvSRAM can be completely powered off during idle periods, thereby\neliminating retention power consumption. The 4T-2MTJ macro, as illustrated in\nTable 2, exhibits the potential to achieve a smaller footprint compared to 6T\nSRAM at the 45 nm technology node, while maintaining an almost unchanged\noperation current over generations compared to the exponentially increasing\ncurrent of 6T SRAM due to MOSFET off-current degradation with scaling [71]. In\naddition, innovative plate-line charge-share and bit-line non-precharge\ntechniques effectively mitigate the active power dissipation from the large\nFecap, making the 6T-4C macro suitable for an electrocardiograph monitoring\nSoC [20]. The 12T-2R nvSRAM showcases a raw restore-BER of less than 0.1%\nbetween power outages, contributing to the realization of an error-free nvSRAM\nmacro with correction techniques [19]. One drawback of this nvSRAM is the 123%\nincrease in area overhead compared to conventional 6T SRAM implemented on the\nsame technology node.\n\n#### 2.2. Peripheral Circuits of Flash and SRAM\n\nThe Flash memory and SRAM exhibit distinct control principles based on their\nspecific functionalities and operational requirements. A typical eFlash system\nis presented in Figure 2a and can be structured into three levels, including\nmemory cells, peripheral circuits of the hard macro (such as sense amplifiers\nand high-voltage generators), and various functional blocks on a system level.\nThe design of memory cells and peripheral circuits plays a vital role in\ndetermining the electrical characteristics and data reliability, and achieving\nthe target specifications of the Flash memory. To realize higher performance\nand reliability in Flash memory, more CG or SL stitch regions may be required\nfor faster rise/fall time or noise suppression. Furthermore, finer array\ndivision and control are needed to suppress the influence of program disturb\non unselected cells, which is caused by sharing nodes among cells during\nprogram and erase operations.\n\nFigure 2. Memory floorplan of a typical (a) Flash and (b) SRAM embedded in\nMCUs.\n\nOn the other hand, the peripheral circuits of a typical SRAM consist of the\ntiming control circuit, the address decoder circuits, the row (X) and column\n(Y) driver circuits, the sense amplifier circuit, the data input and output\ncircuits, and the memory controller circuit. The timing controller\nsynchronizes signal timing for proper operations of all SRAM components. The\nX/Y decoders select specific memory cells, drivers provide necessary voltage\nlevels, and sense amplifiers ensure data integrity during read operations. The\nmemory controller is a critical component, which manages data flow, controls\nread/write operations, and coordinates transfers between the CPU and SRAM. In\nSRAM design, ensuring stability across varying temperature and process\nconditions presents a significant challenge. A proposed SRAM design tackles\nthis challenge by utilizing charge sharing to transfer stored charge from\nlocal bit lines (BLs) to global BLs, thereby ensuring a constant charging\ncurrent for the BLs [66].\n\n## 3\\. Design Considerations for NVM in MCU: A Focus on Three Metrics\n\n#### 3.1. Bitcell Design: Cell Size Focus\n\nFigure 3a,c,e illustrate the classical configurations of nvSRAM bitcells,\nwhich integrate a traditional 6T-SRAM cell with nonvolatile elements and\nadditional access transistors. When continuously powered, the nvSRAM bitcells\nfunction equivalently to standard 6T SRAM cells, storing data in cross-coupled\ninverters with comparable read and write speeds to traditional SRAM. This\noperational state is commonly called \u201cSRAM mode\u201d or \u201cnormal mode\u201d. While\nencountering a power outage, these cells capture the SRAM contents in\nnonvolatile devices just before power loss and then restore the saved state\nwhen receiving power again.\n\nFigure 3. Bitcell structures of (a) a 6T-4C nvSRAM [20]; (b) a 1FeFET FRAM\n[72,73,74,75]; (c) a 8T-2MTJ nvSRAM [64]; (d) a 1T-1MTJ MRAM [76,77]; (e) a\n12T-2R nvSRAM [19]; (f) a 1T-1R RRAM [21,54,78]; and (g) a 1T-1PCM PCM\n[22,79].\n\nThe 6T-4C FRAM bitcell shown in Figure 3a is based on the Fecap, which is a\nnonlinear capacitor with hysteretic behavior. It has a much higher signal\nmargin than the regular FRAM bitcells which utilize a single ended Fecap and\ntwo differential Fecaps, respectively [11]. This is because data are stored in\nall four capacitors in a complementary fashion, which also causes a higher\narea and power cost. Figure 3c shows the structure of the nvSRAM bitcell based\non the SHE-MTJ, which offers significant advantages over traditional two-\nterminal MTJ [64]. Conventional MTJs are challenged by high switching currents\nand the need to balance resistance levels for read/write operations,\ncompromising either writability or read sensitivity [80]. In contrast, the\nSHE-MTJ capitalizes on the SHE effect for enhanced spin generation efficiency\nand offers a low-resistance write path through charge current in the SHE-\nmetal. Moreover, the decoupled read and write terminals facilitate the\nindependent fine-tuning of the MTJ and SHE-metal dimensions, optimizing both\nreadability and writability [64]. In the nvSRAM cell, M7 and M8 serve as extra\naccess transistors that are disabled to separate the SHE-MTJs from the\nstandard 6T SRAM cell for regular SRAM operation, and are activated to realize\nstore and restore operations in the event of a power loss. This approach helps\nto prevent unnecessary write operations on SHE-MTJs when the data stored in\nthe cross-coupled inverters change during continuous power on, thereby\nimproving energy efficiency. The bitcell depicted in Figure 3e adds four\nclock-controlled power-gating transistors (M9~M12) to save energy, and it\nadopts the two-ends nvSRAM scheme [81,82,83] with two RRAM devices in a\nbitcell to improve reliability in low-HRS/LRS scenarios through differential\nsensing [19]. Despite its larger area and energy consumption compared to\nsingle-end nvSRAM cells [84,85,86], this configuration offers a superior sense\nmargin and restoration yield for emerging NVM technology. It is possible to\nsimplify the 12T-2R bitcell by replacing the M9, M11 pair and M10, M12 pair\nwith a single transistor, respectively, but it is less efficient than\nrealizing a compact transistor pair through area-sharing. The 12T-2R bitcell\nhas an area overhead of approximately 123% when compared to a conventional\nsideway 6T SRAM bitcell at 130 nm [19]. Despite the ability of nvSRAM to\ncombine the fast read/write characteristics of SRAM with the non-volatility of\nNVM, the cell structure based on 6T SRAM limits the reduction in cell size,\nresulting in poor scalability. When the extra area overhead outweighs the\nenergy benefits it brings, the significance of this design becomes less\nevident. Therefore, nvSRAM struggles to achieve high-capacity storage and\ncannot effectively replace traditional embedded NVM in MCUs.\n\nFigure 3b,d,f,g illustrate the standard type-like Flash bitcells, in which\ndata are directly written into nonvolatile elements to eliminate the\nrequirement for data backup and restore operations across power losses. Figure\n3b displays a 1FeFET bitcell that leverages FeFET polarization for storing\ndata and performs NOR flash memory operations in a NOR-type array. Two\narchitectures for 1FeFET-based NOR Flash were introduced in [73]. One\narchitecture offers a high level of scalability, achieving 6 F^2 at a minimum\nby sharing the source lines in pairs of rows, while the other features more\nisolated cells, resulting in reduced disturbance but at the expense of\nscalability. A 1T-1FeFET bitcell with separate read and write paths was\nreported in [87], achieving non-destructive read and lower write power at iso-\nwrite speed compared to 1FeFET FeRAM. However, a slight area penalty is\nintroduced due to the additional MOSFET. Furthermore, a 2T-1FeFET bitcell with\nseparate read/write paths was designed to enhance design flexibility for CIM.\nAlthough the 1FeFET/1T-1FeFET bitcells are more compact, they require\nadditional bias circuitry and/or charging of all non-selected WLs and BLs\n[75,88]. These introduce energy penalties and design complexities owing to the\nneed for multiple voltage levels, rendering them less ideal for intermittently\npowered systems [12].\n\nFigure 3d,f,g demonstrate a similar bitcell structure consisting of a MOSFET\nas an access transistor and a nonvolatile device as a storage element.\nEmerging NVMs based on this bitcell structure commonly serve as a replacement\nfor embedded NOR Flash and show write speed and energy advantages over NOR\nFlash. The 1T-1MTJ bitcell, shown in Figure 3d, was reported and a local\nsource line (SL) array scheme was implemented to improve write performance\n[77]. This scheme utilizes a local SL to distribute return current among\nunselected BLs for preventing select transistor TDDB stress, and it ensures no\ndisturbance occurs in unselected BLs during write operations by connecting a\ngroup of MTJs to the local SL. It also enables the concurrent writing of 0 or\n1 states without needing to elevate BLs, enhancing write efficiency in MRAM.\nFigure 3f illustrates a 1T-1R bitcell occupying an area of 20 F^2 [54], which\nis more compact than earlier FRAM [89,90], STT-MRAM [16,76], and CBRAM [91,92]\ndesigns. The RRAM was equipped with a novel sense amplifier and a write-and-\nverify (WAV) voltage generator to increase the read and write yield. The\n1T-1PCM cell, shown in Figure 3g, is fabricated by 0.11 \u03bcm BCD technology and\ncovers an area of 0.7 F^2. It utilizes a Ge-rich alloy for a higher\ncrystallization temperature [93] compared to the conventional Ge_2Sb_2Te_5\nalloy, and it adopts differential sensing to mitigate resistance drift\n[94,95,96]. These features enable reliable memory operations and data\nretention at temperatures above 150 \u00b0C [22].\n\n#### 3.2. Read/Write Circuit Design: Power Efficiency Focus\n\nAs for read schemes for NVM, there are two typical sense amplifiers (SAs): the\nvoltage-mode SA (VSA) and the current-mode SA (CSA). The VSA is used for\nprecharging selected BLs to a target voltage, allowing the reading of both LRS\nand HRS cells. However, the limited voltage difference between HRS and LRS\ncells makes it susceptible to BL noise and coupling [97]. The CSA imposes a\nfixed bias voltage on the BL to induce current in the cell for reading. A\ncurrent comparator is used to compare the sensed current with a reference\ncurrent. Compared with VSA, the CSA minimizes the vulnerability to BL noise\nand coupling. Moreover, it exhibits faster read speeds than VSA when the BL\nlength of a 0.18 \u03bcm RRAM macro exceeds 128 rows [97].\n\nThe read scheme proposed in [54] uses two types of CSAs to limit the read\nvoltage to 0.3 V and avoid read disturbance, as shown in Figure 4a. By\ndetecting the current of a RRAM cell at 0.3 V, unwanted state transitions,\nespecially in the HRS, can be prevented. Current mirrors are used to provide\nmagnifying power modes and compare the transformed voltage with the reference\nvoltage (VREF) to determine the logic output. A modified VSA was presented for\nsingle-ended FeFET NVM, with duplicated read-BL voltages across two cross-\ncoupled, inverter-based SAs connected to VREF-NAND and VREF-NOR during\nsampling [12]. During read operations, the SA with VREF = 0.95 V is enabled to\nsense the stored bit, with the inverted NOR output serving as the final READ\n(or OR) output. A fully configurable offset-tolerant CSA was reported\npreviously [21], which can be tuned by software for precharging, calibrating,\nand latching. The design includes a dual-mode reference generator that can\nswitch between a compact current-mirror-based mode and an accurate resistance\nnetwork-based mode, providing a wider range of reference currents for multi-\nbit programming and read requirements.\n\nFigure 4. Circuit schematic of (a) a sense amplifier [54]; (b) a write driver\n[22].\n\nThe design of write peripheral circuits plays an important role in determining\nthe write error rate and power consumption of NVM, particularly in the case of\nSTT-MRAM. The challenges in write operations arise from the need for both a\nsufficiently long write time and a high write voltage to avoid errors [98].\nHowever, the exact write time for each STT-MRAM cell differs due to process\nvariations and thermal fluctuations. To ensure reliable writing, the write\ntime is typically kept much longer than the average write time, causing energy\nwastage as the write current continues to flow even after the MTJ has switched\n[99].\n\nThe enhanced current programming circuitry depicted in Figure 4b improves\nRESET pulse shaping in high-parallelism programming scenarios by introducing a\nfast recovery method [22]. By incorporating an additional branch with\ntransistor PP, the circuit ensures the rapid discharge of node A during\nprogramming pulses, allowing precise control of the current flowing through\ntransistor P1. This approach eliminates the need for the precise matching of\nNMOS transistors and enables higher parallelism without increasing static\npower consumption or area occupation. Additionally, adjusting the values of\nfactors \u03b1 and \u03b2 determines the circuit speed and the timing of turning off\ntransistor P1, offering flexibility and efficiency in current programming\noperations.\n\nFurthermore, the write termination scheme has been extensively discussed in\nprevious research as an effective method for addressing the issue of energy\nwaste during write operations. In this context, the energy waste arises from\nunnecessary write operations, which occur when the incoming data equal the\ncurrent value stored in the memory cell. The self-write-termination (SWT)\ncircuit monitors the write operation and prevents redundant writes, thereby\nimproving energy efficiency and reliability in fast-switching cells. As\nreported in [99], the implementation of an SWT circuit leads to a remarkable\n83% reduction in total write energy compared to conventional write circuits.\nAdditionally, this approach utilizes 75% fewer transistors than previously\nproposed SWT circuits. In another study [52], the integration of SWT into each\ncolumn of a 1-macro nvSRAM array demonstrates improved clock frequency and\nsubstantial reductions in store energy, up to 172\u00d7. Although considerable\nprogress has been made, challenges remain in mitigating the extra power\nconsumption and large area overhead associated with the SWT circuits.\n\n#### 3.3. Macro Structure and Peripheral Circuit Design: Area Efficiency Focus\n\nThe memory controller serves as a crucial component in managing data transfer\nbetween the CPU and memory modules in an MCU. It controls operations such as\nthe reading, writing, and refreshing of memory modules to ensure that data are\ncorrectly stored and retrieved. In response to increasing demands for higher\nspeed, lower power consumption, and an enhanced reliability of memory in\nvarious applications, previous studies have reported diverse memory\ncontrollers which integrate additional circuit modules to support\nfunctionalities beyond basic operations, as shown in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5. Structure diagrams of (a) a 1 MB RRAM macro [21]; (b) a 2.25 MB\nRRAM-based CIM macro [100]; (c) an adaptive RRAM-based nvSRAM macro [101]; and\n(d) a 256 KB RRAM macro [54].\n\nIn recent years, MCUs with low-power and instant-on features have been highly\nvalued for energy harvesting as well as \u201cnormally off\u201d applications.\nUnfortunately, the conventional data backup strategy tends to store all\ncontents from volatile parts into the NVM, even though most of the data are\nrarely changed or utilized in practical scenarios. To reduce unnecessary\nbackup operations, a space domain controller was designed, as shown in Figure\n5c, to provide the proper store address range of the nvSRAM [101]. The SWT\ncircuit in each column detects bit changes and controls the write driver on\nthe RSL line to terminate the SET or RESET operations as required. This\napproach eliminates the need to redundantly store or restore unused data,\nleading to reduced time and energy consumption during storage and restoration\nprocesses. A similar strategy was also adopted in [21], as depicted in Figure\n5a. The memory controller supports the pre-read function that allows the\ncontroller to assess the resistance range of the RRAM device before writing to\nreduce redundant write operations. For restore operations, an adaptive\nparallel controller (Figure 5c) was employed to manage different restore\nparallelism options (1 WL/4 WL/16 WL) based on the maximum tolerant peak\ncurrent of the power source and to restore the speed requirement, which\ncontributes to the realization of the instant-on operation of the MCU. It is\nalso common to utilize a memory controller for the power management of memory\nmacros. As shown in Figure 5b, the memory controller deactivates the power\ngates of unselected RRAM modules, and it fully powers down the RRAM after a\nsufficient period following the last event, leading to an 89.21% reduction in\npower usage [100].\n\nIn memory design, reliability is crucial for ensuring data integrity and\nsystem stability, particularly in aerospace systems, medical devices, and\nautonomous vehicles. As illustrated in Figure 5d, a custom RRAM controller\nenhances yield to approximately 100% by integrating features such as built-in\nself-test, built-in self-repair, a shortened Bose\u2013Chaudhuri\u2013Hocquenghem (BCH)\nerror-correlating code (ECC), and asymmetric coding [54]. Significantly, it\nenables adaptive ECC algorithm selection (Hamming or BCH code), resulting in\nimproved performance with reduced power consumption, minimized parity bit\noverhead, and increased operation speed. The memory controller shown in Figure\n5a is also equipped with an ECC module (ECC encoder and ECC decoder) to\nrectify erroneous bits utilizing the BCH algorithm [21].\n\nThe voltage generator is also a critical component in the memory macro,\nproviding essential and precise voltage references for various operations. For\nexample, two types of voltage generators, illustrated in Figure 5a, serve\ndifferent purposes. The on-chip reference and voltage generator supplies\nconstant and temperature-compensated references through the bandgap circuit,\nadjusting to accommodate diverse programming and readout needs [21]. The\nintegrated charge pump produces a high voltage for the forming/set operation\nof the ReRAM. Additionally, a dual-mode reference voltage generator was\ndesigned to meet the diverse requirements of multi-bit storage memory. The\ncurrent-mirror mode offers a wide range of reference currents for multi-bit\nprogramming needs, while the resistance network mode supports high/low-\nresistance states with high linearity, ensuring accurate voltage references\nfor programming and readout. The integration of these circuits eliminates the\nneed for off-chip references or high voltages, greatly simplifying the system\ndesign and connectivity. Furthermore, the design of the voltage generator can\nalso enhance the reliability of memory. As illustrated in Figure 5d, the WAV\nvoltage generator produces eight stepwise voltage levels in the BL or SL path,\naiming to enhance write yield by mitigating variations in the transition\nenergy of individual cells [54].\n\n## 4\\. Circuit Design for CIM Based on RRAM and MRAM\n\nAmong emerging NVMs, RRAM and MRAM are the primary choices for embedded\nnonvolatile CIM due to their advantageous characteristics. RRAM exhibits a\nrelatively larger on/off ratio than MRAM, less power consumption than PCM, and\na higher compatibility with CMOS process than FeFET [30,102]. Moreover, its\nefficient performance in MVM operation with a crossbar structure has aroused\nextensive attention as a promising candidate to implement embedded NVM-based\nCIM [41,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95]. On the other hand, spintronic devices\nprovide a superior solution for nonvolatile logic-in-memory (LIM)\narchitecture, enabling the efficient integration of a broad memory bandwidth\nin logic circuits [103,104]. STT-MRAM, as a representative spintronic memory,\nstands out for its lower access latency, superior endurance, and better\nprocess variation control compared to RRAM and PCM, making it well suited for\nembedded CIM [103,105,106]. Two silicon-validated examples of CIM will be\nreviewed later to explore the considerations in CIM design based on RRAM and\nMRAM technology.\n\nTraditional RRAM-based CIM designs face two major issues in energy harvesting\nsystems [107]: (1) the digital-to-analog (D/A) and analog-to-digital (A/D)\nconversion circuits between the RRAM array and the CPU significantly reduce\nenergy efficiency and increase chip size; (2) all access transistors have to\nbe turned on during each MVM operation, resulting in high sneak currents and\nunnecessary energy consumption. To overcome the existing limitations, a\nredesigned low-power MVM engine (Figure 6) has been introduced, which\nincorporates a binary interface and input-controlled access transistors [107].\nBy incorporating the binary interface, a direct link is established between\nthe binary input vector and the WLs, with outputs obtained through the\n1-to-3-bit adaptive SAs at the end of the BLs. This cuts out the A/D and D/A\noverheads, saving 44% in energy and 95% in area. Moreover, a 64% energy\nreduction is achieved by keeping access transistors off when inputs are zero.\nThe proposed structure provides notable benefits particularly for networks\nwith binary weights and input/output and contributes to the development of a\nsmart processor that attains an energy efficiency of 462 GOPs/J at a clock\nfrequency of 20 MHz.\n\nFigure 6. Architecture of an RRAM-based MVM engine for processing-in-memory\n[107].\n\nPrevious research has mainly focused on small-scale primitive logic-circuit\nelements, memory-like structures like FPGAs and filters, or simulation-based\nassessments, due to the lack of a well-defined design process tailored to MTJ\ntechnology in the chip fabrication environment. From this point of view,\ndesign flows for MTJ/MOS-hybrid logic circuits have been presented to realize\npractical-scale logic LSI based on a nonvolatile LIM architecture [103,108].\nUtilizing the design flow, Figure 7 showcases a compact MTJ-based full adder\n(FA) with nonvolatile LIM architecture, enabling efficient, fully parallel\nprocessing for high-speed motion-vector extraction. The proposed FA exhibits a\ndynamic power consumption of 16.3 \u03bcW at 500 MHz, significantly lower than\nCMOS-only-based FA designs. A motion vector prediction unit was developed,\ncomprising twenty-five processing elements (PEs) equipped with the reported\nFAs. It maintains intermediate data in nonvolatile memory, enabling precise\npower control during each operation cycle, which further diminishes leakage\npower and total power consumption [61].\n\nFigure 7. Circuit diagram of an MTJ-based nonvolatile full adder [61].\n\nTable 3 shows a comparison of state-of-the-art CIM designs based on volatile\nSRAM [36,38,39,109] and emerging nonvolatile memories\n[100,110,111,112,113,114]. For SRAM-based CIM design, various techniques were\nproposed to efficiently perform multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, such as\nbit-serial multiplication and parallel adder trees [109], a segmented-BL\ncharge-sharing scheme [38], and a time-domain incremental-accumulation scheme\n[39]. Additionally, innovative circuit structures and schemes, including 6T\nlocal-computing cells [36], source-injection local multiplication cells,\nprioritized-hybrid-ADC [38], and dynamic differential-reference time-to-\ndigital converter [39], were incorporated to reduce energy consumption.\nConsequently, these SRAM-based CIMs achieved superior output accuracy, fast\noperation speeds, and high energy efficiency. Nevertheless, the limited\ncapacity, volatility, and large leakage current impeded their deployment in\nintricate neural network architectures. As depicted in Table 3, a mass storage\ncapacity of 2.25 MB was attained utilizing RRAM, leveraging its compact\nfootprint enabled by the 1T1R structure [100]. On the other hand, MRAM\nachieved accelerated computational speeds compared to RRAM, with a latency of\n5 ns for 1-bit input and 1\u20138-bit weight configurations [114]. Additionally,\nthe nonvolatility of emerging memories allowed the complete power-down of\nunselected cells, leading to substantial reductions in standby power and\nthereby enhancing energy efficiency when compared to SRAM-based CIMs.\n\nTable 3. Comparison of state-of-the-art CIM based on SRAM, RRAM, and MRAM.\n\n## 5\\. Conclusions\n\nThe rapid progress of edge computing has led to a growing need for emerging\nNVM technologies with low power consumption, high speed, and long-term\ndurability. This paper explores the potential of four emerging NVMs in\nreplacing conventional MCU memories and demonstrates their unique advantages.\nThe discussion on NVM circuit design focuses on bitcell structures, read and\nwrite circuits, and macro structures, summarizing existing strategies for\noptimizing area, energy, and reliability. Moreover, previous works indicate\nthat RRAM and MRAM offer notable benefits in CIM applications. Novel circuit\ndesigns, such as a binary interface structure and spintronic device\nintegration, are effective in improving area and energy efficiency in CIM\nmacros. As a future prospect, there is a need for universally applicable and\nenergy-efficient strategies to leverage emerging NVMs in both MCUs and CIMs.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nMethodology, L.Q.; investigation, J.F.; writing\u2014original draft preparation,\nJ.F.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.Q. and H.C.; visualization, Z.F. and J.F.;\nsupervision, L.Q. and H.C.; funding acquisition, L.Q. and H.C.
