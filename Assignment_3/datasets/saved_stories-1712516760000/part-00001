It was found in 1936 in the north of the Saqqara necropolis in\nmastaba S3111, the grave of the ancient Egyptian official Sabu after whom it\nis named. The function and meaning of the carefully crafted natural stone\nvessel are unclear.\n\n## Description[edit]\n\nThe artifact, made of schist (a term previously used in Egyptology for weakly\nmetamorphic siltstone^[2]), is in the shape of a shallow bowl with a diameter\nof 61 centimetres (24 in) and a maximum height of 10.6 cm (4.2 in). There is a\ncentral hole with a diameter of about 8 cm (3.1 in), which is fitted with a\nsocket whose height corresponds approximately to the depth of the bowl. From\nthe slightly raised outer edge, three wings or lobes are folded inwards\ntowards the central hole, with the outer edge remaining in the form of narrow\narches that connect the non-folded parts with each other. When viewed from\nabove, it therefore resembles a steering wheel with three very wide\nspokes.^[3]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nSabu's grave was discovered on January 19, 1936, by the British archaeologist\nWalter Bryan Emery. It is a mastaba tomb that consists of seven chambers. In\nRoom E, the central burial chamber, the disk was found in a central location\nright next to Sabu's skeleton, which was originally buried in a wooden\ncoffin.^[4] The slate object was broken into several fragments and was later\nrestored.^[5] It is currently on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.^[2]\nA copy of the artifact is on display at the Orient Pavilion of Jungfrau Park,\nfounded by Erich von D\u00e4niken.^[6]\n\nFinds of large flat stone bowls from the First to Third Dynasties are\ngenerally not uncommon.^[2] During this period of Ancient Egypt, the\nproduction of stone objects generally peaked,^[7] and several high-quality\nslate objects of similar origin were found in Saqqara.^[8] However, due to its\ndesign the disk is considered a unique piece in Egyptology.^[9]\n\n## Interpretation[edit]\n\nThe discoverer Emery tentatively interpreted the artifact as a vessel placed\non a stand because of the central hole, but no remains of such were found.\nHowever, it should be taken into account that mastaba S3111 was not untouched\nwhen Emery discovered it, but like many other ancient Egyptian tombs had been\nlooted by grave robbers centuries before. Since the production of a metal\nobject shaped like the Sabu disk would be easy, but very complex if it were\nmade from easily splintered rock, it has been assumed that the disk may have\nbeen an imitation of a metal object.^[10]^[11] Early reports of the discovery\ndubbed the find a \"mysterious vessel\" and speculated that it may have been a\ngigantic lamp.^[12] In popular and unscientific publications, an English\nengineer named William Kay is quoted as having further developed this\nhypothesis. According to him, the bowl was used as a three-flame oil lamp\nduring ritual activities and was placed on a holder for this purpose.^[2]^[13]\nAnother hypothesis states that the bowl could only have served a decorative\npurpose because of its fragility.^[2]\n\nIn Egyptology, apart from the brief reports mentioned, there was no extensive\ndiscussion of the disk and its function. Some ancient astronaut fringe\ntheorists believe the object is an out-of-place artifact, i.e. an object that\nwas found in a place where it \"does not belong\". According to this theory, the\nsignificance of the disk can be recognized, besides its unique form, by the\nfact that it was placed in the center of the burial chamber, and not Sabu's\nremains. In addition, its appearance resembles the symbol for radioactivity.\nZecharia Sitchin believes it is a flywheel for flywheel storage.^[14]\n\nAt the Airbus research center, copies of the disk were made using a 3D printer\nand the physical properties of the disk were examined. The copies had\naerodynamic properties, and could serve as flying disks. However, due to their\nrotational symmetry (or non-chirality), use as a propeller or turbine is\nimpossible. It was also shown that it was possible to use the disk as an oil\nlamp.^[15]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Emery, Walter B. Great Tombs of the First Dynasty.
