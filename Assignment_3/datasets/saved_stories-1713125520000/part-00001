Some will have used\nmainframe systems in the past, perhaps in environments where computer access\nwas via a mainframe and thin client. In those situations, the client was a\ndumb terminal, and the computing work was done elsewhere by a central\nmainframe facility.\n\n### READ NEXT\n\n#### IBM and NASA collaborating to study climate change using AI\n\nBut mainframes are still in everyday production in some industries, and the\nmarket for new mainframe hardware and compatible software continues to grow\nwhere \u201ctransactional\u201d computing is central to effective operations.\n\nThe new IBM LinuxONE 4 Express is a piece of hardware designed for smaller\norganizations, and it represents the baby of the breed, offering a low-cost of\nentry with pre-configured hardware options. The company also emphasizes its\ncyber-resilience, with hardware security systems it terms \u201cSecure Execution.\u201d\nThe hardware has some high security clearance standards, including Common\nCriteria EAL 4 and DISA STIG certifications, and FIPS 140-3 compliance.\n\nUsers can choose their preferred software platform, with SUSE now offering its\nLinux Enterprise Server for IBM Z as part of a bundle that can also come with\nSLE Live Patching, SUSE Manager Lifecycle Management Plus, SLE High\nAvailability, and a long-term service package. The Secure Execution hardware\nmeans multiple containerized applications can be run simultaneously in\nisolation. That makes the system ideal for multi-tenancy operations or\nparallel application spaces that are effectively separated from each other.\n\nIBM LinuxONE Express. Image: IBM.\n\n## Mainframe computer benefits\n\nWhile similar secure and powerful environments can be created using several\nx86 servers, mainframes represent a more sustainable approach to hardware and\npower use. Expansion of storage, memory, and processing capacity over time\nmakes this style of hardware a more attractive long-term prospect: the use of\nfewer components obviously reduces environmental impact and makes hardware\nmaintenance plans simpler to budget.\n\nWhile the initial cost (from $135,000) may seem high as a line item on a CAPEX\nsheet, enterprises with large cloud provider bills may see an effective return\non investment sooner than they think. Depending on use cases, third-party\nclouds\u2019 abilities to scale and provide agility are often seldom used. That\nmeans large organizations pay for capabilities they may rarely make use of.\n\n## Transactional computing\n\nThe continuing existence of a thriving market in mainframe computing stems\nfrom the need for accurate transactional computing in a growing number of\nverticals. Transactional computing can be best described as a way that\ncanonical records of all aspects of a single transaction can be kept, with\neach element of one transaction being required to be successful for a record\nto be made, changed, or deleted.\n\n### READ NEXT\n\n#### IBM pioneers the enterprise AI field with watsonx\n\nFor example, in an e-commerce business, a transaction would comprise of moving\nfunds from a bank account to a vendor via a payment provider. If one of those\nsteps fails (and each comprises several sub-steps), the transaction has not\noccurred, so the only record made is one flagged as a failure. Therefore, the\nemphasis in computing terms is not on raw processing power (the main\nrequirement for supercomputing, for example) but on the integrity of database\nentries. That emphasis doesn\u2019t necessarily require a different computing\narchitecture, but it\u2019s one that comes built into the design specifications of\nmainframes.\n\nFor that reason, banking and financial services, for example, still rely on\nmainframe technologies. But as the scale of internet use grows, more\nindustries rely on the type of security, reliability, and data veracity that\nmainframe methodologies (still) excel at. Other use cases may be found in\nhigh-volume e-commerce marketplaces, engineering facilities that rely on\nmultiple IIoT nodes, and power distribution networks, to name just three\nexamples.\n\n\u201cMainframe computer\u201d by scriptingnews is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0.\n\n## Business case for mainframe computers\n\nSoftware optimized for transactional computing, whether monolithic or based on\nmicroservices, is available from several vendors: LinuxONE hardware will run\nRed Hat, SUSE, and Ubuntu. The LinuxONE Express hardware range contains (at\nbase version) 16 IBM IFL systems (Integrated Facility for Linux), expandable\nto 68 IFL instances. The Emperor LinuxONE range supports over 200 for those\nlooking for more grunt.\n\nThe size and power of mainframes make them ideal for placing data and\napplications in the same place. IBM quotes an example of medical data and\nmedical claims software sharing the same hardware tenancy, allowing for faster\nclaim assessment. Similarly, for businesses looking to consolidate their\nserver fleets, either in-house or leased from cloud providers, an Express\ninstance can replace up to 2,000 x86 instances (manufacturer\u2019s claim: YMMV).\n\nMany IT decision-makers are coming to the conclusion that hyperscale cloud\nproviders are not offering their services with end-user advantage front of\nmind. To grab a single example, Microsoft\u2019s Q4 net income was $21.9 billion in\n2023. While cloud computing still suits many, financial decision-makers might\nquestion the value for money their organization gets from their existing\nagreements with hyperscalers. That element of doubt and an increased need for\nreliable transactional processing will make the capital expenditure option\nlook increasingly attractive to many.\n\nThe Express mainframe range can be sourced directly from IBM or approved\npartners.\n\n###### The Express is not your meemaw\u2019s mainframe.\n\nArtificial Intelligence Business Intelligence\n\nSHARE\n\nJoe Green\n\n@More_Hybrid\n\njoe@hybrid.co\n\nAll stories\n\nTiny VLMs bring AI text plus image vision to the edge\n\n7 March 2024\n\nHugging Face Safetensors vulnerable to supply chain attacks\n\n7 March 2024\n\nTazama offers Know Your Customer options for all\n\n6 March 2024\n\nAbout Advertise with us Contact\n\nHybrid brands Jobs @ Hybrid.co\n\nBristol Kuala Lumpur Sydney\n\n\u00a9 2024 Copyright TechHQ | All Rights Reserved\n\nTerms of use Privacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
