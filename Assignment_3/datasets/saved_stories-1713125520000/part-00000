(Credit: Lo\u00efc Venance / AFP /\nGetty Images)\n\nWhat\u2019s another name for France? The French have several options. One is la\nFrance m\u00e9tropolitaine, or simply la M\u00e9tropole, a reference to France-in-Europe\nbeing the hub of a global empire \u2014 although these days that consists of little\nmore than a few far-flung islands. Another is l\u2019Hexagone, for the French\nmainland\u2019s vaguely six-sided shape.*\n\nThat much-used geometrical figure of speech contains a more obscure one,\nominously named le Diagonal du vide, or \u201cthe Empty Diagonal.\u201d It echoes the\nname of Arabia\u2019s Empty Quarter (in Arabic: Rub\u2019 al Khali), that corner of the\nArabian Peninsula so devoid of everything but sand that it was used as a\nstand-in for the desert planet of Arrakis in the recent Dune movie.\n\nThere are no sand dunes (or sand worms) in France\u2019s Empty Diagonal, but it is\nso devoid of people that it nevertheless invites comparisons to an actual\ndesert. The Diagonal cuts right across France, from the Meuse department, on\nthe Belgian border in the northeast, to the Landes department in the\nsouthwest, near the Spanish border. Population density in the Diagonal is\ngenerally around or below 30 inhabitants per square km, much lower than the\nFrench average of 119 people/sq km. (By comparison, Paris has 20,386\ninhabitants/sq km.)\n\nHistorically speaking, that demographic imbalance is of fairly recent vintage.\nFrance\u2019s countryside started emptying out around the middle of the 19th\ncentury, prompted by industrialization, urbanization, and low fertility rates.\nThose phenomena hit France earlier than most other European countries. Why? In\na word: Paris. For centuries, the city on the Seine has attracted talent,\ncapital, and people like no other European capital, much to the detriment of\nthe rest of France.\n\nThat at least is the gist of Paris et le d\u00e9sert fran\u00e7ais (1947), the seminal\nwork by geographer Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gravier. He traces the city\u2019s gravitational\npull to the court of Louis XIV. To keep both friends and enemies close, the\nSun King consciously drew in ambitious elites from all over the country to his\nsumptuous residence at Versailles, just outside Paris.\n\nThey came like bees to honey. And they kept coming, even after the French\nRevolution got rid of the monarchy. As radical acolytes of the Enlightenment,\nthe early revolutionaries were wary of the traditionalism of \u201cla province\u201d,\nmuch preferring the hustle and bustle of Paris, the cauldron of modernity.\nFrom Napoleon onward, Paris became the essential showcase of France\u2019s power\nand prestige.\n\nMap of France showing areas of high and low population density (in blue and\ngreen, respectively) and the Empty Diagonal (borders in red). (Credit: Saint-\nYriex-la-Perche blog)\n\nPolitical centralism led to economic concentration, and Paris became one of\nthe world\u2019s great destinations of migration, albeit initially mostly from\nwithin France itself. In 1920, just 39% of its inhabitants were native to the\ncity. Half were immigrants from the French countryside, with another 10%\ncoming from outside France\u2019s borders. (See Strange Maps #360).\n\nGravier was not a fan. Since 1850, he said, \u201cthe urban agglomeration of Paris\nhas behaved not as a metropolis invigorating its hinterland, but as a\nmonopolist, consuming the essence of the nation.\u201d Because of the capital\u2019s\nmuch lower fertility rate, Paris was \u201can urban monster, depriving France each\nyear of three times as much human capital as alcoholism.\u201d\n\nEven back then, the geographer displayed a cultural pessimism that would fit\nright in with today\u2019s prophets of doom: \u201cAs Poles, Italians, and Spaniards\ncome to replace the children that the French themselves didn\u2019t want to have,\nsome will inevitably be reminded of the Late Roman Empire, slowly being\ninvaded by the Barbarians.\u201d\n\nTainted by participation in right-wing fringe organizations before WWII and\ncollaboration during the war, Gravier was no stranger to controversy. Yet the\nessence of his \u201cruralist\u201d message resonated with public opinion in post-war\nFrance and informed several attempts in the second half of the 20^th century\nto decentralize the French state and reverse the effect of the capital\u2019s fatal\nattraction on the rest of the country.\n\nIt is fair to say that those attempts have not quite succeeded. In fact, the\nterm Diagonal du vide gained popularity as recently as the 1990s, as a more\nprecise successor to Gravier\u2019s \u201cFrench desert.\u201d Despite the fact that the\nEmpty Diagonal does contain some centers with growth potential, notably cities\nsuch as Toulouse or Clermont-Ferrand, the general trend still is one of\npopulation decline. Some areas have more deaths than births, others more\npeople leaving than arriving. And in some, it\u2019s both.\n\nFormerly buzzing with industry, entire regions in northeast France are\nemptying out. Factory closures over the last half century have reduced\nindustry and opportunity, increased unemployment and poverty, and fuelled\noutward migration. And it\u2019s not just northern industry that is on the wane.\nOver the past 40 years, the number of French people employed in agriculture\nhas declined from 1.6 million to 400,000.\n\nSubscribe for counterintuitive, surprising, and impactful stories delivered to\nyour inbox every Thursday\n\nThe effect is being felt in towns and villages throughout the Diagonal. In\nsome places, the decline is exponential rather than linear. As populations age\nand shrink, communities lose services like schools, caf\u00e9s, bakeries, and shops\n\u2014 which in turn accelerates the decline.\n\nThe emptiness of the Diagonal continues on the other side of the Pyrenees,\ntaking in much of the Iberian peninsula. (Credit: EU NUTS 2 Population Density\n2007 by Ecelan / Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nThe Empty Diagonal is by no means the only part of rural France suffering from\npopulation decline. Other empty(ing) zones outside the Diagonal can be found\nnear the Alps in the southeast and the Pyrenees in the south, among others.\nZooming out, the Diagonal is part of a larger area of inland Europe suffering\nfrom seemingly interminable decline, extending to much of the Iberian\npeninsula, including the larger parts of both Spain and Portugal.\n\nHowever, a label as pithy as the \u201cEmpty Diagonal\u201d is so powerfully descriptive\nthat it risks becoming prescriptive. The solution? Give the area another name.\nBecause of the label\u2019s negative connotations, some now prefer to call the\ndesert at the heart of France la Diagonale des faibles densit\u00e9s: the \u201cLow-\ndensity Diagonal.\u201d There, problem solved!\n\nStrange Maps #1122\n\nGot a strange map?
