Here\u2019s\nwhy that shouldn\u2019t surprise you\n\nJames Bridle\n\nThis is how these bosses get rich: by hiding underpaid, unrecognised human\nwork behind the trappings of technology\n\nShare\n\nIn 2021, when Amazon launched its first \u201cjust walk out\u201d grocery store in the\nUK in Ealing, west London, this newspaper reported on the cutting-edge\ntechnologies that Amazon said made it all possible: facial-recognition\ncameras, sensors on the shelves and, of course, \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d. The\nfirst customers queued outside, excited to experience the future. \u201cI am an\nearly adopter,\u201d one of them said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see how this new technology\nworks and I think it is going to be everywhere shortly.\u201d\n\nThe promise of the \u201cjust walk out\u201d stores was that customers would not need to\nqueue for a cashier, scan their own items or even pause on the way out. They\ncould simply take what they needed, walk out the door and the benevolent all-\nseeing eye of technology would seamlessly price their goods, charge their\naccount and send them a receipt.\n\nThe reality was that people were watching Amazon\u2019s customers shop. More than a\nthousand of them, as reported by The Information, watching the cameras and\nlabelling footage of shoppers. An employee who worked on the technology said\nthat actual humans \u2013 albeit distant and invisible ones, based in India \u2013\nreviewed about 70% of sales made in the \u201ccashier-less\u201d shops as of mid-2022\n(Amazon responded that \u201cthe characterisation of the role and number of human\nreviewers is not accurate\u201d). Now, Amazon is reportedly moving away from \u201cjust\nwalk out\u201d and rolling out \u201csmart shopping carts\u201d instead (AKA a scanner in\nyour trolley \u2013 big whoop).\n\nI can\u2019t stress enough how little of a surprise this should be. First, the fake\nrobot shtick is very, very old. It goes back at least to 1770, and the\noriginal \u201cMechanical Turk\u201d, a chess-playing robot that wowed the courts of\nEurope for decades until being revealed that it was, in fact, a series of\ngrandmasters hiding in a box. Recent updates include Facebook\u2019s \u201csmart\nassistant\u201d, M, which claimed to be AI but referred any complex queries to\npeople; and Cruise, the self-driving car company whose operations required\nremote workers to intervene every two-and-a-half to five miles.\n\nAll of these are, separately, quite funny stories. But collectively they paint\na picture of a society, and a culture, utterly unequipped to register the\nviolence that is being done to it, merely because historical process is draped\nin the ribbons of \u201ctechnology\u201d. This violence is enacted simultaneously on the\nhigh street and the global stage. What makes me angry about how often we keep\nfalling for it is not merely that we should know better, but what the costs of\ndoing so actually are.\n\nThe national minimum wage in the UK is \u00a311.44. A small grocery store like the\nAmazon Fresh shops might have half a dozen staff. Assuming all of them were on\nfull wage (unlikely) and all of them were on the lowest wage (ie not\nmanagers), the average individual salary would be about \u00a320k and the annual\nwage bill would be about \u00a3130k. When this work is outsourced via video\ncameras, it is passed to data labellers. Amazon\u2019s remote data labellers might\nbe paid one or two pounds an hour, if they are lucky. If you can replace half\na dozen UK staff with half a dozen data labellers in India, Kenya or the\nPhilippines, then the difference in the annual staff bill alone could be\nalmost \u00a3100,000 a year.\n\nJeff Bezos is the second-wealthiest person in the world, worth about $205bn\n(\u00a3163bn). That money doesn\u2019t come out of nowhere. It doesn\u2019t drop out of a\npier-end slot machine called, \u201cI learned to code at Princeton and that\u2019s why\nI\u2019m better than you\u201d. It is the result of deliberately hiding actual work \u2013\ndesigning, making, sorting, packing, cooking, farming, delivering \u2013 behind\nlittle icons on your smartphone screen, in order to devalue it. It is the\nsystematic use of the fake robot trick to lower the value of labour, until\npeople are reportedly sleeping in tents at the factory gates, then banking the\ndifference.\n\nAI could be an extraordinary force for good. So why do our politicians still not have a plan? | Gaby Hinsliff\n\nRead more\n\nThe size of Bezos\u2019s rocket is very precisely determined by the difference in\ncosts between paying a worker in Britain and a worker in India \u2013 including all\nthe historically determined racist and colonialist inequality that calculation\ninvolves. But make no mistake \u2013 Bezos and his ilk will pay a robot even less,\nas soon as that\u2019s possible. The only lesson of Amazon Fresh is that we are not\n\u2013 quite \u2013 there yet.\n\nThe fake robot shtick has another purpose too: it\u2019s a distraction. In 2021,\nAmazon and Google jointly signed a $1.2 billion contract to provide the\nIsraeli state, including the military, with cloud computing and AI systems.\nWhile there\u2019s no evidence that Google or Amazon\u2019s technology has been used in\nkillings of civilians, this continuing deal displays a willingness to engage\nwith a military that has killed 30,000 people, and whose use of \u201cAI\u201d-powered\ntargeting allows it to say: \u201cThe machine did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust walk out\u201d might have had its day, but the elision of consumer comfort\nand plausible deniability is alive and well on the high street. Tesco opened\nits first GetGo store in 2021, promising the same kind of checkout-free\nconvenience as \u201cjust walk out\u201d \u2013 they now operate stores in London, Birmingham\nand Welwyn Garden City. Tesco boasts that instead of using facial recognition,\nGetGo creates \u201cskeleton outlines\u201d of you. The underlying technology for the\nservice is provided by Trigo, an Israeli company that boasts that almost all\nof its engineers were \u201ccherry-picked from elite military units\u201d including Unit\n8200, the IDF\u2019s military surveillance agency, and Unit 9900, its specialist\nsurveillance and mapping division. Point-to-point tracking of unknown bodies\nthrough built-up space, based on algorithmic analysis of gait and posture? I\nwonder where they learned to do that.\n\n  * James Bridle is a writer and artist, and the author of Ways of Being: Beyond Human Intelligence\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Artificial intelligence (AI)\n  * Opinion\n  * Amazon\n  * Retail industry\n  * Internet\n  * comment\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Business\n  * Economics\n  * Banking\n  * Money\n  * Markets\n  * Project Syndicate\n  * B2B\n  * Retail\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
