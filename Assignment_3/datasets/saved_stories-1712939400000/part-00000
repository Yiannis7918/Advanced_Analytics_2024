another 277,000 borrowers.\n  * After the Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden\u2019s wide-scale debt cancellation plan, the president directed the U.S. Department of Education to examine its

$153 billion in aid, while Biden has been in office.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden speaks about student loan debt forgiveness in the\nRoosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 24, 2022.\n\nEvan Vucci | AP\n\nThe Biden administration announced Friday that it will forgive $7.4 billion in\nstudent debt for 277,000 borrowers.\n\nThe latest round of loan cancellations is a result of the U.S. Department of\nEducation\u2019s recent changes and improved oversight of income-driven repayment\nplans and the popular Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\n\u201cAs long as there are people with overwhelming student loan debt competing\nwith basic needs such as food and healthcare, we will remain relentless in our\npursuit to bring relief to millions across the country,\u201d U.S. Secretary of\nEducation Miguel Cardona said in a statement.\n\nMore from Personal Finance: Cash savers still have an opportunity to beat\ninflation Should you refinance your mortgage? Here\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with\nTikTok\u2019s viral savings challenges\n\n## Here is who benefits from this round of forgiveness\n\nIn this round of forgiveness, more than 206,000 borrowers will collectively\nget $3.6 billion in debt erased through the Biden administration\u2019s new Saving\non a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, due to the provision that allows for\ndebt forgiveness after shorter periods than other income-driven repayment\nplans for those who originally took out small amounts for college.\n\nMore than 65,000 borrowers will have their loans canceled through fixes to the\nDepartment of Education\u2019s income-driven repayment plans, and 4,600 borrowers\nare benefiting from the improvements to the government\u2019s loan forgiveness\nprogram for public servants. Aid for these groups in this round of forgiveness\namounts to $3.5 billion and $300 million, respectively.\n\nBiden\u2019s 2020 campaign promise to erase student debt was thwarted at the\nSupreme Court last June. The conservative justices ruled that Biden\u2019s $400\nbillion loan cancellation plan was unconstitutional.\n\nAfter that, the president directed the Department of Education to examine its\nexisting authority to reduce and eliminate students\u2019 debts. Mainly by\nimproving current loan relief programs, the department has cleared the federal\neducation loans of 4.3 million people, totaling $153 billion in aid, while\nBiden has been in office.\n\nThe president also rolled out his wide-scale student loan forgiveness do-over\nplan earlier this week.\n\nThis is breaking news.
