How do you kick the habit?\n\nStephen Moss\n\nSun 12 Jan 2020 17.00 CET\n\nShare\n\nSugar is bad; sugar is evil; sugar is the devil. We all know that, although\nthat doesn\u2019t stop us from heaping it over our Weetabix every morning and\nadding it to tea and coffee.\n\nToo much sugar can lead to weight gain, causes tooth decay and increases the\nrisk of diabetes. But it also has another profound effect \u2013 it messes with\nyour sleep, and in such a way that your sleeplessness will leave you with a\ncraving for more sugar.\n\nA 2016 study found that people who have diets high in sugar tend to sleep less\ndeeply and display greater restlessness at night. According to Dr Michael\nBreus \u2013 AKA \u201cthe sleep doctor\u201d \u2013 a US clinical psychologist who specialises in\nsleep disorders, too much sugar leads to a tendency to eat later in the day\nbecause blood sugar levels are zigzagging out of control. That adversely\naffects sleep, and your disrupted sleep will, in turn, produce an even greater\ncraving for sugar the next day. The vicious circle is complete.\n\nHaving too much sugar at night can be detrimental to our health. \u201cWhen you eat\nsugar, your blood sugar levels rise and your pancreas releases insulin, which\nhelps the sugar to be taken back into the cells, giving them fuel to run on,\u201d\nsays the dietitian Alex Evans. \u201cEating sugar late at night overstimulates you.\nIt gives you energy and makes you ready for activity, but that is not what\nwe\u2019re trying to do at night. We\u2019re designed to shut down towards the end of\nthe day.\u201d\n\n\u201cSugar uses up a lot of magnesium, which you need for sleep,\u201d says the\nnutritional therapist Charlotte Watts, author of Good Mood Food and The De-\nStress Effect. She points out that you should, in particular, avoid late-night\nchocolate, which contains caffeine and other stimulants.\n\nDr Paul Kelley, a researcher into sleep patterns, accepts the link between\nhigh sugar intake and disturbed sleep, but cautions that more data is needed\nbefore we fully understand the causality. \u201cPoor sleep and eating sugar and\nfatty foods do go together, but there is evidence on both sides about which\ndirection it goes in,\u201d he says. \u201cDoes eating sweet things make you sleep less\nor does sleeping less make you eat sweet things?\u201d\n\n> The less you rely on sugar during the day, the more you are able to achieve\n> healthy sleep patterns at night\n\nHe says the average adult needs at least seven hours sleep a night; any less\nand you will be looking for short-term energy boosts, and the combination of\nbad diet and poor sleep will damage your health.\n\n\u201cWe have a major problem with sleep and a major problem with food, and they\ninteract,\u201d says Kelley. \u201cSugary foods are likely to disrupt your sleep. The\nrule of thumb is that you shouldn\u2019t eat in the two hours before you go to\nsleep.\u201d He recommends avoiding caffeine and switching off the TV an hour\nbefore bed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real biochemical drive to eat more sugar,\u201d says Watts. \u201cThe body\nrecognises that resources are low, and you need something that acts as a\ncrutch.\u201d She says bingeing on sugary foods can be a sign of loneliness. \u201cWhen\nwe don\u2019t have enough joy in life, we tend to turn to things that can prop us\nup instead, and sugar is one of those. Sugar is a massive self-medicator.\u201d\n\nThe encouraging news is that the craving can be broken. \u201cBlood sugar is like a\nrollercoaster, but fibrous foods such as wholemeal and granary bread, and\npotatoes in their skins can help to control it,\u201d says the dietitian Anna\nHardman. \u201cThey release sugar over a much longer period and reduce the spikes.\u201d\nYour overworked pancreas gets a well-earned rest.\n\nFoods high in tryptophan are recommended for enhancing sleep. These include\nbeans, lentils, nuts, whole grains and poultry. Or you could opt for a meal\nwith sleep-inducing carbs and some protein. \u201cTryptophan helps to make the\nneurotransmitter serotonin, known as the \u2018happy hormone\u2019,\u201d says Evans. \u201cOne of\nthe things it does is prepare you for sleep.\u201d\n\nSo what should those who have late-night food cravings eat? \u201cGood sources of\ntryptophan are cottage cheese and turkey,\u201d she says. \u201cCertain plants are seen\nto have a sleepy effect \u2013 lettuce, for example. A turkey and lettuce sandwich\non wholegrain bread would give you slow-release carbohydrates from the bread,\ntryptophan from the turkey, producing your serotonin, and the soporific effect\nfrom the lettuce.\u201d\n\nWatts recommends eating well throughout the day, starting with plenty of\nprotein for breakfast, to counteract fluctuating blood-sugar levels. \u201cThe less\nyou rely on sugar and caffeine to prop you up through the day, the more you\nare able to go into healthy sleep patterns at night,\u201d she says.\n\nHealthy eating, exercise and an evening wind-down produce good sleep, and the\nvicious circle turns virtuous.
