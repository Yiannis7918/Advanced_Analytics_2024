Built\noverlooking the Atlantic Ocean in the Ouakam suburb, the statue was designed\nby the Senegalese architect Pierre Goudiaby after an idea presented by\npresident Abdoulaye Wade and built by Mansudae Overseas Projects, a company\nfrom North Korea.^[1]\n\nSite preparation on top of the 100-meter high hill began in 2006, and\nconstruction of the bronze statue began 2008.^[2] Originally scheduled for\ncompletion in December 2009, delays stretched into early 2010, and the formal\ndedication occurred on 4 April 2010, Senegal's \"National Day\", commemorating\nthe 50th anniversary of the country's independence from France.^[3] It is the\ntallest statue in Africa.\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\nThe project was launched by then Senegalese president Abdoulaye Wade who\nconsidered it part of Senegal's prestige projects, aimed at providing\nmonuments to herald a new era of African Renaissance. It shows a family drawn\nup towards the sky, the man carrying his child on his biceps and holding his\nwife by the waist, \"an Africa emerging from the bowels of the earth, leaving\nobscurantism to go towards the light\". The monument indeed represents an\nAfrican family resolutely turned towards the North-West.^[citation needed] The\nproject of the monument was entrusted to the Senegalese architect Pierre\nGoudiaby Atepa, author \"in particular\" of the Door of the Third Millennium\nwhich overhangs the road of the Corniche. The work was \"drawn\" by President\nWade who owns 35% of the copyright, but the work was initiated by the famous\nSenegalese artist Ousmane Sow who withdrew from the project following a\ndisagreement with Abdoulaye Wade.^[citation needed]\n\n## Unveiling[edit]\n\nOn 3 April 2010, the African Renaissance Monument was unveiled in Dakar in\nfront of 19 African heads of state, including President of Malawi and the\nAfrican Union, Bingu wa Mutharika, Jean Ping of the African Union Commission\nand the Presidents of Benin, Cape Verde, Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast,\nThe Gambia, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania and Zimbabwe, as well as representatives\nfrom North Korea, and Jesse Jackson and musician Akon, both from the United\nStates, all of whom were given a tour.^[3]^[4]\n\nPresident Wade said, \"It brings to life our common destiny. Africa has arrived\nin the 21st century standing tall and more ready than ever to take its destiny\ninto its hands.\"^[5] President Bingu said, \"This monument does not belong to\nSenegal. It belongs to the African people wherever we are.\"^[6]\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n### Expense[edit]\n\nThousands of people protested against \"all the failures of President Wade's\nregime, the least of which is this horrible statue\" on the city's streets\nbeforehand, with riot police deployed to maintain control.^[3] Deputy leader\nof the opposition Ndeye Fatou Toure described the monument as an \"economic\nmonster and a financial scandal in the context of the current [economic]\ncrisis\".^[citation needed]\n\nThe colossal statue has been criticized for its cost at US$ 27 million\n(\u00a316.6m).^[1] The payment was made in kind, with 30 to 40 hectares of land\nthat has variously been reported as sponsored by a Senegalese businessman^[7]\nor state-owned land.^[8]\n\n### Style[edit]\n\nThe statue was built by Mansudae Overseas Projects, a North Korean sculpting\ncompany famous for various projects and large statues throughout Africa since\nthe 1970s.^[9]\n\nThe statue was poorly received by art critics around the world after its much-\ndelayed unveiling in 2010 and was compared by some to the (once-abandoned)\nChristopher Columbus statue project that was unveiled in Arecibo, Puerto Rico\nin 2016.^[10] Local imams argued that a statue depicting a human figure is\nidolatrous and objected to the perceived immodesty of the semi-nude male and\nfemale figures.^[11]\n\n### Revenue[edit]\n\nThe project has also attracted controversy due to Wade's claim to the\nintellectual property rights of the statue, and insisting that he is entitled\nto 35 percent of the profits raised.^[11] Opposition figures have sharply\ncriticised Wade's plan to claim intellectual property rights, insisting that\nthe president cannot claim copyright over ideas conceived as a function of his\npublic office.^[1] ^[12]\n\n### Local artists[edit]\n\nOusmane Sow, a world-renowned Senegalese sculptor, also objected to the use of\nforeign builders, saying it was anything but a symbol of African Renaissance\nand nothing to do with art.^[13]\n\n## Gallery of images[edit]\n\n  * Monument as seen from afar, 12 June 2011\n\n  * Buildings in the immediate vicinity of the monument, 6 March 2011\n\n  * Plaques at the base of the statue\n\n## See also[edit]\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to African Renaissance Monument.\n\n  * African Renaissance\n  * Mansudae Overseas Projects\n  * List of tallest statues\n  * Sungbo's Eredo\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c \"Senegal President Wade apologises for Christ comments\".
