Recent high-profile cases include two\nNigerian brothers who pleaded guilty to sexually extorting teen boys and young\nmen in Michigan, including one who took his own life, and a Virginia sheriff\u2019s\ndeputy who sexually extorted and kidnapped a 15-year-old girl.\n\nInstagram and other social media companies have faced growing criticism for\nnot doing enough to protect young people. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of\nInstagram's owner Meta Platforms, apologized to the parents of victims of such\nabuse during a Senate hearing earlier this year.\n\nMeta, which is based in Menlo Park, California, also owns Facebook and\nWhatsApp but the nudity blur feature won\u2019t be added to messages sent on those\nplatforms.\n\nInstagram said scammers often use direct messages to ask for \u201cintimate\nimages.\u201d To counter this, it will soon start testing out a nudity-protection\nfeature for direct messages that blurs any images with nudity \u201cand encourages\npeople to think twice before sending nude images.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe feature is designed not only to protect people from seeing unwanted\nnudity in their DMs, but also to protect them from scammers who may send nude\nimages to trick people into sending their own images in return,\u201d Instagram\nsaid.\n\nThe feature will be turned on by default globally for teens under 18. Adult\nusers will get a notification encouraging them to activate it.\n\nImages with nudity will be blurred with a warning, giving users the option to\nview it. They'll also get an option to block the sender and report the chat.\n\nFor people sending direct messages with nudity, they will get a message\nreminding them to be cautious when sending \u201csensitive photos.\" They'll also be\ninformed that they can unsend the photos if they change their mind, but that\nthere's a chance others may have already seen them.\n\nAs with many of Meta's tools and policies around child safety, critics saw the\nmove as a positive step, but one that does not go far enough.\n\n\u201cI think the tools announced can protect senders, and that is welcome. But\nwhat about recipients?\" said Arturo B\u00e9jar, former engineering director at the\nsocial media giant who is known for his expertise in curbing online\nharassment. He said 1 in 8 teens receives an unwanted advance on Instagram\nevery seven days, citing internal research he compiled while at Meta that he\npresented in November testimony before Congress. \"What tools do they get? What\ncan they do if they get an unwanted nude?\u201d\n\nB\u00e9jar said \u201cthings won\u2019t meaningfully change\u201d until there is a way for a teen\nto say they\u2019ve received an unwanted advance, and there is transparency about\nit.\n\nWhite House assistant press secretary Robyn Patterson also noted Thursday that\nPresident Joe Biden \u201chas been outspoken about his belief that social media\ncompanies can do more to combat sexual exploitation online.\u201d\n\nInstagram said it's working on technology to help identify accounts that could\nbe potentially be engaging in sexual extortion scams, \u201cbased on a range of\nsignals that could indicate sextortion behavior.\u201d\n\nTo stop criminals from connecting with young people, it's also taking measures\nincluding not showing the \u201cmessage\u201d button on a teen\u2019s profile to potential\nsextortion accounts, even if they already follow each other, and testing new\nways to hide teens from these accounts.\n\nIn January, the FBI warned of a \u201chuge increase\u201d in sextortion cases targeting\nchildren \u2014 including financial sextortion, where someone threatens to release\ncompromising images unless the victim pays. The targeted victims are primarily\nboys between the ages of 14 to 17, but the FBI said any child can become a\nvictim. In the six-month period from October 2022 to March 2023, the FBI saw a\nmore than 20% increase in reporting of financially motivated sextortion cases\ninvolving minor victims compared to the same period in the previous year.\n\n__\n\nAP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, California, contributed to\nthis report.\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Technology\n\n## Top Stories\n\n### Washington rule could leave Biden off the November ballot, but state has a\nsolution\n\n  * Apr 12, 5:15 AM\n\n### OJ Simpson, former football star acquitted of murder, dies at 76\n\n  * Apr 11, 10:32 PM\n\n### GOP nominee for NC governor failed to file federal income taxes for 5\nyears\n\n  * Apr 11, 9:05 AM\n\n### Buttigieg visits predominantly Black community following flooding\ninvestigation\n\n  * Apr 11, 6:56 PM\n\n### Mom gives celestial name to baby born during total solar eclipse\n\n  * Apr 9, 4:21 PM\n\n### ABC News Live\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\nABC News Network\n\nAbout Nielsen Measurement\n\nChildren's Online Privacy Policy\n\nContact Us\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\nInterest-Based Ads\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nYour US State Privacy Rights\n\n\u00a9 2024 ABC News\n\n", "frontpage": false}
