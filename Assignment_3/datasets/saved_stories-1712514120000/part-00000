The two spacecraft,\ntraveling in nearly parallel orbits, zipped past each other in opposite\ndirections between March 5 and 6, 2024.\n\nThe dark spot centered in the bottom third of this image is the Korea\nAerospace Research Institute\u2019s Danuri orbiter, smudged because it was\ntraveling quickly in the opposite direction of NASA\u2019s LRO (Lunar\nReconnaissance Orbiter) when LRO snapped the photo. At the time, Danuri was\norbiting 5 miles, or 8 kilometers, below LRO\u2019s orbit, and LRO was about 50\nmiles, or 80 kilometers, above the Moon\u2019s surface. This image covers an area\nabout 2 miles, or 3 kilometers, wide.\n\nNASA/Goddard/Arizona State University\n\nLRO\u2019s narrow angle camera (one in a suite of cameras known as \u201cLROC\u201d) captured\nthe images featured here during three orbits that happened to be close enough\nto Danuri\u2019s to grab snapshots.\n\nDue to the fast relative velocities between the two spacecraft (about 7,200\nmiles, or 1,500 kilometers, per hour), the LRO operations team at NASA\u2019s\nGoddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, needed exquisite timing in\npointing LROC to the right place at the right time to catch a glimpse of\nDanuri, the Republic of Korea\u2019s first spacecraft at the Moon. Danuri has been\nin lunar orbit since December 2022. Although LRO\u2019s camera exposure time was\nvery short, only 0.338 milliseconds, Danuri still appears smeared to 10 times\nits size in the opposite direction of travel because of the relative high\ntravel velocities between the two spacecraft.\n\nAt the first imaging opportunity, LRO was oriented down 43 degrees from its\ntypical position of looking down at the lunar surface to capture Danuri\n(streaked across the middle) from 3 miles, or 5 kilometers, above it.\n\nNASA/Goddard/Arizona State University\n\nDuring the next encounter, LRO was closer to Danuri, about 2.5 miles, or 4\nkilometers, and oriented 25 degrees toward it.\n\nNASA/Goddard/Arizona State University\n\nFor the final photo, LRO was reoriented by 60 degrees to catch a glimpse of\nDanuri when it was 5 miles, or 8 kilometers, below it. This image pair was\ncorrected for viewing geometry, and, on the right, the Danuri pixels were\nunsmeared and the image stretched to highlight the Korean spacecraft. The\nimage was rotated 90 degrees so the surface would look like something a person\nwould see looking out the window.\n\nNASA/Goddard/Arizona State University\n\nThis image shows Danuri in the white box near the right-hand corner of the\nimage. The large bowl-shaped crater visible in the upper left is 7.5 miles, or\n12 kilometers, wide.\n\nNASA/Goddard/Arizona State University\n\nLast spring, Danuri had an opportunity to photograph LRO. Its ShadowCam\ninstrument, provided by NASA, snapped this photo of LRO as the Korean\nspacecraft passed about 11 miles (18 kilometers) above it on April 7, 2023.\nBased on the design of LRO\u2019s narrow angle cameras, the ShadowCam was built to\ntake high-resolution images of the Moon\u2019s permanently shadowed regions, where\nfrozen water is likely trapped. The relative velocity between the two\nspacecraft was about 7,000 miles, or 11,000 kilometers, per hour.\n\nNASA/KARI/Arizona State University\n\nLRO is managed by NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland,\nfor the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nLaunched on June 18, 2009, LRO has collected a treasure trove of data with its\nseven powerful instruments, making an invaluable contribution to our knowledge\nabout the Moon. NASA is returning to the Moon with commercial and\ninternational partners to expand human presence in space and bring back new\nknowledge and opportunities.\n\nMore on this story from Arizona State University\u2019s LRO Camera website\n\nBy Mark Robinson, Arizona State University, Tempe, and Lonnie Shekhtman,\nNASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.\n\nMedia Contact: Nancy N.
