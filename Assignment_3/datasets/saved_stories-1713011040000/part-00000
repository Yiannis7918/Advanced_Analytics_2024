The\ncampaign group Smartphone Free Childhood said the move \u201cflies in the face of\nthe growing national demand for big tech to do more to protect our children\u201d.\n\nIt said: \u201cOfficially allowing anyone over the age of 12 to use their platform\n(the minimum age was 16 before today) sends a message that it\u2019s safe for\nchildren. But teachers, parents and experts tell a very different story. As a\ncommunity we\u2019re fed up with the tech giants putting their shareholder profits\nbefore protecting our children.\u201d\n\nWhatsApp said the change brought the age limit in line with that in the\nmajority of countries, and that protections were in place.\n\nOfcom\u2019s director of online safety strategy, Mark Bunting, said the regulator\nwould not hesitate to fine social media companies that failed to follow its\ndirections, once it had the power to do so.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that Ofcom was writing codes of practice\nfor enforcing online safety. \u201cSo when our powers come into force next year,\nwe\u2019ll be able to hold them to account for the effectiveness of what they\u2019re\ndoing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re not taking those steps at that point, and they can\u2019t demonstrate\nto us that they\u2019re taking alternative steps which are effective at keeping\nchildren safe, then we will be able to investigate. We have powers to direct\nthem to make changes, if we believe changes are necessary to make.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t comply with those directions, we do have powers to levy fines \u2013\nand we won\u2019t hesitate to use those powers \u2013 if there\u2019s no other way of driving\nthe change that we think is needed.\u201d\n\nThis week Meta, which also owns Facebook and Instagram, unveiled a range of\nsafety features designed to protect users, in particular young people, from\n\u201csextortion\u201d and intimate image abuse.\n\nIt confirmed it would begin testing a filter called Nudity Protection in\ndirect messages on Instagram, which will be switched on by default for users\nunder the age of 18 and will automatically blur images sent to users that are\ndetected as containing nudity.\n\nWhen receiving nude images, users will also see a message urging them not to\nfeel pressure to respond, and an option to block the sender and report the\nchat.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Meta\n  * Internet safety\n  * European Union\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Facebook and Instagram: Meta services hit by widespread outages\n\n5 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Violent online content \u2018unavoidable\u2019 for UK children, Ofcom finds\n\n15 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Facebook rules allow altered video casting Biden as paedophile, says board\n\n5 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Banning phones in England\u2019s schools will not address online safety, say campaigners\n\n19 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Mark Zuckerberg to receive $700m from Meta dividends\n\n2 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Social media algorithms \u2018amplifying misogynistic content\u2019\n\n6 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Rishi Sunak considers curbing social media use for under-16s\n\n14 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### Meta revenue soars as it pivots to AI and announces dividends for investors\n\n1 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### UK ministers seek to allay WhatsApp and Signal concerns in encryption row\n\n6 Sept 2023\n\n  * ### Zuckerberg tells parents of social media victims at Senate hearing: \u2018I\u2019m sorry for everything you\u2019ve been through\u2019\n\n31 Jan 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
