For example, it\nhas dependent types and refinement types. These types strongly encode pre-\nconditions, invariant conditions, etc. into the code.\n\n## Simplicity & Consistency\n\nErg consists of a very simple and consistent syntax, which can significantly\nreduce the amount of code compared to other languages. However, its\nfunctionality is not inferior to them. Since the type inference system is\npowerful, you can code like a dynamically typed language.\n\n## Readability\n\nIn addition to the readability of the syntax itself, Erg defines a rich set of\nmethods and functions by default to improve code readability.\n\n## Multi Paradigm\n\nFunctional & Object-Oriented\n\n## Maintainability\n\nErg requires some kinds of markers to be placed on code that causes side\neffects or changes internal state, which can localize the complexity of code.\nThis will greatly improve the maintainability of your code.\n\n## Programmer Friendly\n\nErg is committed to providing error messages that are easy to read and various\ndevelopment tools. Erg also provide multilingual support for error messages,\netc.\n\n## Interoperability with Python\n\nErg code can be compiled into Python bytecode. This means you have zero-cost\naccess to your Python assets with Erg.\n\n## Multiple Backends\n\n  * CPython\n  * WIP Rust (The compiler is called Gal, also optimized to Erg's specifications)\n  * WIP Dyne (Python compatible bytecode interpreter, optimized to Erg's specifications, static types and the ownership system etc.)\n\nMaintained by the Erg Team\n\n", "frontpage": false}
