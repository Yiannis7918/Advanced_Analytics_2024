A powerful water cannon can attack targets over 100\nmetres (328 feet) away, generating a pressure of more than 1.2 megapascals. An\nadult male facing that head-on could be subjected to an impact force of nearly\nnine tonnes, equivalent to being stepped on by an African elephant.\n\nIn recent months, Philippine ships have frequently been hit by water cannons\nduring stand-offs with Chinese coastguard vessels. In one notable incident\nlast month, a cockpit windscreen was shattered, injuring several personnel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn another clash at Second Thomas Shoal, known as Renai Reef in China and\nAyungin Shoal in the Philippines, crew members of a Philippine supply ship\nwaved a white flag due to the relentless barrage of the weapons.\n\nHowever, based on videos released by both sides, the accuracy of these weapons\nleaves much to be desired, often missing their mark in rough seas.\n\n04:30\n\nPhilippines sets up \u2018game changer\u2019 monitoring station on island in disputed\nSouth China Sea\n\nPhilippines sets up \u2018game changer\u2019 monitoring station on island in disputed\nSouth China Sea\n\nIt is a problem the smart water cannon aims to address. Developed by the Wuhan\nMarine Electric Propulsion Device Research Institute, it can automatically\nidentify targets and adjust its power and jet trajectory based on real-time\nfeedback from a photoelectric camera.\n\nDaily, Monday to Friday\n\nChina at a Glance Newsletter\n\nYour daily must-read of essential stories from China, including politics,\neconomy and current affairs.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

China is\ncurrently developing a \u2018smart\u2019 weapon that will have better accuracy.

Since then, the\ntechnology has remained more or less the same due to its limited range of\napplications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina has been vigorously developing its maritime forces in recent decades,\nincluding electromagnetic catapult aircraft carriers, hypersonic anti-ship\nmissiles, ultra-high-power electronic warfare systems and other cutting-edge\nequipment.\n\nThey are formidable weapons, aimed squarely at the US military, but they are\ntoo much for territorial disputes against smaller Southeast Asian nations in\nthe South China Sea.\n\nThe vast disparity in military strength renders China\u2019s hi-tech arsenal\nimpractical against these neighbours. For instance, the Philippines\u2019 entire\nnaval force owns only two frigates capable of launching missiles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecognising this imbalance, the Chinese government has ramped up investment in\nwater cannon technology, developing a range of increasingly automated and\npowerful products.\n\nThe technology has also been aided from an unlikely quarter \u2013 China\u2019s\ninfrastructure projects. With large-scale land reclamation and other\ninfrastructure projects under way, China has some of the world\u2019s most powerful\ndredging vessels that suck seabed sediment to redistribute it to designated\nareas. The water pump technology involved in that process is perfectly suited\nto driving high-performance water cannons.\n\nIn 2022, China officially listed a water cannon with a range exceeding 100\nmetres in its export control catalogue, strengthening its dominant position in\nthe use of the weapon.\n\nSo far, in South China Sea disputes, only China has used water cannons; the\nPhilippines has not used any in retaliation.\n\n01:49\n\nChinese floating barrier blocks entrance to Philippine ships at South China\nSea flashpoint\n\nChinese floating barrier blocks entrance to Philippine ships at South China\nSea flashpoint\n\nZhang Yuqiang, a researcher with the People\u2019s Armed Police Maritime Police\nAcademy Command Department, said that shipboard non-lethal weapons including\nwater cannons \u201cwill play an increasingly important role in future maritime\nconflicts\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, competition and struggles around marine interests and power\nhave become increasingly fierce, and maritime disputes have become a common\nchallenge faced by most maritime countries in the world,\u201d Zhang and his\ncolleagues wrote in a paper published in the journal China Equipment\nEngineering in February.\n\nBecause all sides are \u201cfighting for every inch of land and refusing to cede an\ninch\u201d, the team said, using traditional lethal weapons in small-scale\nskirmishes could cause them escalate into large-scale armed conflicts. It is a\nsituation that neither China nor other countries around the South China Sea\nwish to see.\n\n\u201cNon-lethal weapons do not directly cause human death, equipment destruction\nand ecological damage. They only use specific technical means to deprive the\nother party\u2019s personnel or equipment of their combat effectiveness, achieving\nthe goal of \u2018subduing the enemy without fighting\u2019,\u201d Zhang\u2019s team wrote.\n\nOther major maritime countries are now stepping up research and deployment of\nother types of non-lethal weapons, including blinding lasers and microwaves\nthat can cause skin-burning sensations, they said.\n\nThere is also a particularly strong interest in infrasound weapons that \u201ccan\ncause dizziness, nausea, dyspnea and even neurological disorders\u201d.\n\n\u201cInfrasound weapons have the characteristics of strong penetration, fast\npropagation speed, good concealment and long-range. In addition to attacking\nships on the ocean surface, they also pose a significant threat to submarines\nin deep seas and will play an essential role in future naval battles,\u201d they\nadded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nListen\n\n130\n\n1\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe use cookies to tailor your experience and present relevant ads.
