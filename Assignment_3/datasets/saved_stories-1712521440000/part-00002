I\u2019ve been sued before, I had...\n>\n> \u2014 Fred Lambert (@FredericLambert) March 13, 2024\n\n\u201cThe feedback loop is completely broken and now Elon is basking in the praise\nof his super fans while branding all legitimate criticism as attacks,\u201d says\nFred Lambert, who has previously spoken about mistakenly putting Musk on a\npedestal.\n\nSpeaking to Fortune, the editor-in-chief for EV motoring website Electrek says\nhis involvement in the community goes back to the days when he volunteered as\na Tesla subreddit moderator.\n\nFor nearly a decade he has run coverage for one of the very first online\npublications devoted to the technology, founded by 9to5Mac creator Seth\nWeintraub.\n\nRecently, Lambert distanced himself from Musk after emails surfaced showing\nthe tycoon had always favored OpenAI becoming a for-profit company\u2014just one\nunder his control and not Microsoft\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHe was always in it for himself,\u201d Lambert wrote at the time, adding \u201cThis is\nnot the man I used to consider my hero.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Fortune, Lambert believes the CEO made a strategic mistake by\nfocusing on the expensive stainless steel Cybertruck at the expense of a\n$25,000 entry model teased at its September 2020 Battery Day, which he\nbelieves would have driven further growth. (Musk appears to now be\nprioritizing a robotaxi following a Reuters report on Friday that he\u2019s put\ndevelopment of the entry model on ice)\n\n> Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8\n>\n> \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 5, 2024\n\nLambert is indicative of a growing schism in the community.\n\nWhile most don\u2019t care how Musk splits his time since they support the man\nfirst\u2014and the company second\u2014an increasingly vocal minority want to see Musk\ncommit himself fully to Tesla\u2019s original mission to decarbonize transport,\nfearing that this plan has been forgotten as the CEO pivots to robotics and\nAI\u2014when he isn\u2019t posting his thoughts on X.\n\n## Musk moves on to robots and AI, forgetting his broken promises\n\nYouTuber Lee of New Zealand has published over 900 videos devoted to the\ncompany under the Tesla Economist account.\n\nHe tells Fortune he became increasingly critical after Musk broke one promise\nafter the other, whether it is the never-ending wait for the Semi, the\nRoadster or the entry model.\n\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment, however, has been the painfully slow\nprogress made with Tesla\u2019s vaunted next-generation 4680 cells and its related\nfailure to reach scale with its innovative dry battery electrode coating, a\ngame changer in terms of capital expenditure and manufacturing cost.\n\n\u201cThe company itself has been going downhill ever since,\u201d he says.\n\nMusk still hasn\u2019t delivered on the second part of his Master Plan, and yet he\nis already predicting Tesla\u2019s future lies in robotics.\n\nMeanwhile, the core car business has faltered and needed a series of price\ncuts just to hit its volume target of 1.8 million vehicles last year.\n\n\u201cI believe he saw this coming and dumped his stock early as a result\u201d Lee\nsays.\n\nHe also criticizes him for popularizing meme cryptocurrency like Dogecoin\namong his followers, knowing he can manipulate the price with a single tweet.\n\nMuch like his promotion of the Shiba Inu-themed digital token, he suspects a\nlot of Musk\u2019s broken promises were little more than an attempt to pump the\nstock to meet the milestone targets of his mammoth (and now void) pay package.\n\n> My take:\n>\n> I had been warning everyone since last year how bad Q1 was looking. As Q1 is\n> always the worst performing Q. Although I didn't expect it quite this bad.\n>\n> It is clearly demand related, whether too much competition, dated Tesla\n> designs, EV market growth slowing, or maybe...\n>\n> \u2014 Tesla Economist (@teslaeconomist) April 3, 2024\n\nNow hope mainly rests on a sudden surge in software revenue from its advanced\ndriver-assist system called supervised Full Self-Driving.\n\n\u201cIt would appear the fate of the company is down to FSD,\u201d said the Tesla\ncontent creator, \u201cand it\u2019s up to you how likely you think that will occur and\nhow much it would be worth\u201d\n\nThis month\u2019s move to drop the \u201cbeta\u201d qualifier in front of FSD in favor of\n\u201csupervised\u201d is seen by many as an attempt to claim testing and validation of\nthe software is over so that it can recognize a chunk of the $926 million in\ndeferred revenue to rescue what will surely be an otherwise challenging Q1 for\nprofits.\n\n## The loss of Tesla\u2019s unflappable finance chief weighs heavy\n\nRoss Gerber, a co-founder of asset manager Gerber Kawasaki, has long been a\nvociferous supporter of Tesla.\n\nYet like many fans of the company\u2019s original mission, he is critical of the\ndebt-funded Twitter acquisition that has sucked up so much of Musk\u2019s time.\n\nGerber put himself forward two years ago as a candidate for Tesla\u2019s board of\ndirectors.\n\nAfter poor Q1 sales\u2014suggesting Musk\u2019s took his eye off the ball to focus on\nservicing the $13 billion in debt he shouldered to buy Twitter\u2014Gerber called\nfor a wholesale boardroom reshuffle with new independent directors.\n\n> For over a year I\u2019ve been warning about this potential reality. Now it\u2019s\n> here. It\u2019s time for shareholders to assess the blame where due. The tesla\n> BOD should be replaced immediately with independent directors as required by\n> law. $tsla\n>\n> \u2014 Ross Gerber (@GerberKawasaki) April 2, 2024\n\nHis reward for stepping out of line is a stream of abuse from Elon superfans.\n\nMusk himself called the money manager this week \u201csuch an idiot that he can\u2019t\neven tell he\u2019s an idiot\u201d.\n\nThe tycoon\u2019s moodiness and volatility, for which he is on a ketamine\nprescription, were less of an issue so long as Tesla\u2019s unflappable finance\nchief, Zach Kirkhorn, was at his side.\n\nLast May, The Wall Street Journal even dubbed him \u201cthe executive who keeps\nTesla rolling\u201d, suggesting Kirkhorn led the field of potential candidates to\nreplace Musk.\n\nThree months later he was suddenly out at the company\u2014no reasons given. Now\nthe board has no clear successor should something happen to Musk.\n\n\u201cZach was a great executive and potential leader. Elon eliminated him,\u201d Gerber\ntells Fortune, \u201cso there is no one to run Tesla other than Elon\u2014no one good\nenough.\u201d\n\n## Call for unity in the increasingly divided fan base\n\nAll three Tesla veterans Fortune spoke to have lost a good chunk of their\nstanding in the Tesla community for warning the EV maker risks falling behind\na competitive field led by China\u2019s BYD.\n\nA new threat in the form of Xiaomi has now also emerged, with the popular\nhandset maker undercutting the Model 3 by thousands of dollars with a sporty\nelectric car that looks suspiciously like the Porsche Taycan EV.\n\nFor now, the various factions are struggling to unite around a common\ndirection for the company: should it stick to freeing the world from the\nclutches of the fossil fuel industry that\u2019s destroying the planet\u2014or build a\nrobot for every man, woman and child?\n\nOmar Qazi, one of the original figures behind the Third Row Tesla podcast and\nan unofficial brand ambassador with access to Musk himself, urged everyone in\nthe community this week to unite behind their CEO.\n\n> Echo chamber warning.\n>\n> \u2014 Gary Black (@garyblack00) April 3, 2024\n\n\u201cElon Musk is the most important asset Tesla has,\u201d he told Schulze and others\nin the forum. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in danger of losing him, in part because a lot of the\nsentiment of shareholders who say we should just kick the guy out, we should\njust fire him.\u201d\n\nMany are tired of hearing old war stories of how Musk would sleep in the\nfactory during the Model 3 ramp six years ago, and would be more content if\nthey knew he showed up every day to run the company like he used to rather\nthan spend his limited time engaging in divisive political issues on X.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my litmus test to determine whether someone is a fan of Tesla or\nElon\u2014do they believe deserves a full-time CEO?\u201d Lambert says. \u201cBut if he\ncannot snap out of this broken feedback loop, I just cannot see him having a\nmore positive than negative impact going forward.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to Data Sheet, our daily newsletter about the business of tech.
