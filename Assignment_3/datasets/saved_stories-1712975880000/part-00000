Released on 11 April\n2024, the game was created by Epic Games, ESA and Hassell, in collaboration\nwith Buendea and Team PWR.\n\nIn Lunar Horizons you play as an astronaut on the Moon's surface, close to its\nSouth Pole. Your mission is to collect resources and use them to build a lunar\nhabitat. The best way to do that is by teaming up with friends in multiplayer\nmode.\n\nESA astronauts Marco Sieber, Pablo Alvarez Fernandez and Rosemary Coogan\nteamed up with John McFall, a member of the ESA Astronaut Reserve, to test\nLunar Horizons.\n\nWith Lunar Horizons you can learn about space while you play. As you explore\nthe lunar landscape and interact with other astronauts, you'll discover\namazing facts about real-life European Moon missions, the wonders of space,\nand the work of ESA.\n\nYou'll even encounter ESA's Argonaut lunar lander, which is being developed\nfor launch on an Ariane 6 rocket for future ESA Moon missions.\n\nESA's Branding and Partnerships Office has been working with a variety of\nvideo game developers to help them add authenticity to games and experiences\nthat explore the infinite wonders of space.\n\nThe developers at Epic Games worked closely with ESA's Human and Robotic\nExploration experts to create a realistic 3D lunar environment for Lunar\nHorizons. This included modelling the Moon's reduced gravity. ESA also\nprovided digital models of the Argonaut.\n\nReflecting on this exciting collaboration, Emmet Fletcher, Head of ESA's\nBranding and Partnerships Office, said, \u201cLunar Horizons provides a fantastic\nopportunity for ESA to reach a huge audience, to tell them about the agency\nand to share with them our passion for space.\u201d\n\nLunar Horizons is available now in Fortnite, where it can be experienced using\ncode 3207-0960-6428 or by searching for \u2018Lunar Horizons\u2019 in Discover.
