In spite of appearances, our plans and consequent\nactions do not originate within us but are the result of the universe acting\nthrough us. We do not have control over our deliberations or even our mind\nstates\u2014in short, no free will.\n\nThe consensus view in modern science is that every event in the universe\u2014from\nthe Big Bang to galaxy and solar system formation, from the evolution of life\nto the thought you are now thinking\u2014is completely dependent either on a set of\ndeterministic laws (including those that govern highly nonlinear and chaotic\nevents like weather and human behavior) or on random chance (arising from\nquantum uncertainty). Marvin Minsky, one of the leading contributors to the\nfield of cognitive science, states in Society of Mind that \u201cWhatever actions\nwe may \u2018choose,\u2019 they cannot make the slightest change in what might otherwise\nhave been, because rigid, natural laws already caused the states of mind that\ncaused us to decide that way.\u201d There are a few physicists, such as Roger\nPenrose, author of Shadows of the Mind, who argue that some new physical law\nis required to explain human consciousness. Yet that still would not appear to\nexplain free will but just add one more law to the existing set of natural\nlaws.\n\nEastern philosophers have also generally held that free will is an illusion.\nThe Taoists have great respect for natural law, advocating Wu Wei, a kind of\nnon-self-oriented action that flows with nature. In Buddhist philosophy the\nquestion of free will does not even arise. As Walpola Rahula points out in\nWhat the Buddha Taught, \u201cIf the whole of existence is relative, conditioned\nand interdependent, how can will alone be free? Will, like any other thought,\nis conditioned. So-called \u2018freedom\u2019 itself is conditioned and relative.\u201d In\nthe Advaita aspect of Vedanta philosophy the \u201cchooser\u201d or \u201cdoer\u201d is considered\nan illusion. Nisargadatta warns in I Am That, \u201cThe very notion of doership, of\nbeing a cause, is bondage.\u201d\n\nIf we accept that free will is an illusion, it raises some serious questions.\nFirst, why do we have such a strong sense that we are the source of our\nconscious, deliberated actions? In his forthcoming book, Rationality in\nAction, philosopher John Searle wonders why, if free will is an illusion, we\nhave evolved this complex and biologically expensive system for conscious,\nrational decision-making. One possible answer is that natural selection has\nplayed an important role. Perhaps early in our evolution those individuals who\nbelieved their actions were self-directed were encouraged to mold the\nenvironment to their benefit. This gave them a survival advantage over others\nwho made no such effort. Even so, these favored individuals were nevertheless\ndriven to act by environmental factors. They had no real free choice; they\njust acquired the mental trait of believing they had free choice.\n\nIn addition to this evolutionary explanation for the illusion of free will,\nthere may be a cultural basis as well. That is, the idea of free will is part\nof the larger human illusion that we are the central focus of all creation.\nConsider the belief held until the early 1600s that the Earth was at the\ncenter of the universe. This belief was challenged by Copernicus, Galileo and\nKepler, who put the sun at the center of our solar system and made our\nobservations of the heavens much easier to explain. Although resisted by some\nat first, this new way of thinking gradually entered into mainstream thought.\n\nTwo hundred fifty years later Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection\nremoved humans from the pedestal of special creation. Nevertheless, many still\nbelieve that humans must occupy a special place in the evolutionary scheme,\nperhaps as the inevitable peak of evolution on Earth.\n\nRecent discoveries suggest we should adopt a more modest view. As explained by\nStephen Jay Gould in Wonderful Life, of the millions of species that evolved\nduring the Cambrian period some 500 million years ago, only a tiny percentage\nstill survive. There appears to be no good reason why the survivors succeeded,\nor why the extinct species failed. As Gould points out, we can think of the\nCambrian period as a lottery; if it were to be held over again, the results\nwould be very different, with the odds being trillions to one against\nvertebrates (and thus humans) evolving a second time. So we can stand in\nwonder that we exist at all and that we have the gift of consciousness to\nappreciate the universe around us.\n\nThe second question raised by accepting the absence of free will deals with\nmoral responsibility. Although biological evolution in humans has not changed\nmuch over the last 50,000 years, cultural evolution has shaped the biological\nimperatives for survival into religious and civil laws. If there is no free\nwill, are these laws meaningless? What happens to good and bad, reward and\npunishment? One answer is that even if we see free will as an illusion, we can\nstill recognize the social requirements for ethics and morals. As Steven\nPinker suggests in How the Mind Works, \u201cFree will is an idealization of human\nbeings that makes the ethics game playable.\u201d The belief that individuals are\nfree rational agents forms the basis for civil laws. Another answer from\nBuddhist and Taoist thought suggests that ethics is not in its essence a set\nof fixed rules or laws; it is our natural behavioral inclination. As Francisco\nVarela writes in his book Ethical Know-How, \u201cThe bodhisattva works without\nmaking any effort, just as the moon illuminates everything impartially.\u201d Or as\nWittgenstein proposes: \u201cEthics and esthetics are one and the same.\u201d\n\nFinally, there is the objection that since we think and act as though we had\nfree will, what difference does it make if free will is an illusion? Won\u2019t the\nend result of our actions be the same? We still deliberate, plan and carry out\nthose plans. The difference here is one of perspective. The planning and\nsubsequent action are not done by \u201cyou\u201d but by the universe acting through\nyou. We are in a play in which we are both actor and audience and there is no\nscript; the play just appears. This may seem depressing at first, but there is\na freedom that comes with letting go of being at the center of the action,\nletting go of being the \u201cdoer.\u201d We realize that with or without free choice we\nwill still experience all the joys and sorrows of living in the world. Our\nconscious experience, our awareness, is not dependent on being \u201cfree\u201d; it just\nis.\n\nIn the end, we can embrace this paradox like a Zen koan: we can live our lives\nas though we have free will yet realize it is just an illusion. This may be\nthe ultimate freedom.\n\n\u221e\n\n##### From the Fall 2001 issue of Inquiring Mind (Vol. 18, No. 1)\n\n##### Text \u00a9 2001 Robert Fraser\n\n##### Photograph: Messages to God: The Western Wall, Jerusalem \u00a9 2001 Alan\nSenauke\n\n## Topics\n\nScience, Ethics, Evolution, Freedom, History, Interdependence, Philosophy,\nQuantum Physics\n\n## Author\n\nRobert Fraser was a Senior Scientist at Foresight Science & Technology, where\nhe worked on the commercialization of new technologies.
