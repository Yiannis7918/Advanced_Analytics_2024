But the only aliens involved in this\nmystery were the ones who sent Ingenuity up to Mars in the first place.\n\nYes, I'm talking about us.\n\nThe helicopter spotted the wreckage on a flight. (NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nThe images show the debris of the landing equipment used when Ingenuity\narrived on Mars with the Perseverance rover back in 2021.\n\nAdvert\n\nIan Clark, an engineer who worked on Perseverance\u2019s parachute system, spoke to\nThe New York Times about the photographs, saying: \u201cThere's definitely a sci-fi\nelement to it. It exudes otherworldly, doesn't it?\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThey say a picture's worth 1,000 words, but it's also worth an\ninfinite amount of engineering understanding.\u201d\n\nThough the photos do admittedly show what a mess we've made up on Mars, they\ncould also be particularly helpful for technicians working on future missions.\n\nThe wreckage could be informative for future missions. (NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nClark explained: \u201cPerseverance had the best-documented Mars landing in\nhistory, with cameras showing everything from parachute inflation to\ntouchdown.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cBut Ingenuity's images offer a different vantage point.\n\n\u201cIf they either reinforce that our systems worked as we think they worked or\nprovide even one dataset of engineering information we can use for Mars Sample\nReturn planning, it will be amazing.\n\n\u201cAnd if not, the pictures are still phenomenal and inspiring.\u201d\n\nTeddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity's team lead at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in\nSouthern California, added: \u201cNASA extended Ingenuity flight operations to\nperform pioneering flights such as this.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cEvery time we're airborne, Ingenuity covers new ground and offers a\nperspective no previous planetary mission could achieve.\u201d\n\nIngenuity's flights over Mars are hoped to help pave the way for future aerial\nexplorers at Mars and potentially even other space destinations.\n\nTopics: Space, NASA, Technology, Science\n\nEmily Brown\n\nEmily Brown is UNILAD Editorial Lead at LADbible Group.
