Since there\nare no natural barriers at its altitude, its flight behaviour is not adapted\nto obstacles standing around in the landscape.\"\n\n## Most read in The Sun\n\nMY HERO\n\n### My dad saved lives during school massacre - they want selfies of me with\ntheir kids\n\nBUCK THE TREND\n\n### Popular chain restaurant announces 'most' of their locations will close\ndown\n\nFAMILY HORROR\n\n### Mother reveals chilling details after son 'drowned dad' in 'exorcism'\nkilling\n\nDEADLY STRIKE\n\n### Hamas chief killed in Israel strike as IDF prepare to wipe out terror\ngroup\n\nHowever, the operating company claims the production of such wind turbines\ncould greatly help with the country's power consumption as one single turbine\ncould supply 8,000 households with energy.\n\nIt also says that the new structures could be added to existing wind farms,\nslotting in between shorter turbines.\n\nBIGGEST BEN Holiday hotspot Dubai to build the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper\nCLOCK dubbed London Gate in nod to Big Ben\n\n\u201cThe masts are so high that the rotors do not overlap and take the wind away\nfrom each other,\u201d Grossmann explained.\n\nGermany's tallest wind turbine is expected to be built by the end of this year\nand will be a distinct, cage-like design, unlike anything that exists today.\n\nAnd the company plans to erect 1,000 such giant turbines across Germany, with\na particular focus on the state of Bavaria.\n\nIn 2017, Germany was home to the world's largest wind turbine of the time.\n\nBuilt by B\u00f6gl Wind AG, the central hub of the structure measured 808ft\nincluding the rotor blades.\n\nCurrently, the world's tallest wind turbine stands at 919ft in Denmark.\n\nConsidered to be the most powerful wind energy generator, the Vestas V236-15.0\nMW has a wind-swept area of 470,845 square feet.\n\nIt comes as Dubai is getting ready to build the world's tallest residential\nclock tower in a nod to London's Big Ben.\n\nThe immense building will stand at a staggering 450 metres high (1,476ft) -\nalmost five times higher than its 96-metre British counterpart.\n\nAeternitas Tower, dubbed 'London Gate', will be the child product of Dubai-\nbased real estate developer London Gate and Swiss luxury watch manufacturer\nFranck Muller.\n\nThe sky-high tower will have a glistening all-glass facade with an enormous\nclock at the very top.\n\nMeasuring 40 metres tall by 30 metres wide, the clock will be built in Germany\nand be visible from miles away.\n\nFollowing the Swiss watchmaker's art-deco style, the clock will feature\nirregular squashed and stretched numbers.\n\n5\n\nGermany plans to erect thousands of such wind turbines across the\ncountryCredit: YouTube\n\n## Read More on The US Sun\n\nDAMAGE IS DONE\n\n### Girl, 13, suffers lasting brain damage after food from 'putrid' Wendy's\n\nGLO NO!\n\n### GloRilla arrested for DUI and suffers wardrobe malfunction during sobriety\ntest\n\nTopics\n\n  * Energy bills\n  * Germany\n\nNEW STORIES ON THE SUN\n\nYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\nRECOMMENDED FOR YOU\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n### More from The Sun\n\nMY HERO\n\n### My dad saved lives during school massacre - they want selfies of me with\ntheir kids\n\nBUCK THE TREND\n\n### Popular chain restaurant announces 'most' of their locations will close\ndown\n\nFAMILY HORROR\n\n### Mother reveals chilling details after son 'drowned dad' in 'exorcism'\nkilling\n\nDEADLY STRIKE\n\n### Hamas chief killed in Israel strike as IDF prepare to wipe out terror\ngroup\n\n### Follow The Sun\n\n### Services\n\n  * Sign Up To The Sun\n  * About Us\n  * Editorial Complaints\n  * Editorial Standards, Policies and Ethics\n  * News Licensing\n  * Advertising\n  * Contact Us\n  * Help Hub\n  * Topic A-Z\n  * Cookie Settings\n  * Contact Preferences\n  * Sun Jobs\n  * Shopping\n\n\u00a9 2020 THE SUN, US, INC.
