Here the organization shares what\nit found\n\n  * What\u2019s safe to eat? Here is the pesticide risk level for each fruit and vegetable\n\nSupported by\n\nAbout this content\n\nCatherine Roberts of Consumer Reports, with graphics by Aliya Uteuova\n\nShare\n\nWhen it comes to healthy eating, fruits and vegetables reign supreme. But\nalong with all their vitamins, minerals and other nutrients can come something\nelse: an unhealthy dose of dangerous pesticides.\n\nBlueberries and bell peppers: six fruits and vegetables with the most\npesticide risk\n\nRead more\n\nThough using chemicals to control bugs, fungi and weeds helps farmers grow the\nfood we need, it\u2019s been clear since at least the 1960s that some chemicals\nalso carry unacceptable health risks. And although certain notorious\npesticides, such as DDT, have been banned in the US, government regulators\nhave been slow to act on others. Even when a dangerous chemical is removed\nfrom the market, chemical companies and growers sometimes just start using\nother options that may be as dangerous.\n\nConsumer Reports, which has tracked the use of pesticides on produce for\ndecades, has seen this pattern repeat itself over and over. \u201cIt\u2019s two steps\nforward and one step back \u2013 and sometimes even two steps back,\u201d says James E\nRogers, who oversees food safety at Consumer Reports.\n\nTo get a sense of the current situation, Consumer Reports recently conducted\nour most comprehensive review ever of pesticides in food. To do it, we\nanalyzed seven years of data from the US Department of Agriculture, which each\nyear tests a selection of conventional and organic produce grown in or\nimported to the US for pesticide residues. We looked at 59 common fruits and\nvegetables, including, in some cases, not just fresh versions but also canned,\ndried or frozen ones.\n\nOur new results continue to raise red flags.\n\nPesticides posed significant risks in 20% of the foods we examined, including\npopular choices such as bell peppers, blueberries, green beans, potatoes and\nstrawberries. One food, green beans, had residues of a pesticide that hasn\u2019t\nbeen allowed to be used on the vegetable in the US for over a decade. And\nimported produce, especially some from Mexico, was particularly likely to\ncarry risky levels of pesticide residues.\n\nCan you wash pesticides off your food? A guide to eating fewer toxic chemicals\n\nRead more\n\nBut there was good news, too. Pesticides presented little to worry about in\nnearly two-thirds of the foods, including nearly all of the organic ones. Also\nencouraging: the largest risks are caused by just a few pesticides,\nconcentrated in a handful of foods, grown on a small fraction of US farmland.\n\u201cThat makes it easier to identify the problems and develop targeted\nsolutions,\u201d Rogers says \u2013 though he acknowledges that it will take time and\neffort to get the Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates the use of\npesticides on crops, to make the necessary changes.\n\n> The way the EPA assesses pesticide risk doesn\u2019t reflect cutting-edge science\n\nConsumer Reports senior scientist Michael Hansen\n\nIn the meantime, our analysis offers insights into simple steps you can take\nto limit exposure to harmful pesticides, such as using our ratings to identify\nwhich fruits and vegetables to focus on in your diet, and when buying organic\nproduce can make the most sense.\n\n## What\u2019s safer, what\u2019s risky, and why\n\nSixteen of the 25 fruits and 21 of the 34 vegetables in our analysis had low\nlevels of pesticide risk. Even children and pregnant people can safely eat\nmore than three servings a day of those foods, Consumer Reports\u2019 food safety\nexperts say. Ten foods were of moderate risk; up to three servings a day of\nthem are OK.\n\nThe flip side: 12 foods presented bigger concerns. Children and pregnant\npeople should consume less than a serving a day of high-risk fruits and\nvegetables, and less than half a serving a day of very high-risk ones.\nEveryone else should limit consumption of those foods, too.\n\nIllustration: Sarah Anne Ward/Consumer Reports\n\nTo come up with that advice, we analyzed the USDA\u2019s test results for 29,643\nindividual food samples. We rated the risk of each fruit or vegetable by\nfactoring in how many pesticides showed up in the food, how often they were\nfound, the amount of each pesticide detected and each chemical\u2019s toxicity.\n\nThe Alliance for Food and Farming, a farming industry organization, pointed\nout to Consumer Reports that more than 99% of foods tested by the USDA\ncontained pesticide residues below the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s legal\nlimits (referred to as tolerances).\n\nBut Consumer Reports\u2019 scientists think many EPA tolerances are set too high.\nThat\u2019s why we use lower limits for pesticides that can harm the body\u2019s\nneurological system or are suspected endocrine disruptors (meaning they may\nmimic or interfere with the body\u2019s hormones). Consumer Reports\u2019 approach also\naccounts for the possibility that other health risks may emerge as we learn\nmore about these chemicals.\n\nKale, watermelon and even some organic foods pose high pesticide risk,\nanalysis finds\n\nRead more\n\n\u201cThe way the EPA assesses pesticide risk doesn\u2019t reflect cutting-edge science\nand can\u2019t account for all the ways the chemicals might affect people\u2019s health,\nespecially given that people are often exposed to multiple pesticides at a\ntime,\u201d says Consumer Reports senior scientist Michael Hansen. \u201cSo we take a\nprecautionary approach, to make sure we don\u2019t underestimate risks.\u201d\n\nIn our analysis, a fruit or vegetable can contain several pesticides but still\nbe considered low-risk if the combination of the number, concentration and\ntoxicity of them is low. For example, broccoli fared well not because it had\nno pesticide residues but because higher-risk chemicals were at low levels and\non just a few samples.\n\nSome of the most problematic foods, on the other hand, had relatively few\nresidues but worrisome levels of some high-risk pesticides.\n\nCase in point: watermelon. It\u2019s very high-risk mainly because of a pesticide\ncalled oxamyl. Only 11 of 331 conventional, domestic watermelon samples tested\npositive for oxamyl. But it\u2019s among those that Consumer Reports\u2019 experts\nbelieve require extra caution because of their potential for serious health\nrisks.\n\nGreen beans are another example. They qualify as high-risk primarily because\nof a pesticide called acephate or one of its breakdown products,\nmethamidophos. Only 4% of conventional, domestic green bean samples were\npositive for one or both \u2013 but their pesticide levels were often alarmingly\nhigh. In one sample from 2022 (the most recent year for which data was\navailable), methamidophos levels were more than 100 times the level Consumer\nReports\u2019 scientists consider safe; in another, acephate levels were seven\ntimes higher. And in some 2021 samples, levels were higher still.\n\n> You can eat a variety of healthy fruits and vegetables without stressing too\n> much about pesticide risk\n\nRegistered dietitian Amy Keating\n\nThis is especially troubling because neither chemical should be on green beans\nat all: growers in the US have been prohibited from applying acephate to green\nbeans since 2011, and methamidophos to all food since 2009.\n\n\u201cWhen you grab a handful of green beans at the supermarket or pick out a\nwatermelon, your chance of getting one with risky pesticide levels may be\nrelatively low,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cBut if you do, you could get a much higher dose\nthan you should, and if you eat the food often, the chances increase.\u201d\n\nIn some cases a food qualifies as high-risk because of several factors, such\nas high levels of a moderately dangerous pesticide on many samples. Example:\nchlorpropham on potatoes. It\u2019s not the most toxic pesticide \u2013 but it was on\nmore than 90% of tested potatoes.\n\n## How pesticides can harm you\n\nPesticides are one of the only categories of chemicals we manufacture\n\u201cspecifically to kill organisms\u201d, says Chensheng (Alex) Lu, an affiliate\nprofessor at the University of Washington in Seattle who researches the health\neffects of pesticide exposure. So it\u2019s no surprise, he says, that pesticides\nused to manage insects, fungi and weeds may harm people, too.\n\nWhile there are still open questions about exactly how and to what extent\nchronic exposure to pesticides can harm our health, scientists are piecing\ntogether a compelling case that some can, drawing on a mix of laboratory,\nanimal and human research.\n\nOne type of evidence comes from population studies looking at health outcomes\nin people who eat foods with relatively high pesticide levels. A recent review\nin the journal Environmental Health, which looked at six such studies, found\nevidence linking pesticides to increased risks of cancer, diabetes and\ncardiovascular disease.\n\nStronger evidence of pesticides\u2019 dangers comes from research looking at people\nwho may be particularly vulnerable to pesticides, including farm workers and\ntheir families. In addition to the thousands of workers who become ill from\npesticide poisonings every year, studies have linked on-the-job use of a\nvariety of pesticides with a higher risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease, breast\ncancer, diabetes and many more health problems.\n\nOther research found that exposure during pregnancy to a common class of\npesticides called organophosphates was associated with poorer intellectual\ndevelopment and reduced lung function in the children of farm workers.\n\nPregnancy and childhood are times of particular vulnerability to pesticides,\nin part because certain pesticides can be endocrine disruptors. Those are\nchemicals that interfere with hormones responsible for the development of a\nvariety of the body\u2019s systems, especially reproductive systems, says Tracey\nWoodruff, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco.\n\nAnother concern is that long-term exposure to even small amounts of pesticides\nmay be especially harmful to people with chronic health problems, those who\nlive in areas where they are exposed to many other toxins and people who face\nother social or economic health stresses, says Jennifer Sass, a senior\nscientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nIllustration: Sarah Anne Ward/Consumer Reports\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons, she says, regulators should employ extra safety\nmargins when setting pesticide limits \u2013 to account for all the uncertainty in\nhow pesticides might harm us.\n\n## How to stop eating pesticides\n\nWhile our analysis of USDA pesticide data found that some foods still have\nworrisome levels of certain dangerous pesticides, it also offers insights into\nhow you can limit your pesticide exposure now, and what government regulators\nshould do to fix the problem in the long term.\n\nEat lots of low-risk produce. A quick scan of this chart makes one thing\nclear: there are lots of good options to choose from.\n\nA chart of different fruits and vegetables and their pesticide risk.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d says Amy Keating, a registered dietitian at Consumer Reports.\n\u201cYou can eat a variety of healthy fruits and vegetables without stressing too\nmuch about pesticide risk, provided you take some simple steps at home.\u201d (See\nCan you wash pesticides off your food? A guide to eating fewer toxic\nchemicals.)\n\nYour best bet is to choose produce rated low-risk or very low-risk in our\nanalysis and, when possible, opt for organic instead of riskier foods you\nenjoy. Or swap in lower-risk alternatives for riskier ones. For example, try\nsnap peas instead of green beans, cantaloupe in place of watermelon, cabbage\nor dark green lettuces for kale, and the occasional sweet potato instead of a\nwhite one.\n\nBut you don\u2019t need to eliminate higher-risk foods from your diet. Eating them\noccasionally is fine.\n\n\u201cThe harm, even from the most problematic produce, comes from exposure during\nvulnerable times such as pregnancy or early childhood, or from repeated\nexposure over years,\u201d Rogers says.\n\nSwitch to organic when possible. A proven way to reduce pesticide exposure is\nto eat organic fruits and vegetables, especially for the highest-risk foods.\nWe had information about organically grown versions for 45 of the 59 foods in\nour analysis. Nearly all had low or very low pesticide risk, and only two\ndomestically grown varieties \u2013 fresh spinach and potatoes \u2013 posed even a\nmoderate risk.\n\nOrganic foods\u2019 low-risk ratings indicate that the USDA\u2019s organic certification\nprogram, for the most part, is working.\n\n> It\u2019s always worth considering organic produce, [though] it\u2019s most important\n> for the fruits and vegetables that pose the greatest risk\n\nJames E Rogers, head of food safety at Consumer Reports\n\nPesticides aren\u2019t totally prohibited on organic farms, but they are sharply\nrestricted. Organic growers may use pesticides only if other practices \u2013 such\nas crop rotation \u2013 can\u2019t fully address a pest problem. Even then, farmers can\napply only low-risk pesticides derived from natural mineral or biological\nsources that have been approved by the USDA\u2019s National Organic Program.\n\nLess pesticide on food means less in our bodies: multiple studies have shown\nthat switching to an organic diet quickly reduces dietary exposure. Organic\nfarming protects health in other ways, too, especially of farm workers and\nrural residents, because pesticides are less likely to drift into the areas\nwhere they live or to contaminate drinking water.\n\nAnd organic farming protects other living organisms, many of which are even\nmore vulnerable to pesticides than we are. For example, organic growers can\u2019t\nuse a class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, a group of chemicals that\nmay cause developmental problems in young children \u2013 and is clearly hazardous\nto aquatic life, birds and important pollinators including honeybees, wild\nbees and butterflies.\n\nThe rub, of course, is price: organic food tends to cost more \u2013 sometimes much\nmore.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, while we think it\u2019s always worth considering organic produce,\nit\u2019s most important for the handful of fruits and vegetables that pose the\ngreatest pesticide risk,\u201d Rogers says. He also says that opting for organic is\nmost crucial for young children and during pregnancy, when people are extra\nvulnerable to the potential harms of the chemicals.\n\nWatch out for some imports. Overall, imported fruits and vegetables and those\ngrown domestically are pretty comparable, with roughly an equal number of them\nposing a moderate or worse pesticide risk. But imports, particularly from\nMexico, can be especially risky.\n\nSeven imported foods in our analysis pose a very high risk, compared with just\nfour domestic ones. And of the 100 individual fruit or vegetable samples in\nour analysis with the highest pesticide risk levels, 65 were imported. Most of\nthose \u2013 52 \u2013 came from Mexico, and the majority involved strawberries (usually\nfrozen) or green beans (nearly all contaminated with acephate, the pesticide\nthat\u2019s prohibited for use on green beans headed to the US).\n\nA spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration told Consumer Reports that\nthe agency is aware of the problem of acephate contamination on green beans\nfrom Mexico. Between 2017 and 2024, the agency has issued import alerts on 14\nMexican companies because of acephate found on green beans. These alerts allow\nthe FDA to detain the firms\u2019 food shipments until they can prove the foods are\nnot contaminated with the illegal pesticide residues in question.\n\nThe Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, which represents many major\nimporters of fruits and vegetables from Mexico, did not respond to a request\nfor comment.\n\nRogers, at Consumer Reports, says: \u201cClearly, the safeguards aren\u2019t working as\nthey are supposed to.\u201d As a result, \u201cconsumers are being exposed to much\nhigher levels of very dangerous pesticides than they should.\u201d Because of those\nrisks, he suggests checking packaging on green beans and strawberries for the\ncountry of origin, and consider other sources, including organic.\n\n## How to solve the pesticide problem\n\nPerhaps the most reassuring, and powerful, part of Consumer Reports\u2019 analysis\nis that it demonstrates that the risks of pesticides are concentrated in just\na handful of foods and pesticides.\n\nOf the nearly 30,000 total fruit and vegetable samples Consumer Reports looked\nat, just 2,400, or about 8%, qualified as high-risk or very high-risk. And\namong those samples, just two broad classes of chemicals, organophosphates and\na similar type of pesticide called carbamates, were responsible for most of\nthe risk.\n\n\u201cThat not only means that most of the produce Americans consume has low levels\nof pesticide risk, but it makes trying to solve the problem much more\nmanageable, by letting regulators and growers know exactly what they need to\nconcentrate on,\u201d says Brian Ronholm, head of food policy at Consumer Reports.\n\nIllustration: Sarah Anne Ward/Consumer Reports\n\nOrganophosphates and carbamates became popular after DDT and related\npesticides were phased out in the 1970s and 1980s. But concerns about these\npesticides soon followed. While the EPA has removed a handful of them from the\nmarket and lowered limits on some foods for a few others, many\norganophosphates and carbamates are still used on fruits and vegetables.\n\nTake, for instance, phosmet, an organophosphate that is the main culprit\nbehind blueberries\u2019 poor score. Until recently, phosmet rarely appeared among\nthe most concerning samples of pesticide-contaminated food. But in recent\nyears, it\u2019s become a main contributor of pesticide risk in some fruits and\nvegetables, according to our analysis.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s happened in part because when a high-risk pesticide is banned or\npushed off the market, some farmers switch to a similar one still on the\nmarket that too often ends up posing comparable or even greater harm,\u201d says\nCharles Benbrook, an independent expert on pesticide use and regulation, who\nconsulted with Consumer Reports on our pesticide analysis.\n\n> We just don\u2019t need [pesticides]. And the foods American consumers eat every\n> day would be much, much safer without them\n\nBrian Ronholm, head of food policy at Consumer Reports\n\nConsumer Reports\u2019 food safety experts say our current analysis has identified\nseveral ways the EPA, FDA and USDA could better protect consumers.\n\nThat includes doing a more effective job of working with agricultural agencies\nin other countries and inspecting imported food, especially from Mexico, and\nconducting and supporting research to more fully elucidate the risks of\npesticides. In addition, the government should provide more support to organic\nfarmers and invest more federal dollars to expand the supply of organic food \u2013\nwhich would, in turn, lower prices for consumers.\n\nBut one of the most effective, and simple, steps the EPA could take to reduce\noverall pesticide risk would be to ban the use of any organophosphate or\ncarbamate on food crops.\n\nThe EPA told Consumer Reports that \u201ceach chemical is individually evaluated\nbased on its toxicity and exposure profile\u201d, and that the agency had required\nextra safety measures for several organophosphates.\n\nBut Consumer Reports\u2019 Ronholm says that approach is insufficient. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen\ntime and again that doesn\u2019t work. Industry and farmers simply hop over to\nanother related chemical that may pose similar risks.\u201d\n\nCanceling two whole classes of pesticides may sound extreme. \u201cBut the vast\nmajority of fruits and vegetables eaten in the US are already grown without\nhazardous pesticides,\u201d Ronholm says. \u201cWe just don\u2019t need them. And the foods\nAmerican consumers eat every day would be much, much safer without them.\u201d\n\nRead more from this pesticide investigation:\n\n  * Can you wash pesticides off your food?
