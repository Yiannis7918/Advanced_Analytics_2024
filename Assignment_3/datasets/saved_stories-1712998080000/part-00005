Digital health has always been challenging\nto build in \u2014 with lengthier sales cycles, higher implementation costs, and\nregulatory red tape all over. Tack on the pressure of rising interest rates\nmaking capital costly and startup valuations tank, investors are skittish.\nFunding into digital health startups in 2022 was only half of 2021\u2019s.\n\nYet, it\u2019s a great time to build a digital health startup. Funding in 2022\nmarked the second highest year ever. Experienced investors are sticking around\nbecause the long-term opportunity is clear. And on top of that, the digital\nhealth gold rush over the past ten years has produced builders with earned\nindustry knowledge. This resetting moment leaves us with more disciplined,\nprofit-driven founders.\n\nI\u2019ve met with 100+ of these early-stage founders over the past year building\nboth healthcare SaaS and tech-enabled care delivery services, to understand\nthe challenges and opportunities across their companies. I\u2019ve also gotten a\nfront row seat of the successes and mistakes of my own healthcare\ninfrastructure startup. I\u2019m here to share with early-stage founders the common\npitfalls I\u2019ve seen specific to building in digital health \u2014 and advice on how\nto avoid them.\n\nThe goal is to help founders on the frontlines pushing healthcare innovations\nforward weather the storm over the next few years, so there are more winners\nthat emerge and better outcomes delivered. I also hope this advice helps\ngeneralist investors better evaluate and win digital health deals, and support\nhealthcare founders with empathy.\n\nAdvice covered:\n\n  1. Surround yourself with a bilingual team who speaks tech and healthcare\n  2. Start focused by building a wedge, not a platform\n  3. Own the secret sauce in your digital health tech stack\n  4. Sell into the whales of healthcare\n  5. Manage your financial health obsessively, more so than non-healthcare peers\n  6. Deliver and track the right clinical outcomes\n\n## 1\\. Surround yourself with a bilingual team who speaks tech and healthcare\n\nThe pitfall: Founders who\u2019ve never worked in healthcare, thinking they can\nbuild a successful healthcare company on their own.\n\nIn other industries, a compelling founder story may suffice as founder-market\nfit. Example: \u201cI wear a lot of makeup, so am going to launch a new makeup\nline\u201d says every celebrity makeup brand founder ever. But this doesn\u2019t work in\nhealthcare. Healthcare is still an exclusive and clubby industry, with a high\nlearning curve to map out all the players and incentives.\n\nHaving a bilingual team means having both technical and healthcare expertise.\nA common archetype you see in founders is the technologist-clinician duo.\nBeing able to speak both clinical and technical language becomes an unfair\nadvantage in making it easier to open doors to enterprise players and quickly\nbuilding user-centered products that play well with practitioners\u2019 and\nmembers\u2019 entrenched workflows.\n\nAs you hire your team, it\u2019s especially important that this healthcare\nproficiency exists in your key product and sales hires. Your leadership teams\nneeds to be able to translate patient and provider needs into roadmap, and\nbuild relationships with healthcare decision makers.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the expertise on your founding team, supplementing with\nstrong clinical advisors or strategic healthcare investors can be the next\nbest thing.\n\n## 2\\. Start focused by building a wedge, not a platform\n\nThe pitfall: Founders who start out by building an \u201call-in-one\u201d digital health\nplatform serving tons of different customer segments.\n\nFor a time, I trialed the tagline, \u201cShopify for digital health\u201d at my startup.\nIt didn\u2019t stick. The analogy of \u201cShopify\u201d conjures up the image of a breadthy\nplatform that you can build any patient engagement solution on top of. What I\nforgot was that Shopify in their early days had a clear value proposition they\ncould point to in their product: helping e-commerce owners track orders and\nautomate inventory automatically. They were a tool, not a platform.\n\nInstead of focusing on breadth, it\u2019s smarter to build depth in the early days.\nThe natural evolution of winners like Shopify are tool \u2192 platform \u2192 ecosystem.\nBe a wedge by doing one thing very well that solves a big pain point for\ncustomers. If your ambition is to build the \u201cShopify for digital health,\u201d\nmaybe wedge in by solving the scheduling conundrum first. You\u2019ll have a clear\nvalue proposition, more repeatable go-to-market motions, and differentiation\nof yourself in markets with growing numbers of competitors. This drives\nacquisition in your ICP, and customer value on your P&L.\n\nThe key is that while you\u2019re building a wedge, you should already have a\nvision, and ideally, multiple paths mapped for becoming a platform. You should\ntest hypotheses with your early customers in order to decide which paths will\ncatapult you into becoming the winner of a market with large TAM. Expansion\ncan take two flavors: how many new customers you can capture, and/or how much\nmore ARPU you can capture.\n\n## 3\\. Own the secret sauce in your digital health tech stack\n\nThe pitfall: Founders who take venture dollars to build a tech company, but\ndon\u2019t build a tech moat and end up becoming a services company.\n\nHealthcare is a services industry with thin margins; 33%+ of hospitals are\noperating on negative margins. The vision of tech-enabled care delivery is\nthat the \u201ctech\u201d can lower COGS, increase revenue, and drive better margins;\nand this can produce venture-sized returns. Yet, there\u2019s this inevitable pull\nin healthcare towards becoming services heavy, and for founders to eschew\nbuilding their own tech in favor of speed to market.\n\nFor a tech-enabled service, you avoid this trap by building and owning your\nsecret sauce. A good exercise is to map out your product specs. Go down your\nfeature set and ask yourself: Is it core to your clinical model? Does it\ndifferentiate you from competitors? Does it create future value for your\nenterprise strategy? If all three are checked, then it\u2019s your secret sauce to\nbuild. Everything else, you can buy. Let\u2019s take the example of a tech-enabled\ncare navigation company; they\u2019ll likely buy an off-the-shelf EHR and build the\nrisk-scoring technology to power intelligent navigation.\n\nWhat founders often forget is the long-term value created of owning your\nsecret sauce from the start. As you grow, you aren\u2019t dependent on external\nvendors (product limitations, changing pricing, vendor death), avoid switching\ncosts, and can shore up your product IP and moat.\n\nA general rule of thumb to know if you\u2019re on the right track:\n\n> the difference between a tech-enabled services company and a services\n> company is simple.\n>\n> for a tech-enabled services company, revenue scales non-linearly as COGS\n> scale linearly. anything else is a services company\n>\n> \u2014 Morgan Cheatham (@morgancheatham) January 31, 2023\n\nOn vendor death, as more and more \u201cdigital health tech stack\u201d vendors have\nbeen spinning up with tempting promises to save companies time, money and\ncompliance headaches, you should understand the risk of becoming reliant on a\nstartup vendor who faces the same market pressures as you do. Always do your\ndiligence on your vendor\u2019s business, including asking for their runway (see\n#5).\n\nMeanwhile, for healthcare SaaS founders, be mindful of your implementation\nprocess. You don\u2019t want to become a consulting services shop building systems\nintegrators, doing custom work, and racking up high implementation costs for\neach customer. The goal is to be self-serve which oftentimes comes with being\na tool, not a platform (see #2).\n\n## 4\\. Sell into the whales of healthcare\n\nThe pitfall: Founders who see early success with small fish, with no plans to\nsell into whales.\n\nOn the journey to product-market fit, founders are looking for quick and early\nsigns of traction. For a tech-enabled service company, this means selling\ndirect-to-consumer; and for a healthcare SaaS company, to independent\npractitioners, SMBs and other digital health startups. The trouble with these\nearly successes is that it doesn\u2019t scale, as you\u2019ll ultimately run into high\nCAC, low ACV, and high churn.\n\nTo achieve usage at scale, you need to have a plan of how you\u2019re going to win\nenterprise from the start. Derick En\u2019Wezoh from Susa Ventures said it to be\nbest: You\u2019ve got to sell into the \u201cwhales\u201d of healthcare \u2014 health plans,\nhospital systems, provider groups, and let\u2019s include biopharma and employers\nin there too for good measure.\n\nThese relationships take lengthy sales cycles to close \u2014 closing a hospital\nsystem averages 12 to 18 months to navigate their operational budget cycles\n(closing health plans take even longer!), identify an internal champion, put\ntogether a compelling ROI use case, and navigate bureaucratic procurement\nprocesses. Which is why you need to plan for your GTM upmarket earlier than\nlater. The minute you see repeatable usage patterns among a core customer\nprofile, you should begin your motions into enterprise.\n\nAnother relevant pitfall I see here is founders thinking their enterprise\nstrategy is completely separate from their DTC or SMB starting point. It\u2019s\ntrue that SMB and enterprise sales are different motions and require different\nGTM teams. But founders should be able to identify needs that are common to\nboth small fish and whales so early traction can be laddered up into building\na compelling ROI use case for enterprise. For example, if you\u2019re planning on\ndoing VBC contracts with payers, you have to make sure your gathering the\nright evidence in your DTC channels. If you want to sell into big employers\nwith a B2C2B strategy, it probably makes sense to focus your customer\nacquisition in regions where they have lots of employees.\n\nTwo resources I recommend here are a16z\u2019s B2C2B playbook, and Rock Health\u2019s\nold but still highly relevant guide on streamlining enterprise sales.\n\n## 5\\. Manage your financial health obsessively, more so than non-healthcare\npeers\n\nThe pitfall: Founders pushing growth at all costs, just to find themselves at\nthe end of the line with zero cash in the bank.\n\nThis is true for every founder, but I argue that healthcare founders need to\nmanage their balance sheets even more closely. You must have a solid business\nmodel that bends the traditional P&L of care (remember those razor-thin\nmargins?), either by making it less costly to provide care or by improving\noutcomes without making care more expensive. And in finding the right balance\non the growth vs. profitability spectrum, err towards improving margins in\nthese market conditions. Healthcare is a long game, which means being the one\nleft standing at the end can be a competitive advantage in itself.\n\nThere are some unique levers that are worth revisiting:\n\nFirstly, sales cycles in healthcare are lengthier. You know that closing an\nenterprise customer could take 18+ months, so you should plan for at least two\nto three years of runway. Daisy Wolf at a16z recommends founders go into\ninvestor conversations from a position of strength by having at least 12\nmonths of runway. Running out of cash in healthcare doesn\u2019t just impact\nemployees, customers and investors; but more detrimentally, the human lives\nunder care too.\n\nSecondly, COGS are generally higher, especially as you get up and running. For\nhealthcare SaaS, this means implementation and support costs. For tech-enabled\nservices, expect better gross margins over time (e.g., from 25% to 60%+) as\nyou leverage tech to improve provider efficiencies. Be patient early on and\nexpect lower gross margins than the generalized benchmarks that are published\nonline.\n\nWhile this may ring alarm bells of \u201cWhy am I building (or investing) in\nhealthcare, anyways?,\u201d the big upside is there\u2019s a much larger TAM to capture\nand higher YOY growth. Where the average TAM of a cloud SaaS business is\n$10B+, the average TAM of a tech-enabled healthcare service is 14x that.\n\nLook to healthcare-specific benchmarks like Bessemer\u2019s Benchmarks for growing\nhealth tech businesses to see how your costs and sales compare.\n\n## 6\\. Deliver and track the right clinical outcomes\n\nThe pitfall: Founders reciting ARR, EBITDA, LTV:CAC, ARPU, TAM... with no\nmention of clinical outcomes delivered.\n\nI sat in 75+ calls with investors when my startup was raising our seed round.\nIt surprised me how often investors dug in on financial outcomes, and\ncompletely glossed over clinical outcomes. On the other side of the table,\nI\u2019ve noticed founders making clinical claims splashed on their market site and\nads, yet under the hood have little clinical robustness. While financial\noutcomes are not always tied to clinical outcomes and vice versa, a successful\ndigital health startup must be able to demonstrate both.\n\nFounders should be obsessed with delivering and tracking the right clinical\noutcomes. What\u2019s \u201cright\u201d will vary based on your model. A good exercise is to\nwrite down the measures that matter most to all the different stakeholders of\nyour solution, including patients, practitioners, current buyers and future\nenterprise buyers. Understanding what measures overlap between all your\nstakeholders will help prioritize and align goals and incentives. Tracking\nthem longitudinally will help you identify how to improve the quality and\neffectiveness of your services.\n\nWhen you\u2019re starting out, your dataset may be limited, but you can point to\ncompelling qualitative customer testimonials or references. Over time, you\u2019ll\nrely on more and more quantitative data like readmission, mortality, safety of\ncare, and NPS scores. And getting FDA clearance or approval on your device and\ntherapeutics, running clinical trials, and publishing results in academic\njournals can establish your clinical IP and moat.\n\nPlaying the long game, all these outcomes will be packaged into a compelling\nROI use case to convince risk-adverse enterprise customers into making a\npurchasing decision (see #4. For example, that your virtual pre- and post-ops\ncare navigator for the surgery department can decrease no-show rates, improve\ntimeliness of care for patients, and increase revenue.\n\nUltimately, make the case for how clinical outcomes are also good for your\ncustomer\u2019s financial outcomes; for example, in improving engagement, helping\nyou to upsell, and reducing member churn.\n\n## The best time to build in digital health\n\nIf I had five cents for every time I\u2019ve heard someone say, \u201cThis is the best\ntime to build,\u201d I\u2019d have a dollar. (Actually, Yoni Rechtman from Slow Ventures\nmade me aware that he published an article titled exactly this, so it\u2019s $1.05\nnow.) I\u2019m apologizing in advance that you have to hear it again.\n\nI believe this is the best time to build in digital health, and that the\nbiggest digital health unicorns are going to come from this downturn \u2014 because\nthey\u2019ll be healthy, profitable, disciplined businesses.\n\nI want to support early-stage founders who\u2019re in the trenches building these\nunicorns. If you have other common pitfalls and advice to share, I\u2019d love to\nhear and collate them as additional resources to founders. Reach out via email\nor Twitter.\n\nTons of gratitude to Yoni Rechtman, Sean Day, and Daisy Wolf for the feedback\nand notes on this article.\n\nI write about early startup lessons, the future of healthcare, and everything\nin between.\n\nBetty Chang's bitforms\n\nbetty chang\n\n", "frontpage": false}
