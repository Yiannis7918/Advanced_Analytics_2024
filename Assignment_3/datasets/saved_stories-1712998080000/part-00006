Hayek, \u201cThe Use of Knowledge in Society\u201d\n\nSilicon Valley venture capitalists and many entrepreneurs espouse libertarian\nvalues. In practice, they subscribe to central planning: Rather than competing\nto win in the marketplace, entrepreneurs compete for funding from the Silicon\nValley equivalent of the Central Committee. The race to the top is no longer\ndriven by who has the best product or the best business model, but by who has\nthe blessing of the venture capitalists with the deepest pockets\u2014a blessing\nthat will allow them to acquire the most customers the most quickly, often by\nproviding services below cost. Reid Hoffman called this pattern\n\u201cblitzscaling,\u201d claiming in the subtitle of his book with that name that it is\n\u201cThe Lightning-Fast Path to Building Massively Valuable Companies.\u201d\n\nI disagree. It is a dark pattern, a map to suboptimal outcomes rather than the\ntrue path to competition, innovation and the creation of robust companies and\nmarkets. As Bill Janeway noted in his critique of the capital-fueled bubbles\nthat resulted from the ultra-low interest rates of the decade following the\n2007\u20132009 financial crisis, \u201ccapital is not a strategy.\u201d\n\nVenture capitalists don\u2019t have a crystal ball. To the extent that\nentrepreneurial funding is more concentrated in the hands of a few, private\nfinance can drive markets independent of consumer preferences and supply\ndynamics. Market discipline is significantly delayed\u2014until the initial public\noffering or later. And of course, today IPOs are delayed, often precisely\nbecause companies can get all the capital they need from a small number of\ndeep-pocketed investors. Founders and employees are even able to cash out some\nof their shares without having to face the scrutiny of public markets, much as\nif bettors on a horse race could take their money off the table as the horses\nround the first turn. Thus, far from finance being an extension of the market\n(with lots of independent signals aggregated to ensure competition and\nconsumer choice), capital can ignore the will of the market.\n\nThe ride-hailing business offers a classic example of the distortive over-\nreliance on capital rather than consumer choice. It began with bold prophecies\nof ride-hailing replacing not just taxis but all private vehicles, and ended\nwith a national duopoly of on-demand taxis at prices no better and often worse\nthan those of the previous over-regulated local taxi market. In a well-\nfunctioning market, many startups would have explored a technology innovation\nlike on-demand transportation over a much longer period. In that alternate\nhistory, entrepreneurs would have competed with different pricing strategies,\ndifferent rate structures for drivers and perhaps even completely different\nbusiness models. Eventually, those that survived would have done so because\nthey were delivering the service chosen by the most customers and the most\ndrivers. That is true product-market fit.\n\nBut in the Central Committee version of Silicon Valley, Uber and Lyft, backed\nby billions of dollars of venture capital, drove out the competition rather\nthan defeating it, subsidizing customer acquisition and an unsustainable\nbusiness model\u2014and in the case of Uber, continuing to attract new capital with\npromises of speculative future cost savings via self-driving cars. Instead,\nonce the market had consolidated, Uber and Lyft only reached profitability\nthrough massive price increases. What might have happened if there had been\ntrue competition in this market? We will never know.\n\nBy contrast, during the dot-com bubble, most companies consumed tiny amounts\nof capital by today\u2019s standards. The funding was spread across thousands of\ncompanies, and it took a decade or more of relentless innovation and\ncompetition for the industry to become dangerously concentrated. This is a\nclassic example of what Janeway calls a \u201cproductive bubble.\u201d Remarkably, most\nof the winning companies were profitable in only a few years, and eventually\nthey became hugely profitable. Google raised only $36 million in venture\ncapital on its way to dominance. Facebook raised billions, but it did so only\nto fund faster growth for a business model that insiders have told me was very\nclose to profitable the entire time. They weren\u2019t buying users with subsidized\nprices; they were building data centers. Even Amazon, long unprofitable, took\nin very little investment capital, instead funding itself with debt supported\nby a business model that produced previously unprecedented levels of free cash\nflow.\n\nTo be sure, sometimes companies do require a lot of capital to lay the\ngroundwork for a possible future. Tesla and SpaceX are good examples. They\nused their funding to do serious research and development, to build factories,\ncars, batteries, rockets and satellites. This is using capital properly: to\nfund the hard costs associated with creating something new until the projected\nunit economics lead to a self-sustaining business. It\u2019s also worth noting that\nin those cases private funding was powerfully augmented by state support:\ncarbon credits and electric vehicle incentives for Tesla, and NASA progress\npayments for SpaceX.\n\nThat kind of investment was unnecessary in the case of ride-hailing. The\nstartups simply used the money to amass market power by subsidizing\nblitzscaled growth. Others had already deployed the capital to build much of\nthe infrastructure for ride-hailing\u2014GPS satellites and GPS-enabled\nsmartphones. Even the innovation of using GPS to match passengers and drivers\nwas not developed by the VC-backed market leaders, but by the true market\npioneer, Sidecar, which was quickly sidelined when it failed to raise enough\ncapital to gain a leading share in the market it had first envisioned.\n\nIn the case of artificial intelligence, training large models is indeed\nexpensive, requiring large capital investments. But those investments demand\ncommensurately large returns. The investors who pile billions of dollars into\na huge bet are expecting not just to be paid back, but paid back a\nhundredfold. The capital-fueled race to build the largest models has already\nled to bad behavior. OpenAI, for example, has trained not just on publicly\navailable data but reportedly on copyrighted content retrieved from pirate\nsites. This has led to lawsuits and settlements. But even those settlements\nare likely to be bad for the development of a healthy entrepreneurial\necosystem. As Mike Loukides points out, \u201cSmaller startups...will be priced\nout, along with every open-source effort. By settling, OpenAI will eliminate\nmuch of their competition.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the largest models\u2019 absorption of all content into \u201cthe Borg\u201d of AI\ndata will eliminate opportunities for the owners of specialized content\nrepositories to profit from their own work. Innovators are already finding\nthat much can be done at lower cost with smaller, more targeted open-source\nmodels. They can fine-tune these smaller models for specific problem domains,\nallowing trusted content providers (like my own company\u2019s O\u2019Reilly Answers and\nrelated AI-generated services) to profit from our own expertise.\n\nOpenAI is making an effort to create a platform on which entrepreneurs can\nbuild vertical applications, but only if they pay tribute to the centralized\nbusiness model in the form of API fees. OpenAI is also skimming the cream,\nquickly dominating some of the most profitable categories\u2014image generation,\nvideo generation, speech synthesis, computer programming\u2014that in a well-\nfunctioning market would be explored by dozens or hundreds of competing\nefforts, until one or two find the winning combination of product and business\nmodel. If entrepreneurs discover other profitable categories, giants such as\nOpenAI will move quickly to dominate these as well.\n\nThe capital-fueled AI land grab is of course only one axis of premature market\nconcentration. As Max von Thun points out in \u201cMonopoly Power Is the Elephant\nin the Room in the AI Debate,\u201d much of the investment to train models is\ncoming in the form of strategic partnerships (including both cloud computing\ncredits and potential revenue deals) with existing industry giants Microsoft,\nAmazon and Google (and in the case of open-source models, Meta Platforms). As\nvon Thun notes, \u201cThese partnerships appear to be serving the same purpose as\n\u2018killer acquisitions\u2019 in the past\u2014think of Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp\nor Google\u2019s purchase of YouTube\u2014raising serious concerns about fair\ncompetition in the fledgling AI market.\u201d The risk of these deals is, again,\nthat a few centrally chosen winners will quickly emerge, meaning there\u2019s a\nshorter and less robust period of experimentation.\n\nAnd, at least based on recent reporting by The Information about Anthropic\u2019s\noperating margins, it may be that, like Uber and Lyft, the overfunded AI\nmarket leaders may only be able to deliver on investors\u2019 heated expectations\nby crushing all competition. That\u2019s not betting on the wisdom of the market\nand what Hayek called \u201cthe utilization of knowledge which is not given to\nanyone in its totality.\u201d That\u2019s betting on premature consolidation and the\nwisdom of a few large investors to choose a future everyone else will be\nforced to live in.\n\nPost topics: AI & ML, Artificial Intelligence\n\nPost tags: Research\n\nShare:\n\n  * Tweet\n\n## Get the O\u2019Reilly Radar Trends to Watch newsletter\n\n> Tracking need-to-know trends at the intersection of business and technology.\n\n## Thank you for subscribing.\n\n## About O\u2019Reilly\n\n  * Teach/write/train\n  * Careers\n  * O\u2019Reilly news\n  * Media coverage\n  * Community partners\n  * Affiliate program\n  * Submit an RFP\n  * Diversity\n  * O\u2019Reilly for marketers\n\n## Support\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Newsletters\n  * Privacy policy\n\n## International\n\n  * Australia & New Zealand\n  * Hong Kong & Taiwan\n  * India\n  * Indonesia\n  * Japan\n\n## Download the O\u2019Reilly App\n\nTake O\u2019Reilly with you and learn anywhere, anytime on your phone and tablet.\n\n## Watch on your big screen\n\nView all O\u2019Reilly videos, Superstream events, and Meet the Expert sessions on\nyour home TV.\n\n## Do not sell my personal information\n\n\u00a9 2024, O\u2019Reilly Media, Inc.
