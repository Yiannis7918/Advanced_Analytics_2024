The recent Schmidt Ocean Institute expedition to\nthe underwater mountains of the Salas y G\u00f3mez Ridge, a remote and\nunderexplored area that stretches from offshore Chile to Rapa Nui, resulted in\nidentifying deep-sea corals, glass sponges, sea urchins, squids, fishes,\nmolluscs, crabs, sea stars, squat lobsters, and other species likely never-\nbefore observed by scientists.\n\nMech\u00f3, a researcher in the Climate Variability and Change group at the BSC\u2019s\nEarth Sciences Department, presented the results of the 40-day scientific\ncruise \u2018Unexplored Seamounts of the Salas y G\u00f3mez Ridge\u2019 and the current\nnegotiations to create a blue corridor in the area at the \u201cOcean Decade MPA\nForum: Progress, obstacles and solutions\u201d, an off-site event organised in the\nframework of the UN Ocean Decade Conference held in Barcelona from 10-12 April\n2024.\n\n\u201cThe main results of this campaign are that we have found between 50 and 60\npotentially new species at first sight, a number that is likely to increase as\nwe have many samples to work on in the laboratory. We also found one of the\ndeepest mesophotic corals in the world, extending the distribution of this\nPolynesian fauna by several hundred kilometres. And at depth, we have found\nfields of sponges and corals, habitats that are considered vulnerable and in\nneed of protection\u201d, said Mech\u00f3.\n\nThe expedition took place from 24 February to 4 April with an international\nteam of 25 scientists from 14 organisations in five countries (Chile, United\nStates, Italy, Spain, Netherlands), including the first Rapa Nui marine\nbiologist, Emilia Ra'a Palma Tuki, a recent graduate of the Universidad\nCat\u00f3lica del Norte in Chile. The Rapa Nui Sea Council, or Koro Nui o te\nVaikava, supported the expedition, providing the main permit to work in the\narea, and collaborated by providing a Koro Nui observer and a local sailing\nexpert to bring to the expedition their perspectives as members of the Rapa\nNui community.\n\nThe information collected during this research expedition will provide the\nscientific basis to inform the management of existing marine protected areas\nand potentially expand them, especially around the island of Rapa Nui.\n\n## One of the most unexplored areas of the planet\n\nFunded by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the cruise is devoted to studying the\necosystems of one of the most unexplored areas of the world, the submarine\nmountains and oceanic islands of the Salas y G\u00f3mez Ridge, which is a\n2,900-kilometre-long underwater mountain chain comprising more than 200\nseamounts from offshore Chile to Rapa Nui, otherwise known as Easter Island\n(or Isla de Pascua).\n\nThis ridge hosts one of the most unique and biodiverse seascapes on Earth,\nwith an extremely high rate of endemism, critical habitats for benthic\norganisms, essential migration corridors for highly mobile species, and the\npresence of over 80 threatened or endangered species.\n\nIn addition, the Salas y G\u00f3mez Ridge possesses a rich cultural and maritime\nheritage with profound connections to Indigenous islander and mainland\ncommunities and other nations. This remote, underexplored region likely\nharbours pristine and unexploited habitats with abundant biodiversity that\nrequire international cooperation to protect them before they are lost.\n\n## Modelling the ocean with supercomputing\n\nThe role of BSC and supercomputing in the campaign is to provide climate\nmodelling data through different scenarios to establish the distribution of\nkey species in the area. This will help us understand how these species will\nbe impacted by future changes, depending on each possible scenario.\n\n\u201cBut first, we need to better understand the biodiversity and connectivity of\nthe region to know which keystone species are found there and on which\nmountains exactly, as well as potential faunal breaks (where communities\nchange or stop connecting with each other). Basically, it is a unique\nexploration in places where practically everything is unexplored\u201d, said Mech\u00f3.\n\nThe aim is to provide the critical information to support the designation of\nthe Salas y Gomez Ridge as an ecologically and biologically significant marine\narea (EBSA) by the Convention on Biological Diversity and an ecological and\nsocioeconomic \u2018priority area\u2019 for international protection, by the High Seas\nTreaty (2023).\n\nThis cruise was strongly connected with an earlier campaign deployed between\nJanuary and February 2024 and focused on studying the junction between the\nSalas y Gomez and the Nazca Ridge, and the Desventuradas Islands. During the 2\ncruises, more than 100 new species have been discovered on the Salas y Gomez\nand the Nazca Ridge (SyGR), as well as coral and sponge gardens. That will\nemphasise the need for a blue corridor along the Salas y G\u00f3mez and Nazca\nRidges, creating one of the first and larger high-seas marine protected areas\nin the world.\n\n[Ariadna Mech\u00f3 received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020\nresearch and innovation programme under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie grant\nagreement No GA 101107435]\n\n### Find Us\n\nBarcelona Supercomputing Center Pla\u00e7a Eusebi G\u00fcell, 1-3 08034 Barcelona\n(Spain)\n\n### Contact Us\n\nTel.
