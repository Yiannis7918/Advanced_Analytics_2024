The demo site is running the demo branch which is usually\nahead of the latest release.\n\n  1. Install dependencies and clone the repository to the latest release tag. While demo site has maintained since version 1.x, avoid using the demo branch in production unless you are interested in keeping up with development and have a mechanism for emergency rollbacks.\n  2. Add and initialize your collection, customize .lipupini/files.json with captions, and delete the example collection.\n  3. Ensure that your files display. If they don't, convert them to supported formats.\n  4. Deploy to a PHP server.\n\nUpdating Lipupini can be as simple as running git pull from your environment\ndepending on the setup.\n\n## Features\n\n  * Support for the following media file formats: AVIF, FLAC, GIF, JPG, PNG, M4A, MP3, MP4, Markdown, OGG Vorbis\n  * Allows subscribing to your content collection via RSS2.0.\n  * Search Lipupini accounts from other Fediverse platforms via the ActivityPub protocol.\n  * Supports translations/internationalization: See module/Lukinview/L18n\n  * Automatically fix image orientation and strip private metadata thanks to Imagine library\n  * With ffmpeg available and useFfmpeg enabled, video thumbnails and audio waveforms can be generated automatically.\n  * Supports both \"hidden\" and \"unlisted\" options in files.json\n  * Once dependencies are installed, Lipupini is designed to get up and running quickly.\n  * API for retrieving collection data. See module/Lipupini/Collection/ApiRequest.php\n  * Media collections are self-contained, served as they are on your filesystem. Lipupini-specific collection files are stored in a special .lipupini folder, making account collections completely portable.\n  * Module system paves a way for collaborative development.\n  * Docker support. See deployment instructions.\n  * Show an avatar PNG when searching from an external ActivityPub or RSS client.\n  * Lipupini manages to implement ActivityPub without a database. Certain inbox activities can be logged to your collection in raw JSON. See system/config/state.php for the option.\n  * Minimalist grid layout. Frontend is ready to be customized, or you can make an entirely new frontend module.\n  * On-demand caching system creates and serves static media files. Support for custom caching URL can facilitate the use of a CDN.\n  * Public domain source code is the most permissive license there is. You can do whatever you want with this thing. Please feel free to contribute back to upstream, post in discussions, etc. There is no obligation of any kind.\n\n## Starting the PHP Webserver\n\nMake sure all dependencies are installed first.\n\n  1. Clone the app and cd into the project root\n\n    \n    \n    git clone https://github.com/lipupini/lipupini.git cd lipupini\n\n  2. Install Composer dependencies and go back to project root\n\n    \n    \n    cd module/Lipupini composer install cd ../..\n\n  3. Navigate to the webserver document root and start PHP's built-in webserver. See module/Lukinview/README.md for more information.\n\n    \n    \n    cd module/Lukinview/webroot PHP_CLI_SERVER_WORKERS=2 php -S localhost:4000 index.php\n\n  4. Visit http://localhost:4000/@example\n\n## Add Your Collection\n\nSay you have a folder of awesome photos at /home/sally/Pictures/AwesomePhotos\n\nYour Lipupini installation is at /opt/webapp/lipupini\n\n  1. Take the photos from /home/sally/Pictures/AwesomeCollection and put them into the collection directory /opt/webapp/lipupini/collection/sally either by copying them:\n\n    \n    \n    cp -R /home/sally/Pictures/AwesomeCollection /opt/webapp/lipupini/collection/sally\n\nor symlinking them:\n\n    \n    \n    ln -s /home/sally/Pictures/AwesomeCollection /opt/webapp/lipupini/collection/sally\n\n  2. Initialize the .lipupini folder for the collection\n\n    \n    \n    cd /opt/webapp/lipupini bin/generate-keys.php sally bin/create-files-json.php sally\n\n  3. Save a file called avatar.png at /opt/webapp/lipupini/collection/sally/.lipupini/avatar.png\n\n  4. Edit the file at /opt/webapp/lipupini/collection/sally/.lipupini/files.json to add captions (this is optional)\n\n  5. Delete the example collection:\n\n    \n    \n    rm -r collection/example\n\n  6. Your collection should now be viewable at http://localhost:4000/@sally\n\nIn addition to copying or symlinking, see collection/README.md#vision for\nideas on other ways to keep these directories in sync.\n\n## ActivityPub Note\n\nActivityPub transactions should occur via HTTPS per spec. https://ngrok.com\ncan be used to get up and running quickly for development.\n\nFor example, after starting Lipupini you can run this command:\n\n    \n    \n    ngrok http 4000\n\nContinuing with the example above in \"Add Your Collection,\" if your Ngrok URL\nbecomes https://f674-73.ngrok-free.app, you should then be able to query\n@sally@f674-73.ngrok-free.app from another Fediverse client once the\ncollection is initialized.\n\nUsing Ngrok, with an upgraded plan you can setup a fairly restrictive port\nfirewall, configure it to run on startup, and reliably host any domain with\nHTTPS.\n\n## The Name\n\n\"Lipupini\" is a \"word formed by combining other words\" (portmanteau), and\n\"lipu pini\" in this context translates to \"past document\" in Toki Pona core.\nLipupini is for organizing computer files like images, videos, sounds and\nwritings that you might want to display under your domain on the Internet.\n\n## Demo\n\nHere is what it can look like so far: https://lipupini-demo.dup.bz/@example\n\nThough ActivityPub implementation is currently limited, the demo is searchable\nin the Fediverse @example@lipupini-demo.dup.bz\n\nNOTE: Please use activitypub.academy Mastondon server for testing, as this is\na test server.\n\nThe demo is the demo branch running on Apache2. If you already have Apache2\nconfigured to serve PHP, you can install Composer dependencies and point the\nvirtual host's DocumentRoot to webroot and it should \"just work.\"\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are welcome to fork it, change it, add modules! Please don't hesitate to\nmake a PR that includes your own modules - it could be shipped with or\nintegrated into core.\n\nI hope that the module architecture makes for a good workflow, especially\nbeing open to merging new modules. In theory, modules could just as easily be\nComposer packages and not have a module directory at all. The current\narchitecture can still work seamlessly with the Composer pattern as well.\n\nEmail apps [at] dup.bz if you'd like a point of contact or post in\ndiscussions! Please reach out if you begin to find any aspect frustrating or\nfeel that it should be done in a different way.\n\nIf you want to use Lipupini for your artist portfolio or business website, I\nwill support your effort.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nVanJS: https://vanjs.org\n\nMarkdown parser: https://parsedown.org\n\nImage processor: https://github.com/php-imagine/Imagine\n\nArrow icons: https://www.svgrepo.com/author/Pictogrammers\n\nActivityPub inspiration: @dansup@pixelfed.social & Landrok's ActivityPub\nlibrary\n\n## TODO\n\n  * Add browser-side caching\n  * Add option for favicon in collection .lipupini folder\n  * bin/generate-files-json.php\n\n    * Make recursive\n    * Do not overwrite entries, or add option\n    * Read EXIF data if available for setting a default date\n  * Figure out something else besides exception when file in files.json does not exist in collection\n  * Create script to normalize file and directory user/group/permissions\n  * Output errors in layout\n  * Check on cross-platform compatibility, MacOS and Windows with and without Docker. While only tested on Linux, I believe it will work on all three OSes including ffmpeg interfaces as long as symlinking is supported.\n  * Update CLI commands for ffmpeg to take a collection folder name and collection path, determine output path automatically\n  * Look into:\n\n    * https://indieweb.org/Webmention\n    * https://indieweb.org/Microsub\n    * https://indieweb.org/Micropub\n    * https://atproto.com\n    * https://micropub.rocks\n  * Make contributions to landrok/activitypub\n  * Detect readline support in a custom confirm routine. If readline is not available a 10-second timer will be indicated that can be cancelled with CTRL+C.\n  * Create a mechanism for writing to a collection's files.json\n\n    * Could start with a CLI tool, e.g. bin/caption.php <collection> <filename> <caption>\n    * Would like to try creating a desktop tool\n  * Do not let same account try to follow more than once when already logged previous follow\n  * If a photo is taking a while to upload and a browser pageload is triggered with media processor requests in the request queue, the thumbnail version will likely only show a partial image.\n\n    * Removing all media processors from the HTTP request queue and only using bin/process-media.php after uploading is a solution.\n    * File transfer clients that use temporary files during transfer are a solution.\n    * Adding a file watcher daemon or transfer queue could help with an alternative solution.\n    * I would like to know if there is a way using pure PHP to detect if a file is still uploading via SFTP.\n\n## About\n\nLipupini is a public domain platform for organizing computer files like\nimages, videos, sounds and writings that you might want to display under your\ndomain on the Internet.
