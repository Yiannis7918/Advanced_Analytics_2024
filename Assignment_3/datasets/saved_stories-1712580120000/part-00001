I do note that the statement\ndoesn\u2019t say \u201call data records\u201d, so I suppose there might be some plausibility\nto the idea that Google might delete, say 7 BLN records of 20 BLN collected,\nwith every record deleted a redundant copy of one that remains.\n\nHugo \u2022 April 3, 2024 9:59 AM\n\nSo amazing that people still use Google\u2019s software. How many examples do we\nneed to understand that Google is not an honest company? Don\u2019t use their\nsoftware. You have a choice.\n\nWho? \u2022 April 3, 2024 10:08 AM\n\nHow can we be really sure Google removes all that data?\n\nGoogle is a data broker, one of the worst offenders in the field of privacy\nviolations I would say; in the past, nearly two decades ago, I had an account\non Google services like gmail, until someone working for Google at California\ncontacted with me offering a job because \u201csome emails I sent where tagged as\nimportant and one employee of the company read them\u201d.\n\nNow, I do not have a Google account anymore but, I am sure, even if I do not\nagree with Google\u2019s terms of service THEY WILL CONTINUE READING ANY EMAIL I\nSENT TO PEOPLE USING GMAIL ADDRESSES.\n\nGoogle should at least be banned in Europe. I have lost any hope about the\nUnited States doing the right thing with these data brokers.\n\nAdrian \u2022 April 3, 2024 12:46 PM\n\nI keep reading that one aspect of the settlement is that Google will allow\nIncognito user to block third-party cookies for five years.\n\nWhat does that mean? Does Chrome currently (or recently) prevent users from\nblocking third-party cookies? I\u2019ve always blocked third-party cookies by\ndefault. What changes in five years?\n\nSeparately from this suit and the settlement, Google has already proclaimed\nthat 2024 is the year they will phase-out third-party cookies altogether\n(while adding APIs that allow cross-site tracking through other means), so\nisn\u2019t this part of the settlement a nothing-burger?\n\nNoGoogle \u2022 April 3, 2024 1:44 PM\n\nAccording to https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/04/02/google-to-purge-private-\nincognito-mode-user-records-but-will-keep-snooping/ \u201cGoogle will delete\nbillions of records it scooped from \u201cIncognito\u201d mode web browsing of about 136\nmillion U.S. users but will continue to collect data through the not-so-\nprivate browser setting \u2014 it just has to disclose the grab.\u201d\n\nEven if you trust that Google will delete the data -true anonymization is\nalmost impossible to do-, they will be deleting data that is probably of\nlittle value going forward if they are allowed to keep collecting data from\nusers in incognito mode.\n\nIn surveillance capitalism, more recent data is of higher value than older\ndata because it has higher predictive value, in a statistical sense, on the\nads users are likely to click.\n\nAdrian \u2022 April 3, 2024 1:52 PM\n\n@NoGoogle: Is it irony that the Mercury News link you posted asks me to\ndisable Incognito in order to read the article about how Google\u2019s Incognito\nmode wasn\u2019t as private as users thought?\n\nEven funnier, I\u2019m not using Incognito mode. I\u2019m just blocking third-party\ncookies.\n\nNoGoogle \u2022 April 3, 2024 2:03 PM\n\nTo Who?,\n\n\u201cGoogle should at least be banned in Europe. I have lost any hope about the\nUnited States doing the right thing with these data brokers.\u201d\n\nAs a former European -I was born in a European country but a couple of decades\nago I immigrated to the United States; I have been making a living in tech\nduring this time but I formally renounced my former European citizenship upon\nbecoming an American citizen \u2013 I think that one key aspect in this whole\ndebate that the European press gets wrong is that the United States doesn\u2019t\ntake on Google for traditional political reasons (ie, left/wing politics). The\nactual reality is much different.\n\nUnlike what happens in Europe, paying politicians -and buying their vote- is\nlegal in the United States. It\u2019s called \u201ccampaign contributions\u201d and while\ntechnically there cannot be \u201cquid pro-quo\u201d -check the case of former Virginia\ngovernor Bob McDonnell who was unanimously exonerated by the US Supreme Court.\n\nOnce the leadership of Google understood that their company was destined to be\nbig \u2013 probably around 2005-2006- they made the conscious decision of\nparticipating in America\u2019s political process the traditional way to avoid the\ndestiny of Microsoft. As part of this strategy the company -not to be confused\nwith their employee base- donated to politicians and political centers of\npower of both Democrat and Republican administrations.\n\nTheir strategy worked for a long time. It is well documented that the Obama\nadministration set aside an antitrust lawsuit against Google its appointes had\nredied in 2013.\n\nWhen Trump came to power, Google kept playing the same gain with entities such\nas the Heritage Foundation and the CATO Institute that you can think of as\n\u201ccults of profit\u201d, ie organizations that worship profitable companies.\n\nI was very surprised when Biden decided to keep alive the antitrust lawsuit\nfiled by the Trump administration a couple of months before the 2020.\n\nGoogle also knows (check the anti trust cases against IBM and Bell Labs) that\neven if the company were to be broken up, things will take a long time and\nthey (Google) have the best lawyers money can buy.\n\nIn a situation like this, the best anyone can do is to take matters in his/her\nown hands: delete all your Google accounts, use Signal and use\nProtonMail/ProtonVPN. And if you family/friends use Gmail, convince them to do\notherwise.\n\nlurker \u2022 April 3, 2024 2:03 PM\n\n@Adrian \u201cDoes Chrome currently (or recently) prevent users from blocking\nthird-party cookies?\u201d\n\nNo, but to block them the user needs to know that third party cookies exist,\nand how to dig down through Chrome\u2019s Settings submenus.\n\n@NoGoogle \u201cGoogle will delete billions of records it scooped from \u201cIncognito\u201d\nmode web browsing of about 136 million U.S. users\u201d\n\nMeanwhile G will continue munching on the records it gained from all non-US\nusers, icluding Europe before the GDPR smacked them.\n\n@ Bruce \u2018Google must further update the Incognito mode \u201csplash page\u201d\u2019\n\nAnd of course the release note for the update will say in total, as always,\nThis update contains bug fixes, and performance improvements.\n\nDominick \u2022 April 3, 2024 2:07 PM\n\nThat\u2019s rather anti-climactic. I guess Google must have been really against\ndeleting the data, to let the lawsuit go on for 4 years before offering this\nnearly-meaningless settlement. And the class took it! It must\u2019ve been a really\nweak case. I wasn\u2019t necessarily expecting money, but they should\u2019ve pushed for\nGoogle to stop collecting data from people using privacy modes\u2014for example,\nhave Google modify Chrome to set the do-not-track flag when \u201cIncognito\u201d, and\nrequire Google to respect the flag from all browsers.\n\nRe: Adrian\u2019s mention of irony, Wired and Mercury News are both working fine\nfor me in Tor Browser (excepting that the Mercury byline is overlayed on top\nof the article\u2019s text; disabling the stylesheet helps).\n\nNoGoogle \u2022 April 3, 2024 2:11 PM\n\n@lurker\n\nNo question. Just to be clear, as a Silicon Valley resident I understood early\non what Google was about circa 2004/2005. Back then I was studying engineering\nas a graduate student at Stanford and Google was in a huge hiring spree. I\nrejected their hiring requests but the classmates I recall being the most\nenthusiastic about joining Google were people who couldn\u2019t care less about\nviolating people\u2019s privacy as long as they enjoyed the perks of being a Google\nemployee (well paid, free food, stock options/RSUs).\n\nGoogle has been buying the will of a lot of smart people for a long time. It\nwon\u2019t be easy to take on them. This lawsuit is a great example. Google has\nsettled. Is the settlement impacting their ability to continue to make money\nwith surveillance capitalism in any meaningful way? Obviously no.\n\nThank you for your comment.\n\nlurker \u2022 April 3, 2024 2:27 PM\n\n@Mercury News\n\nNo, it\u2019s not irony, just the American way: the Blocker splash says\n\nDISABLE INCOGNITO OR SUBSCRIBE TO CONTINUE\n\nI\u2019m not willing to pay a subscription just to check that option, but I too am\nnot using Incognito, or Chrome. I have an adblocker, and block 3rd party\ncookies, but MN loads text only and messed up css with .js OFF. Some papers,\nNYT is notable, now demand adblockers OFF, .js ON.\n\nlurker \u2022 April 3, 2024 2:38 PM\n\n@Dominick\n\nBSF, Attorneys for the Plaintiff, in an historic flashback, were also\nAttorneys for the Plaintiff in the casee of SCO vs. Everyone re. Who owns\nUnix/Linux?\n\nhttp://groklaw.net/\n\nBoris Reitman \u2022 April 3, 2024 2:45 PM\n\nI prefer being tracked via 3rd party cookies in order to see good, relevant\nads. And, I prefer seeing ads than paying for subscription. When I use the\nIncognito mode, I know that URLs that I browser are logged at the ISP. I can\u2019t\nexpect this data not to be leaked out. It\u2019s fine with me.\n\nNoGoogle \u2022 April 3, 2024 4:42 PM\n\n@lurker\n\nI have never used Chrome as my personal browser -when I am in hotels or\nsimilar places without my computer I have used it on occasion but I don\u2019t\nrecall having used it with my personal credentials.\n\nFor a long time, my personal browser was Firefox. When Brave came out, I\nswitched and I haven\u2019t looked back. Because Brave is kind of aggressive, when\nthings don\u2019t work out well there, I use Microsoft Edge as my backup.\n\nWhen it comes to VPNs, I used to use AirVPN -given that their central legal\nlocation is Italy- but around a couple of years ago I tried ProtonVPN. I still\nkeep AirVPN as a backup, but I love the Proton ecosystem.\n\nIn short, Google is a very untrustworthy company. If you are a security\nconscious person, the last thing you do is to use their services with your\nreal id (or even a fake ID).\n\nDavid Levine \u2022 April 3, 2024 7:20 PM\n\nCongrats on the win! At the same time, I am a well educated person who reads\nthis blog regularly. Nevertheless, I have no idea what it means to my privacy\nthat Google collects data from third-party websites \u201cregardless of which\nbrowsing or browser mode you use,\u201d and that \u201cthird-party sites and apps that\nintegrate our services may still share information with Google.\u201d Unless we\nknow the uses of the data at the intermediate stage (as in famous examples of\nwho is pregnant or who is gay) and at the final stage (as in raising prices on\na website, telling the FBI whom to investigate, etc.), we are still giving up\nprivacy in ways we cannot understand. I appreciate your leadership in this\nlarger fight.\n\nSubscribe to comments on this entry\n\n## Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n\u2190 xz Utils Backdoor Surveillance by the New Microsoft Outlook App \u2192\n\nSidebar photo of Bruce Schneier by Joe MacInnis.\n\nPowered by WordPress Hosted by Pressable\n\n### About Bruce Schneier\n\nI am a public-interest technologist, working at the intersection of security,\ntechnology, and people.
