A military spokesman said the launches numbered more than 300\nbut 99% of them were intercepted.\n\nCalling the outcome \u201ca very significant strategic success,\u201d Rear Adm. Daniel\nHagari said Iran fired 170 drones, more than 30 cruise missiles and more than\n120 ballistic missiles. Of those, several ballistic missiles reached Israeli\nterritory, causing minor damage to an air base.\n\nRescuers said a 7-year-old girl in a Bedouin Arab town was seriously wounded\nin southern Israel, apparently in a missile strike, though they said police\nwere still investigating the circumstances of her injuries.\n\nIn Washington, President Joe Biden said U.S. forces helped Israel down \u201cnearly\nall\u201d the drones and missiles and pledged to convene allies to develop a\nunified response.\n\nThe Iranian attack, less than two weeks after a suspected Israeli strike in\nSyria that killed two Iranian generals in an Iranian consular building, marked\nthe first time Iran has launched a direct military assault on Israel, despite\ndecades of enmity dating back to the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nCondemnation from the United Nations chief and others was swift, with France\nsaying Iran \u201cis risking a potential military escalation,\u201d Britain calling the\nattack \u201creckless\u201d and Germany saying Iran and its proxies \u201cmust stop it\nimmediately.\u201d\n\nHagari said the vast majority of the intercepts came outside Israel\u2019s borders,\nincluding 10 cruise missiles that were intercepted by warplanes.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Iron Dome air defense system launches to intercept missiles fired\nfrom Iran, in central Israel, Sunday, April 14, 2024.

Asked whether\nIsrael would respond, Hagari said only that the army \u201cdoes and will do\nwhatever is required to protect the security of the state of Israel.\u201d He said\nthe incident was not over, and dozens of Israeli warplanes remained in the\nskies.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military said its Arrow system, which shoots down ballistic missiles\noutside the atmosphere, handled most interceptions and noted that \u201cstrategic\npartners\u201d were involved.\n\n\u201cAt my direction, to support the defense of Israel, the U.S. military moved\naircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the\ncourse of the past week,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cThanks to these\ndeployments and the extraordinary skill of our service members, we helped\nIsrael take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles.\u201d\n\nAn Iranian demonstrator chants slogans while attending an anti-Israeli\ngathering at the Felestin (Palestine) Square in Tehran, Iran, early Sunday,\nApril 14, 2024.

(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi)\n\nIsrael\u2019s multilayered air-defense system protected it from Iran\u2019s drone and\nmissile strike\n\nUS helps Israel shoot down \u2018nearly all\u2019 Iran-launched attack drones as Biden\nvows support\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a separate statement that U.S.\nforces \u201cintercepted dozens of missiles and UAVs en route to Israel, launched\nfrom Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\u201d\n\nBiden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke early Sunday,\nIsraeli time, their governments said. Biden said in his statement that he\nreaffirmed \u201cAmerica\u2019s ironclad commitment\u201d to Israel\u2019s security \u2014 a departure\nfrom his growing criticism of Israel\u2019s conduct in its war on Hamas in Gaza.\n\nIran had vowed revenge since the April 1 airstrike in Syria, which Tehran\naccused Israel of being responsible for. Israel hasn\u2019t commented on it.\n\nIsrael and Iran have been on a collision course throughout Israel\u2019s six-month\nwar against Hamas militants in Gaza. The war erupted after Hamas and Islamic\nJihad, two militant groups backed by Iran, carried out a devastating cross-\nborder attack on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250\nothers. An Israeli offensive in Gaza has caused widespread devastation and\nkilled over 33,000 people, according to local health officials.\n\nAlmost immediately after the war erupted, Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed\nmilitant group in Lebanon, began attacking Israel\u2019s northern border. The two\nsides have been involved in daily exchanges of fire, while Iranian-backed\ngroups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen have launched rockets and missiles toward\nIsrael.\n\nIn a statement carried late Saturday by Iran\u2019s state-run IRNA news agency, the\ncountry\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard acknowledged launching \u201cdozens of\ndrones and missiles towards the occupied territories and positions of the\nZionist regime.\u201d\n\nIn a later statement, the Revolutionary Guard issued a direct warning to the\nU.S.: \u201cThe terrorist U.S. government is warned any support or participation in\nharming Iran\u2019s interests will be followed by decisive and regretting response\nby Iran\u2019s armed forces.\u201d\n\nIRNA also quoted an anonymous official saying ballistic missiles were part of\nthe attack. A ballistic missile moves on an arch trajectory, heading up into\nspace before gravity brings the weapon down at a speed several times faster\nthan the speed of sound.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel\u2019s defenses are\nready after Iran launched dozens of drones and ballistic missiles on Saturday.\n\nIsrael has a multilayered air-defense network that includes systems capable of\nintercepting a variety of threats including long-range missiles, cruise\nmissiles, drones and short-range rockets. However, in a massive attack\ninvolving multiple drones and missiles, the likelihood of a strike making it\nthrough is higher.\n\nIran has a vast arsenal of drones and missiles. Online videos shared by\nIranian state television purported to show delta-wing-style drones resembling\nthe Iranian Shahed-136s long used by Russia in its war on Ukraine. The slow-\nflying drones carry bombs. Ukraine has successfully used both surface-to-air\nmissiles and ground fire to target them.\n\nSome Israelis watched the interceptions light up the night sky.\n\nAir raid sirens were reported in numerous places including northern Israel,\nsouthern Israel, the northern West Bank and the Dead Sea near the Jordanian\nborder.\n\nIsrael\u2019s army ordered residents in the Golan Heights \u2014 near the Syrian and\nLebanese borders \u2014 as well as the southern towns of Nevatim and Dimona and the\nRed Sea resort of Eilat into protective spaces. Dimona is home to Israel\u2019s\nmain nuclear facility, and Nevatim has a major air base. Loud booms were heard\nin Jerusalem and northern and southern Israel.\n\nThe army\u2019s Home Front Command canceled school Sunday and limited public\ngatherings to no more than 1,000 people. Israel and some other countries in\nthe region closed their airspace.\n\nEarlier, Netanyahu warned: \u201cWhoever harms us, we will harm them.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, Biden convened a principals meeting of the National Security\nCouncil to discuss the attack.\n\nGen. Erik Kurilla, the head of the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, was in\nIsrael over the weekend consulting with Israeli defense officials. The Central\nCommand oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East.\n\nIran\u2019s mission to the United Nations issued a warning to both Israel and the\nU.S. \u201cShould the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran\u2019s response will be\nconsiderably more severe,\u201d it wrote online. \u201cIt is a conflict between Iran and\nthe rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!\u201d\n\nFor days, Iranian officials including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\nhad threatened to \u201cslap\u201d Israel for the Syria strike.\n\nIn Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, witnesses saw long lines at gas stations early\nSunday as people appeared worried about what may come next. Dozens of hard-\nliners demonstrated in support of the attack at Palestine Square.\n\nLebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency reported heavy Israeli airstrikes and\nshelling on multiple locations in south Lebanon following Iran\u2019s launch of\ndrones. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched \u201cdozens\u201d of\nKatyusha rockets at an Israeli military site in the Golan Heights early\nSunday. It was not immediately clear if there was any damage.\n\nIranian missiles or drones were intercepted in the sky above the Jordanian\ncapital, Amman. In Lebanon\u2019s capital, Beirut, and elsewhere in the country,\nresidents reported seeing missiles in the sky and hearing explosions, likely\nfrom interceptions. In Syria, explosions were heard in the capital, Damascus,\nand elsewhere. Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human\nRights reported that Syrian air defenses tried to shoot down Israeli attempts\nto intercept Iranian missiles.\n\n## ___\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
