The books are structured as a series of dreams\nin which Mr Tompkins enters alternative worlds where the physical constants\nhave radically different values from those they have in the real world. Gamow\naims to use these changes to explain modern scientific theories.\n\nMr Tompkins' adventures begin when he chooses to spend the afternoon of a bank\nholiday attending a lecture on the theory of relativity. The lecture proves\nless comprehensible than he had hoped. He drifts off to sleep and enters a\ndream world in which the speed of light is a mere 4.5 m/s (10 mph). This\nbecomes apparent to him as passing cyclists are subject to a noticeable\nLorentz\u2013FitzGerald contraction. Mr Tompkins becomes acquainted with the\nprofessor delivering the lectures and ultimately marries the professor's\ndaughter, Maud. Later chapters in the books deal with atomic structure (Mr\nTompkins spends time as a conduction electron, returning to consciousness when\nhe is annihilated in an encounter with a positron), and thermodynamics (the\nProfessor expounds an analogy between the second law of thermodynamics and the\nbias towards a gambling casino before being confounded by a local reversal of\nthe second law through the intervention of Maxwell's demon who has introduced\nhimself to Maud in one of her dreams). Mr Tompkins' initials are 'C.G.H.'\nwhich stand for c (the speed of light), G (the constant of gravitation) and h\n(Planck's constant). Following their marriage Maud refers to him as 'Cyril'.\n\nLater books in the series tackled biology and advanced cosmology.\n\nIn 2010 the first volume of a proposed ten-issue comic book series, The\nAdventures of Mr. Tompkins, was created by George Gamow's son Igor, and\nillustrator Scorpio Steele. Here Tompkins learns about relativity from Albert\nEinstein, radioactivity from Marie Curie and the structure of the atom from\nErnest Rutherford. A second volume, in which Tompkins meets Charles Darwin,\nGregor Mendel and James Watson, was published in July 2011.\n\nMain belt asteroid 12448 Mr. Tompkins is named after Tompkins.^[1]\n\nThe Scientific Background to the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry begins by\nciting Mr Tompkins Inside Himself.^[2]\n\nThe University of Akron produced a film adaption of this story starring Prof.\nAlan Neville Gent, which is available on YouTube: here.\n\n## Books in the series[edit]\n\n  * 1940: Mr Tompkins in Wonderland, originally published 1938 in serial form in Discovery magazine (UK)\n  * 1945: Mr Tompkins Explores the Atom\n  * 1965: Mr Tompkins in Paperback, combines Mr Tompkins in Wonderland with Mr Tompkins Explores the Atom\n  * 1953: Mr Tompkins Learns the Facts of Life, about biology\n  * 1967: Mr. Tompkins Inside Himself, coauthor Martynas Y\u010das revised Mr Tompkins Learns the Facts of Life giving a broader view of biology, including recent developments in molecular biology\n  * 1993: Canto edition Mr Tompkins in Paperback, foreword by Roger Penrose, Cambridge University Press\n  * 1999: The New World of Mr Tompkins, coauthor Russell Stannard updated Mr Tompkins in Paperback (ISBN 9780521630092 hardcover)\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"JPL Small-Body Database Browser\".
