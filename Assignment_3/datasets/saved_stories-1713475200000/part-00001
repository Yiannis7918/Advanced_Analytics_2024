Not for Us!\n\n  * 18 April 2024\n  * 237\n\nViews\n\n  * 13 Comments\n\nI feel like generative AI is everywhere these days. When I create a video on\nStreamYard, it asks me if I want its AI to create a thumbnail. When I compose\na newsletter on Mailchimp, it prompts me with an option to write the message\nwith AI. And so on.\n\nFrankly, I\u2019m not interested.\n\nStonemaier Games does not, has not, and will not use any form of generative AI\nto replace or augment creative work. If we\u2019re creating something, we want it\nbuilt from the ground up by talented people from different backgrounds,\nperspectives, and cultures, not an algorithm.\n\nDespite that commitment, I also admit that AI has impacted Stonemaier Games\nfor years, as our digital games feature AI opponents. Have you played Scythe\nDigital, Wingspan Digital, Charterstone Digital, or others? Odds are that you\nplayed against the AI. Not really generative AI, but certainly in the same\nrealm.\n\nWith this in mind, I recently polled Stonemaier Ambassadors to see how they\u2019re\nfeeling about generative AI. I first asked about their general response to\ngenerative AI in tabletop games:\n\nThese results surprised me a bit\u2013I expected more people to strongly oppose the\nuse of generative AI, especially with recent uproar about Terraforming Mars\nand the new version of Puerto Rico. Yet this is somewhat in line with what\nI\u2019ve seen about eco-friendliness: about a third of people like the idea of it,\nbut the quality of the game comes first.\n\nIt\u2019s also notable, however, that only 8% of respondents said with no\ndisclaimers that they support the use of generative AI.\n\nI asked about this before making our stance clear in the question that\nfollowed:\n\nI don\u2019t think a single person said that they strongly believe we should use\ngenerative AI (though around 7% of people said that our approach might be\nshort-sighted). The answer I was most curious about was to see if some\nambassadors thought our stance wasn\u2019t firm enough, and a few people fall into\nthat camp.\n\nSpecifically, I was talking about a future where you can feed a near-final\nprototype into an AI playtest bot and have it spit out 10,000 games\u2019 worth of\ndata in a few minutes. I don\u2019t see this as replacing human playtesters at all,\nbut it could be helpful for identifying circumstantial, niche, and asymmetric\nimbalances.\n\nNone of this changes our overall stance on generative AI, but it\u2019s good food\nfor thought, as is the following:\n\n  * Privilege: We can proudly say that we pay artists for the creation of hundreds of illustrations in a single game (Wyrmspan, for example, has over 230 unique illustrations by Clementine Campardou), but what about a first-time designer looking to self publish their game on a shoestring budget? Generative AI is far from the only option, but I can understand why it might offer a different value proposition to that creator than to Stonemaier Games.\n  * Prototype Art: When I was designing Viticulture in 2011 and 2012, I added some temporary placeholder photos from Google Image searches to the playtest prototypes so they wouldn\u2019t look so plain. Is it any different for a designer to use generative AI to add a little flavor to their prototype? While it isn\u2019t \u201cart\u201d that we would ever use, I don\u2019t mind if someone submits a prototype like this.\n  * Search Engines: A few months ago we experimented with the addition of a site-specific search engine with an AI foundation. I found it more helpful than a Google search to unearth and summarize older articles on various topics\u2013I\u2019ve written these twice-weekly articles since late 2012, so there\u2019s a lot of text to dig through. Ultimately the search engine\u2019s plugin messed too much with the coding of our website, so we removed it.\n\nWhile I\u2019m truly not interested in having AI generate art or text for anything\nwe make at Stonemaier Games, I\u2019m interested in the gray areas like those I\nmention above: AI opponents in digital games, brute-force playtesting,\nprivilege, prototypes, search engines, and beyond. I\u2019d love to hear your\nthoughts in the comments!\n\n***\n\nIf you gain value from the 100 articles Jamey publishes on this blog each\nyear, please consider championing this content!

Laszlo Korossy says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 10:43 am\n\nJust the opposite of shortsighted \u2014 to be shortsighted is to jump into using\nAI with both feet at this early stage without a second thought of what it\ncosts and what it replaces.\n\nBut I saw Jason Tagmire (of Button Shy Games) comment on this thread on Reddit\nregarding the use of AI-generated art in prototypes, and he had some\ninteresting points that I don\u2019t think I would have thought of on my own (and\nfor which he was subsequently downvoted):\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1c199m0/comment/kz1ygso/\n\nI\u2019d be interested to know your thoughts.\n\nReply\n\n  2. Evan Kline says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 10:21 am\n\nI can definitely see AI as a benefit in rulebook editing. Quickly identifying\ncontradictions, missing explanations, etc. Or even translating (or at least\nspeeding up the process) to other languages.\n\nAnother use case: a friend of mine is tinkering with rulebook specific chat-\nbots. Instead of searching through the index, just asking the question you\nhave in plain english and having an AI instantly provide the answer. Not just\nthe location of the specific rule, but a contextual reply based on the AI\u2019s\nunderstanding of the rulebook as a whole and your specific question.\n\nA third use case: I do think there\u2019s a world that\u2019s not too far away where AI\nopponents can exist in a (mostly) analog game.\n\nThis isn\u2019t something I want to build myself, but I want it to exist, so\nplease, someone steal the idea from me: Multi-modal AI\u2019s have started rolling\nout (can process different types of information at the same time: image, text,\naudio, etc.).\n\nYou would need some digital tool to interact with (like a smartphone). But I\ncan imagine an AI opponent that can view a game state via a picture of a board\n(or a constant video feed of a smartphone on some kind of holder), be trained\non the rulebook (that perhaps an AI has already edited so you know it\u2019s\ntight), and communicate what the AI player does in plain english (or any\nlanguage).\n\nThere would be some interesting things to figure out, like different forms of\nhidden information (hands of cards, points, resources, etc), certain kinds of\nplayer interaction like trading. But at a high level, definitely seems\npossible.\n\nI don\u2019t think this would just be for solo players either. Most games have what\nplayers consider to be the \u201coptimal player count.\u201d Having a plug and play\nextra opponent to fill out 1 or 2 spots in that Twilight Imperium game when\nyou could only wrangle up 3 other people could be pretty nice.\n\nReply\n\n  3. Pat Johanns says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 10:15 am\n\nHi, I have a point of view in which I have been researching and writing a book\nabout AI for the last 9 months. I am also helping a friend create a game. Here\nis where I have felt the use of generative AI to be useful and ethical in my\ngame creation experiences. 1. Identifying unclear aspects of the rules. It\nalso suggest alternative wordings which we consider. 2. Generate ideas for\npersonal goals. We had a list of 8 personal goals to use in the game. The AI\ngenerated about 8 more. Four or five of which had merit. So, it helped spark\nideas. 3. Suggest alternative names for the game. It came up with some good\ngames but she liked her original name. 4. Create a Playtest form for the game.\n5. Determine the appropriate age-level for the game. 6. Suggest which aspects\nof the game might be candidates to simplify the game by moving those aspects\nto an expansion or advanced version. 7. We submitted the game to the Playtest\nand Win event at Geekway. We used the AI to help revise the sell sheet.\n\nGenerative AI can have a place in the creative process but the person using it\nneeds to have content knowledge to assess the responses from the AI. I would\nbe happy to discuss this topic further by email or at Geekway.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Jamey Stegmaier says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 10:24 am\n\nThanks for sharing, Pat! It\u2019s an interesting list and I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found it\nuseful, but for each entry I can\u2019t help but wonder why? Why use AI to create a\nplaytest form when I could have create the form myself? Why use AI to suggest\nnames when I could brainstorm them with people? And so on.\n\nReply\n\n  4. Elden says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 9:50 am\n\nAs an amateur game designer, several of my friends refused to try out one of\nmy designs because it didn\u2019t look nice (I don\u2019t understand that stance but\naccept it) since then I\u2019ve tried to gussy them up a bit. Usually with free art\nor pictures I gather from the internet because, this cannot be overstated, I\nam not an artist.\n\nI have a design I\u2019ve been working on for the last year that I think has\npotential, the theme is kind of odd and a somewhat original idea, and finding\nappropriate images that really conveyed what I was leaning into don\u2019t exist.\nSo I turned to generative AI to help sell the idea, and I don\u2019t feel bad about\nit, I was never going to pay an artist at this stage, and was likely to\nsteal...err borrow...an image anyway.\n\nI do put a disclaimer that the art is AI, for prototype purposes only and not\nIntended for publication.\n\nReply\n\n  5. Jeremy Berven says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 9:47 am\n\nAs someone who integrates AI tools into my daily work activities. Can you\nconfidently say that the artists you\u2019re paying for illustrations, in no way,\nuse any AI to assist them? Do no illustrators in the board gaming industry use\nAdobe\u2019s AI tools to assist them in generating ideas or repeat a complex\npattern? I\u2019d bed 90% of them do and don\u2019t advertise it, because it truly\ndoesn\u2019t matter. The end state of the illustration is still theirs to own and\ndeliver at a high quality even if the AI helped them generate ideas and/or\npart of the illustration. Why wouldn\u2019t someone use AI to help them do their\njob better if it meant more work for them long term?\n\nTerraforming mars even stated it in their interview that they use AI \u201cin\nconjunction with our internal and external illustrators, graphic designers,\nand marketers to generate ...\u201d and \u201cour use of AI is not to replicate in any\nway the works of an individual creator\u201d. Simply stating that AI use in an\nindustry is bad for everyone is a pretty harsh/vague stigma.\n\nI highly recommend that individual artists use AI tools in any way they can to\ncome up with and create a quality product. What I am against is replacing an\nartist with an AI generator (which is unfortunately not the question that was\nasked).\n\nReply\n\n    1. Jamey Stegmaier says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 9:49 am\n\nContractually, our artists cannot use AI for any illustrations they create for\nStonemaier Games projects.\n\nReply\n\n  6. Benny Sperling says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 9:30 am\n\nNot for my company either. I also won\u2019t support companies that are choosing to\ngo down that path.\n\nReply\n\n  7. Mark H says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 9:22 am\n\nThe pitch for \u201cMicrosoft copilot\u201d is that it is a copilot \u2013 not an autopilot.\nSo if you wanted to ask AI to write your next blog post, for example, the idea\nis you wouldn\u2019t just generate content and click send. You would use AI to\ngenerate the post, then review and edit it into something presentable that\nworks for you. So at the end of the day you could reasonably claim it as\n\u201cyour\u201d content.\n\nThere are probably books that could be written on human psychology when it\ncomes to AI. I used it to write a poem just for fun and felt a wierd sense of\nownership of the poem as presented, with no changes. After all, it was my\nprompt that caused the poem to be created. Plus, I know humans are lazy and\nthe majority aren\u2019t going to apply the necessary time and attention that is\nneeded to refine AI generated content into something that is \u201ctheirs\u201d.\n\nI probably don\u2019t know enough about AI to even be commenting, but it is going\nahead whether we participate or not. There may be business risks either way\nwhether we choose to be a part of it or choose to avoid it. But I fully\nsupport Stonemaier\u2019s stance on this one.\n\nThis comment generated by AI. Just kidding, it\u2019s all me.\n\nReply\n\n  8. Karel says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 9:10 am\n\nCame here to say the same as Christopher: AI opponents in a digital game are\nsomething completely different than generative AI. Whether you are playing\nagainst a deck of Automa cards in a solo game or against a computer in a\ndigital game: you are playing against an ARTIFICIAL opponent who will not make\nrandom moves but will try to do smart things, hence the name \u201cINTELLIGENT\u201d. It\nis perfectly okay to call an Automa deck of cards \u201can A.I. opponent\u201d, even\nthough hundreds and hundreds of human hours went into the creation of that\ndeck. Same with computer opponents: as Christopher said, they are programmed\nby people who know the game. If you are sending all your mechs in Scythe\ntowards a computer opponent, that opponent should \u201cknow\u201d that you are planning\nto attack it, and it should act upon that knowledge.\n\nThis has nothing to do with the generative AI as ChatGPT or the image\ngenerators. Those AI systems are black boxes that are trained on thousands and\nthousands of texts and images from real people. Nobody knows or understands\nhow the GenAI algorithms work, and the output is based on the creative work of\nothers, which makes copyright very shady.\n\nThe first form of AI is a form of AI that was crafted with love by real\nhumans, and it\u2019s okay to embrace it. The second form of AI is to be used with\ncaution, because of the copyright mist, and because of the enormous ecological\nimpact of those calculations.\n\nReply\n\n  9. Wonmin Lee (Pegasus Games) says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 9:08 am\n\nI\u2019m also in the camp of \u201cgenerative AI is okay for faster prototyping\u201d\n\nI know it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal but I always feel iffy whenever I show up\nwith handwritten index cards and ask people for their precious time\nplaytesting my game. If I can mitigate this with slightly nicer AI generated\nimages, then I think that\u2019s fine.\n\nReply\n\n  10. Christopher Elliott says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 8:58 am\n\nI don\u2019t see AI opponents in the same category by default, a good AI is\nprogrammed with scripts, environmental conditions, etc. that are unique to\nyour program. Generative AI is not unique, it uses existing examples to output\n(imo its main \u201cethical\u201d issue).\n\nConcerning playtesting, if you are doing it on your own game design, your use\nof generative AI will be limited since the conditions of the playtest will be\nunique. So in other words, you are going to need to create NEW code to\nproperly playtest with AI. You could perhaps use generative AI for some basic\nfunctions depending on your scope/design, i.e. API calls that sort of thing.\n\nI think generative AI could be really useful for prototypes. I have used that\nin my RPG session build outs. Gets my creative juices flowing. But it could be\neasy to cross a line after using it for a while.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Jamey Stegmaier says:\n\nApril 18, 2024 at 9:06 am\n\nThanks for your thoughts on this topic! I agree that AI scripts for digital\ngames are in a different category, but I wanted to be transparent about the\ngray areas of this topic. :)\n\nReply\n\nSee All Comments\n\n  * #### Search\n\n  * #### Subscribe to Blog via Email\n\nJoin 64.8K other subscribers\n\n  * #### Recent Posts\n\n    * Generative AI?
