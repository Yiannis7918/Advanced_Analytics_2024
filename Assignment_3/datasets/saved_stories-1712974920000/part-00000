It was initially proposed to\nmonitor the gamma radioactivity outcoming from steel drums containing cemented\nradwaste, even though it could be usefully employed in a wider range of\napplications. Gamma rays are penetrating and convey information from the\ndrum's internal structure, as the count rate measured on the surface depends\non the thickness and density of the crossed materials.

Introduction\n\nThe PREDIS (predisposal management of radioactive waste) Euratom project is\naimed at the development and implementation of activities for the predisposal\ntreatment of radioactive waste streams other than nuclear fuel and high-level\nradioactive waste [1]. Within Work Package 7, the project contemplates testing\nand evaluating innovative tools and techniques in cemented waste handling and\npredisposal storage and, in particular, to demonstrate the feasibility of\nmedium-to-long-term monitoring by means of low-cost radiation sensors to be\ninstalled around the radwaste drums as an alternative to more conventional\nprocedures by operators [2]. A periodic automatic check of the radiation\nlevels around radwaste drums could represent an added value with respect to\nsafety and security, with recorded streams of count rate data providing a\nuseful tool for the early detection of possible anomalies or tampering with\nthe drums. The enhancement in terms of transparency is noteworthy as well\n[3,4,5].\n\nNeutron [6] and gamma [7] radiation sensors for radwaste drum monitoring have\nalready been developed and have proven feasible within the EU MICADO project\n[8]. However, the use of a wired online monitoring configuration for a real\nradwaste storage site would be a limitation, and this is why a wireless\nsolution should be aimed at addressing the issue in [9]. In this paper, we\ndescribe the development of a wireless sensor, featuring a gamma-ray counter\nand a compact front-end and data acquisition electronics box, to be easily\ninstalled on a drum. The same gamma sensor of ref. [7] was employed, based on\na scintillating fiber [10] whose output light is collected by a Silicon\nPhotoMultiplier (SiPM) [11,12,13,14,15] photosensor at each end. The two SiPMs\nare connected to two newly developed amplifiers, followed by analog-to-digital\nconverters controlled by an Expressif ESP32 microcontroller [16]. Each box,\noperated on batteries, is connected wirelessly to a private sub-network\nexposed by a WiFi router and can be set to sleep and woken up for measurement\nperiodically or on demand by means of a Low Energy Bluetooth link. A PC/Server\nwith facilities for electronics and data management is also connected to the\nsame sub-network.\n\nFollowing a set of bench tests with low-activity laboratory sources, a\ndemonstration was set up at UJV-REZ to prove the feasibility and validity of\nour solution. A suitable cemented mockup was built to insert a high-activity\ngamma source and test the sensors in a realistic environment. In Section 2, we\ndescribe the detector, front-end electronics, data acquisition, transmission,\nlaboratory tests, and software features, along with the cemented mockup\nstructure and its related simulation. In Section 3, we describe the system\ndemonstration, i.e., the installation setup and tuning, and finally, the\nmeasurement results.\n\n## 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n#### 2.1. The Detector\n\nEach detection unit consists of a Scintillating Fiber (SciFi) gamma-ray\ndetector [7] coupled to its front-end electronics and data acquisition and\ntransmission, which are allocated inside a dedicated box. The SciFi features a\n3-mm-diameter and 80-cm long scintillating optical fiber [10] coupled at each\nend to a MicroFC-30035-SMT SiPM produced by ON Semiconductor [11]. A SciFi\nunit is shown in Figure 1, with the logical operating principle sketched in\nFigure 2. The typical amplitude spectra of the signals from the SiPMs at the\ntwo ends of a SciFi sensor are shown in Figure 3. The scintillation light\nproduced by the fiber, when exposed to a gamma-ray source, gives rise to the\nmulti-peak structure reflecting the discrete numbers of detected photons\n[12,13,14,15]. A suitable threshold set on the discriminators, along with the\nrequired coincidence between the signals at the two detector ends, suppresses\nthe spurious noise [7]. The large peak around channel 350 is due to the\nsaturation of the amplifier and does not represent a problem as the SciFi is\njust a radiation counter.\n\nFigure 1. The SciFi detector, consisting of a 3-mm-diameter and 80-cm long\nscintillating fiber coupled at each end to a SiPM, enclosed in an aluminum\npipe.\n\nFigure 2. Sketch of the logical operating principle of a SciFi gamma-ray\ndetector.\n\nFigure 3. Typical amplitude spectra of the signals from the SiPMs at the two\nends of a SciFi sensor. See the text for details.\n\n#### 2.2. Front-End Electronics\n\nThe main guidelines for the development of the readout electronics board were\nas follows:\n\n  * Modularity, allowing for easy maintenance and the possibility to use the same electronics, with minor modifications, coupled to different detectors and in different scenarios.\n\n  * Low power consumption, obtained by choosing proper components and keeping the system in sleeping mode as long as possible, except during the measurement and data transmission phases.\n\n  * Low cost, by employing common components present on the market and reducing, when possible, the Research & Development costs.\n\nThe treatment of the analog signals coming from the detector has been demanded\nto a separate mezzanine board (Figure 4a) handling two input channels. Each\nchannel contains the following in sequence:\n\nFigure 4. (a) The detector interface board (front-end board). (b) Block scheme\nof the board.\n\n  * Charge-sensitive pre-amplifier CREMAT CR-110 rev.2.01.\n\n  * High-pass filter.\n\n  * Shaper CREMAT CR-200-1\u03bcs.\n\n  * Attenuator with a factor of 0.05.\n\n  * Base-line restorer circuit (\u03c4 \u2248 700 \u03bcs).\n\nFollowing that, each line is split in two. On one side, there is a threshold\ndiscriminator, with a threshold ranging from 0 mV to 4096 mV, with a 1 mV\nresolution; on the other side, there is a resettable Peak and Hold circuit,\nfollowed by a 14-bit programmable SAR ADC that is high-speed and single-supply\n(Texas Instruments ADS8675). A block scheme of the front-end board is shown in\nFigure 4b.\n\nThe signals on the two channels are analyzed individually and, when they are\nabove the selected threshold, counted separately. Moreover, if they occur in\ncoincidence within a time window of 2 \u03bcs, these events are counted as well,\nand their amplitudes are converted to digital and acquired. The single channel\ncounters provide indications about the operation of the SiPMs and their noise\nlevel, while the coincidence counter provides the number of physical radiation\ndetection events.\n\nThe bias voltage for the two SiPMs is common and supplied by an EMCO DC-DC\nconverter (AG02P-5) capable of providing a floating voltage ranging from 0 to\n200 V. In our case, we set the full scale to 50 V and used a 12-bit DAC to\ngenerate the desired voltage. In order to reduce the power consumption, the\nbias voltage is set and measured after wake-up directly at the DC-DC converter\noutput by means of a 12-bit ADC, with a resolution of the order of 0.1% or\nless. Some filters were added to clean the output bias.\n\nBoth the mezzanine front-end board and the bias module are mounted on sockets\non the main board, ensuring a quick and easy replacement in case of failure or\nto be employed with other kinds of detectors.\n\n#### 2.3. Data Acquisition and Transmission\n\nThe main board contains a microcontroller ESP32 (Espressif ESP32-WROVER-E),\nfeaturing a 3.3 V power supply, 240 MHz Dual Core CPU, 520 kB SRAM, 8 MB flash\nmemory, and 8 MB PSRAM (both Quad SPI), devoted to the management of all the\nfeatures related to the data collection and transmission. We opted for a\nsystem having built-in WiFi capability (802.11 b/g/n up to 150 Mbps), adding\nto the main board a separate module for the cabled Ethernet connection (WIZnet\nWIZ820io). The system has been designed to be constantly in standby mode in\norder to minimize the power consumption. The system wake-up for the scheduled\nmeasurements is obtained by means of a Real-Time Clock (RTC Maxim Integrated\nDS3231) mounted on a socket on the main board and is completely programmable.\nIn the present configuration, following each measurement, the system\nestablishes a WiFi contact with the PC/Server, uploads the data files,\ndownloads the possibly modified scheduling for the next measurements, and\nreturns to standby mode.\n\nThis automatic procedure can be overcome, whenever necessary, by sending a\nBluetooth wake-up signal to the ESP32. In such a case, a forced system wake-up\noccurs, which starts an immediate measurement and connects the system to the\nPC/Server for further instructions. To make this possible, a Low Energy\nBluetooth module (Microchip Technology Inc., RN4870/71-BLE) was installed on\nthe main board. This component always remains active, with a negligible power\nconsumption of the order of a few \u03bcW. In case of different future needs, the\nsystem modularity will allow the replacement of this BLE, currently limited to\na maximum distance of 10\u201320 m, with different wake-up circuits having higher\nperformances.\n\nThe ESP32 also demanded the control of the DACs to set the discriminator\nthresholds and the detector bias, the read-out of two temperature sensors\nplaced on the main board and on the mezzanine interface board, and the data\nstorage on the micro-SD memory card. The SPI protocol was used for the\ncommunication between the ESP32 and the other devices, except for the RTC,\nwhich communicates via the I2C protocol. The ESP32 firmware was developed\nusing the Wiring language. Figure 5 shows the main board with the indication\nof the main components; the piggy-back front-end board is visible as well.\nFigure 6 shows the block scheme of the different devices on the board\nconnected to the ESP32 and managed by it.\n\nFigure 5.

(l) Voltage\nbias to SciFi. (m) SciFi signal inputs. (n) Charge-sensitive pre-amplifiers.\n\nFigure 6. Block scheme of the main board with the interactions between the\nvarious devices and the microcontroller.\n\nThe installation of this kind of configuration was found to be quite simple.\nMoreover, with minor software modifications, the employed ESP32\nmicrocontroller could be easily adapted to different systems as stand-alone\ndevices or as nodes of a more open configuration in an IoT (Internet-of-\nThings) environment or a Mesh-Network architecture.\n\nThe average current absorbed by the system during the measurement cycles and\nduring the standby phase is 350 mA and 40 \u03bcA, respectively. As for the battery\npack, allocated inside the electronics box below the main board, we employed\neight type-C Ni-MH standard rechargeable batteries, each with a 5000 mAh\nnominal charge and 1.2 V output voltage. The eight batteries were connected as\na series of two groups of four in parallel to provide a total nominal voltage\nof 4.8 V and a charge of 10,000 mAh.\n\nThe weight of the electronics box is about 1.5 kg (essentially due to the\nbattery pack), and a picture with the indication of the overall dimensions is\nreported in Figure 7. The three connectors on the side are for the SiPM common\nvoltage bias and the two signal outputs. On the other side, there is a three-\nposition switch: power off, power on with battery, and power on via USB port\n(not visible in Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7. The electronics box containing front-end electronics, data\nacquisition and transmission hardware, ESP32 microcontroller, and batteries.\n\n#### 2.4. Test with a Laboratory Source\n\nSeveral laboratory tests were performed using a calibration ^60Co gamma source\n(157 kBq activity) to assess the performances and the stability of the\nelectronics coupled to a SciFi detector. The source was a 1-mm-diameter grain\nencapsulated in a 20 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 2 mm^3 transparent plastic tablet. Figure 8a shows\nthe count rates measured in 365 runs, corresponding to one year, with one 60-s\nacquisition cycle per day. Three different radioactive level conditions were\ntested: background, near source (2 cm), and far source (80 cm). In Figure 8b,\nwe show the count rate as a function of the source-detector distance, with the\nbackground rate shown as a reference.\n\nFigure 8. (a) Count rates measured in 365 runs of 60 s of data acquisition.\nThree different radioactive level conditions were tested: background, 2-cm,\nand 80-cm distance. (b) Count rate as a function of the source-detector\ndistance. The background rate is indicated as a reference.\n\nIn Figure 9a we report the measured discriminator threshold (each value is the\ncentroid of the distribution of 400 measurements) versus the value set by the\nDAC up to 2 V. The behavior is perfectly linear. Figure 9b shows an example of\none such distribution, featuring a standard deviation of 4 \u03bcV.\n\nFigure 9. (a) Measured discriminator threshold versus value set on the DAC.\nEach point is the average of 400 measurements. The very small error bars are\ninside the symbols. (b) Example histogram of 400 threshold measurements and a\nGaussian fit.\n\nThe battery pack discharge was evaluated throughout 850 measurement cycles by\nmeasuring its output voltage, and the results are plotted in Figure 10. The\nduration of each cycle was 60 s of acquisition plus 50 s for setup,\nstabilization, and data transmission. Considering a frequency of one cycle per\nday, an autonomy of approximately 2.5 years is ensured before having to\nrecharge the battery pack.\n\nFigure 10. The battery pack output voltage as a function of the number of one-\nminute measurement cycles.\n\n#### 2.5. Firmware and Software Development\n\nThe ESP32 microcontroller exposes an HTTP server through which remote\ninstructions can be executed and parameters and wake-up alarms can be\nconfigured. The main features are briefly listed below.\n\n  * Dynamic device registration, allowing the registration of an unknown device.\n\n  * Programmatic parameter configuration, allowing the operator to define hardware and measurement parameters for each device interactively.\n\n  * Scheduling, where each device can measure at predefined times defined by one or more schedules.\n\n  * User Interface (UI), which allows an operator to interact with the devices and display all parameters.\n\nTo expose those features in a safe and reliable manner, a containerized\nFlask/Python application server is deployed through Docker, exposing an HTTP\napplication server and a front-end UI. These two services are accessible\nthrough a pre-configured Virtual Private Network (VPN). The interconnection\nscheme for the demonstration configuration installed at the UJV-REZ is shown\nin Figure 11. Four detection units were hung around a cemented mockup drum,\nwith a fifth one in an adjacent room for background measurement. All the\nunits, as well as the PC/Server, were connected to the local WiFi sub-network\ngenerated by a dedicated router with a public IP address on the UJV-REZ Local\nArea Network (LAN). The sub-network, and then the PC/Server and the five\ndetection units were accessible both locally and remotely via a VPN. Indeed,\nthis configuration enabled the authorized users to interact remotely with the\nserver and the detection units to download the acquired data and allowed for\npossible setup changes when needed. This was effectively performed from Italy\nthroughout the three-month test.\n\nFigure 11. The interconnection scheme for the demonstration configuration\ninstalled at the UJV-REZ (Prague).\n\n#### 2.6. The Mockup Drum\n\nIn the framework of the PREDIS WP7 project, a demonstration test was foreseen,\naimed at proving the feasibility of a medium-to-long term monitoring of\ncemented radwaste drums. A 200 L concrete mockup, 820 mm high with 571 mm\ndiameter and encased into a 1.2-mm thick galvanized steel drum, was built for\nthe test. Its structure, shown in Figure 12, was initially meant to allow for\nthe insertion of one or more radioactive sources in vertical holes running\nthrough the concrete cylinder\u2019s full height, externally giving rise to a non-\nuniform radiation field to be detected and measured. The non-uniformity was\nforeseen to characterize the behavior of the sensors in response to such a\nfield, showing that they would be capable of detecting asymmetries and/or\ndeviations from the average, should anomalies occur to a real drum so\nequipped. Due to logistic reasons, a single configuration was chosen for the\nfinal demo, with a 165 MBq ^137Cs gamma source placed into the quasi-central\nhole (A), and the drum was equipped with four SciFi sensors to monitor it\nduring a one-to-three-month period. We remark that at the end of the test\ncampaign, we discovered that the nominal SciFi positions were displaced from\nthe effective ones due to a slightly rotated positioning of the drum lid\nduring its hasty closure after inserting the high-activity source.\n\nFigure 12. (a) Top view of the mockup scheme; the four green circles (at\nnominal 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and 270\u00b0) indicate the position of the SciFi sensors,\nand the white rectangle and circles represent the vertical holes in the\nconcrete cylinder. (b) A top picture of the cemented mockup drum, with the lid\nremoved. (c) A 3D sketch of the mockup inside; part of the steel skin is\nhighlighted in yellow, the concrete is in grey, and the vertical holes are in\nlight grey.\n\n#### 2.7. Mockup Simulation\n\nThe mockup geometry of Figure 12 was reproduced in FLUKA [17], including the\nfour SciFi detectors around the drum. Then, 10^9 decays from the\nabovementioned ^137Cs gamma source were simulated, tracked, and scaled to the\nreal source activity, finally producing (i) a 3D map of the expected dose rate\ndistribution and (ii) the deposited energy spectra on the four SciFi fibers.\nFigure 13a shows the expected dose rate distribution on an XY cross-section at\nmid-height of the drum (40 cm < Z < 41 cm, Figure 13b). Figure 13c shows the\nexpected dose rate distribution on the drum\u2019s surface in 3D, with three\nscintillating fibers also visible. Figure 14a depicts the expected dose rate\ndistribution on a YZ cross-section with \u22123 cm < X < \u22121 cm, as indicated in\nFigure 14b. Figure 15a shows the expected dose rate distribution on an XZ\ncross-section with 1 cm < Y < 3 cm, as indicated in Figure 15b.\n\nFigure 13. (a) Expected dose distribution on an XY cross-section at mid-height\nof the drum (40 cm < Z < 41 cm), according to the FLUKA simulation of the 165\nMBq ^137Cs gamma source placed at the same height inside the quasi-central\nhole of the mockup. All dimensions are in cm. (b) Indication of the cross-\nsection plane. (c) Expected dose rate distribution on the drum surface in 3D.\nThree scintillating fibers are also visible.\n\nFigure 14.

(a) Expected dose rate distribution on an XZ cross-section at 1 cm\n< Y < 3 cm. (b) 3D representation of the expected dose rate distribution on\nthe drum surface; three scintillating fibers are also visible.\n\nTable 1 lists the dose rates measured with a handheld instrument (Thermo FH 40\nG-L10) at three different heights in the 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 positions. The simulated\ndose rates are also shown for comparison. In light of several unknown\nexperimental conditions (i.e., rough positioning of the handheld instrument\nfor the measurement, approximate positioning of the source inside the mockup,\nnon-perfect geometric features of the concrete mockup, and misalignment\nbetween sensors and inner holes), the agreement between simulated values and\nmeasured ones looks reasonable. Figure 16 shows the simulated deposited energy\nspectra for the four SciFi sensors. The expected count rate for each detector,\nindicated in the legend, was obtained by integrating each spectrum above the\nselected threshold.\n\nFigure 16. Simulation of the deposited energy spectra for the four SciFi\nsensors.\n\nTable 1. Simulated and measured dose rates at three different heights in the\n0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 positions around the drum. Also reported are the dose rates\nevaluated by means of the corresponding SciFi sensors (averaged along the\nlength). See Section 3.3.\n\n## 3\\. Results\n\n#### 3.1. System Installation\n\nAs already mentioned, due to logistic reasons mainly related to the high\nsource activity and the consequent radiation protection issues, along with the\nlimited access to the storage site and the mockup drum, we decided to run a\nsingle demonstration with the radioactive source inserted in the quasi-central\nhole. The four SciFi sensors were hung on the drum (along with other sensors\nnot discussed in this paper) and initially connected via wires for their\npreliminary setup and tuning, as shown in Figure 17a. Several drums filled\nwith concrete were placed beside and over the mockup (Figure 17b), and then,\nthe wires were disconnected and other drums with concrete were placed in front\n(Figure 18) in order to verify the signal transmission capability through such\na heavy shielding. An additional SciFi sensor was installed about six meters\naway in the adjacent room to measure the ambient background. The monitoring\nunits were connected to the private WiFi sub-network, as previously described,\nand their automatic wake-up was scheduled to occur every six hours, with a\nmeasurement time of 60 s. The acquired data were stored locally and sent to\nthe PC/Server and a cloud database for redundant storage.\n\nFigure 17. (a) The four SciFi sensors hooked to the drum, initially connected\nvia wires for preliminary setup and tuning. (b) Several drums, filled with\nconcrete, beside and over the mockup.\n\nFigure 18. The final demo configuration with other drums filled with concrete\nplaced in front of the mockup.\n\n#### 3.2. System Tuning\n\nThe sensors\u2019 parameters were preliminarily arranged by roughly comparing the\ncount rate produced by a low-intensity radioactive source with the ambient\nbackground. Data were collected over several days while several checks were\nperformed remotely on the sensors\u2019 behavior. The tuning was then refined,\nsetting the voltage bias at the recommended value of 27 V (corresponding to a\nSiPM overvoltage of about 2.5 V) and choosing a suitable threshold for all the\nSiPMs. The real data acquisition started on 17 November 2023.\n\nThe voltage bias was automatically measured at each sensor wake-up, and its\noverall average value is reported in Table 2 for the five sensors, along with\nthe uncertainty, given as the standard deviation of all measurements.\n\nTable 2. The voltage bias value set and the corresponding measured one for the\nfive sensors.\n\nIn the plots in Figure 3, one can see a peak around channel 350, which is due\nto the saturation of the amplifier, and this does not represent a problem.\nIndeed, for the detection of a gamma ray on a SciFi, one simply needs the\ncoincidence of the two signals above the threshold, irrespective of their\neffective amplitude. Due to the 80 cm fiber length and the \u03bb = 330 cm\nattenuation length [10], the maximum attenuation k experienced by the\nscintillation light when emitted close to one end is as follows:\n\nThis is the maximum ratio to be expected between the signals from the two\nup/down SiPMs. Indeed, due to the amplifier saturation, one would expect such\na ratio to be mostly close to 1. Typically, when using scintillator bars, one\ncan determine the impact position of the radiation event by event by using\nEquation (2).\n\nwhere B and A are the signal amplitudes measured at the two bar ends, Q is the\ninitial scintillation light intensity propagating in the two directions, L is\nthe bar length, \u03bb is the bar attenuation length, and z is the hit coordinate\nwith respect to the middle point of the bar [18]. The scintillator bars are\nusually wrapped with reflective foil in order to maximize the amount of\ntrapped light. Unfortunately, in a scintillating fiber with a round cross-\nsection, the amount of trapped light is \u22726% in each direction [19], and this,\ncombined with the SiPM photon detection efficiency, generally produces signals\nwith few detected photons in response to gamma-ray interactions [7].\nTherefore, due to the low photon statistics, the position resolution of a\nSciFi with such a technique is very poor. Moreover, the amplifier saturation\nfurther blurs the information. Nonetheless, from Equations (1) and (2) one\nwould expect the following:\n\nThis is shown in Figure 19 for events detected by the SciFi at 0\u00b0 with the\nSiPM thresholds set at two and four photons. One can easily see that the tails\nof the distribution, mainly due to the statistical fluctuations when the\nnumber of photons is small, are shortened by enforcing a proper threshold.\n\nFigure 19. Distribution of the event-by-event natural logarithm of the B/A\nratio of Equation (2), with SiPM thresholds at two and four photons,\nrespectively.\n\n#### 3.3. Measurement Results\n\nAt each sensor wake-up, the temperature inside the electronics box was\nmeasured. Since the wake-up was occurring every six hours, one can safely\nassume that the measured values correspond to the ambient temperature. The\ncollection of the measured values during a two-month period is reported in\nFigure 20 for the five sensors. One can observe small fluctuations, likely to\nbe ascribed to slight daily local changes or limited sensor precision, and a\nslower overall oscillation due to environmental temperature changes. A few\nsharp fluctuations observed in some cases could be attributed to electrical\nnoise on the temperature sensors or perhaps to perturbations produced by local\noperations performed by people in the vicinity of the drums.\n\nFigure 20. Temperature values measured in the storage room by the five\nsensors.\n\nThe count rate data of the five installed detectors, averaged over the sixty-\nsecond measuring time interval, are reported in Figure 21 as a function of\ntime. As expected, the behavior is relatively flat, but not completely flat\nbecause of some slight up-down drifts due to temperature changes. It is well\nknown that the SiPM breakdown voltage, and thus, its gain, has a small\ndependence on the temperature over a wide interval via a given linear\ncoefficient. However, in the observed temperature range, such a drift should\nhave been negligible. The drift was to be ascribed to the behavior of the\nanalog electronics (mainly the amplifiers) because they were operating at the\nambient temperature just after wake-up without reaching thermal equilibrium.\nNonetheless, a simplified approach was followed to compensate for the drift:\nfor each SciFi, we used the count rate measured on the first measurement day\nas a reference and linearly fitted its variation with decreasing temperature\nin the following fourteen days. The obtained coefficients were used to correct\nthe count rate into an effective one for every measured data point, and the\nresulting plot is shown in Figure 22. Unfortunately, due to a defective\ncontact on its battery pack, the sensor at 180\u00b0 stopped working just a few\ndays before the end of the test. We also observed that the background rate\n(the grey line in the plots) shows three sharp peaks, which can be explained\nas a pick-up of electrical noise. Indeed, the sensor was hung on a wall beside\nan electricity distribution panel where some big devices nearby were\nconnected.\n\nFigure 21. Raw count rate data of the five installed detectors.\n\nFigure 22. Count rate data after correction for temperature variations (see\ntext for details).\n\nThe average count rate values were roughly rescaled to corresponding dose\nrates for the five SciFi detectors following similar considerations as in ref.\n[7]. We remark that such a rescaling is rough because (i) the sensors are not\npoint-like and (ii) even though the source is point-like, the gamma rays are\nalso scattered by concrete and steel; therefore, the emission geometry is\ndiffuse. As a consequence, the estimated dose rates have to be considered as\nan average indication as they are distributed over the fiber length. Count and\ndose rates are listed in Table 3.\n\nTable 3. Average count rates and (roughly) corresponding dose rates for the\nfive SciFi detectors.\n\nBefore concluding the demonstration, we acquired data in several angular\npositions by displacing the 0\u00b0 sensor around the drum, thus discovering that\nits nominal position (and the other three) was shifted by about 4\u00b0 from the\ninitially assumed one in front of the rectangular hole. This is clearly\nvisible in Figure 23. The positions used for the simulation, and indicated in\nFigure 12, take into account such a displacement.\n\nFigure 23. Count rate data acquired in several positions around the nominal\n0\u00b0.\n\n## 4\\. Conclusions\n\nThe predisposal treatment of radioactive waste streams other than nuclear fuel\nand high-level radioactive waste usually involves a thorough radiological\ncharacterization of the packed drums. The time lapses before and after\ncharacterization could be somewhat long; therefore, monitoring the drums\nduring these phases could be useful for early discovery of possible anomalies.\nDue to its wireless and battery operation mode, as well as its hookwise\nmechanical fixing, the SciFi sensor has shown to be quickly and easily\ninstalled, positioned, displaced, and removed. Its programming flexibility\nmakes it possible to employ it for almost continuous measurements in the short\nterm, useful for radiation protection purposes, as well as for longer-term\ndaily measurements to check the overall integrity of drums in view of their\nfinal disposal. Tampering with, or unauthorized operations on, the drums could\nbe promptly detected as a sharp behavioral change of the count rate(s),\ntherefore providing an additional security benefit on top of the safety one.\nThe acquired data are stored locally on the SD memory card of each electronics\nbox and the PC/server. They are also automatically transmitted to a cloud\ndatabase for permanent archival storage, thus ensuring data integrity because\nof the multiple redundancy. We showed that a number of sensors arranged around\na drum (in the present case, four units) provide indications of the emission\nanisotropy, with any sensitive change in the measured count rate hinting at\nsome anomaly and possibly triggering a suitable inspection by operators.\n\nThe forthcoming activity with the sensors will be focused on the\ncharacterization of their anomaly detection capability by simulating several\nconfigurations like tiny cracks on the steel skin and/or on the concrete bulk\nand by planning specifically designed laboratory tests. An already planned\nimprovement of the electronics will be the implementation of LoRa [20], a\nbetter-performing lower-power and longer-range wireless connection.\n\nEven though the initial proposal in the PREDIS project was to monitor the\ngamma radioactivity from cemented radwaste drums, we are convinced that the\nSciFi devices described in this paper could be usefully employed in a wider\nrange of applications. Indeed, we are currently planning to employ them as\nlow-cost solutions for the safety/security of rooms and people in public\nplaces and to equip tents for in-field nuclear safeguards operations.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, P.F. and M.R.; methodology, P.F. and M.R.; electronics,\nP.D.M. and A.P.; software, P.D.M., A.P., C.P., and M.D.G.; validation, P.F.\nand M.R.; formal analysis, P.F. and M.R.; investigation, P.F., M.R., C.S., and\nA.D.; resources, P.F., M.R., K.P., and J.Z.; data curation, P.F., M.R., and\nM.D.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.F. and M.R.; writing\u2014review and\nediting, P.F. and M.R.; project administration, M.R.; funding acquisition,\nP.F. and M.R.
