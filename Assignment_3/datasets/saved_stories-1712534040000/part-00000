He is likewise insulted with the stings of insects, and the\n> poisonous bites of serpents; and he is often incommoded with impure and\n> useless creatures, which seem to exist for no other good purpose but to form\n> the shade between good and evil.\n\nThe human \u201cempire over the animals,\u201d Buffon said in summary, \u201cis not\nabsolute.\u201d His diagnosis was at once a material and an epistemological claim:\nThe physical attributes and behaviors of animals prevented them from being\nmastered, and their \u201cimpure\u201d characteristics made them impossible to confine\nin taxonomic or moral categories. For Buffon, some animal bodies would always\nbe able to hide in places inaccessible to humans, just as some animal\nidentities would remain out of intellectual reach, ensconced within \u201cthe shade\nbetween\u201d human classifications.\n\nThis idea that acquiring comprehensive knowledge of animals is impossible is\nabsent from many of today\u2019s histories of science, whose authors often assume\nthat Enlightenment-era naturalists sought complete mastery of the nonhuman\nworld. The \u201cdream of total knowledge in Christian natural history,\u201d writes\nhistorian James Delbourgo, was founded on the idea that \u201cthe universe had not\nchanged since the creation so naturalists could aspire to assemble complete\ncatalogues of natural kinds.\u201d But for Buffon, as for many of his\ncontemporaries, total knowledge was illusory because animals often refuse to\ncooperate with humans\u2019 grand classificatory efforts. As demonstrated by two\nrecent books\u2014Curious Species: How Animals Made Natural History, by science\nwriter and historian Whitney Barlow Robles, and The Tame and the Wild: People\nand Animals After 1492, by historian Marcy Norton\u2014animals have always had\nagency, and they have used it to complicate, participate in, and resist human\ndesigns.\n\nOver the last couple of decades, scholars studying the history of science have\nsought to amplify the category of the \u201cknowledge producer\u201d by giving\nattention, for example, not only to credentialed elites but also to\nmarginalized groups and subjects. Both Robles and Norton expand this project\nfurther, beyond the horizons of humanity, to present animals themselves as\n\u201cdrivers of historical change.\u201d They aim to bring nonhuman creatures in from\nthe margins of history. For Robles, that history consists primarily in the\ndevelopment of natural science, beginning in eighteenth-century Europe and\nNorth America, while Norton\u2019s subject is the colonization of the Americas.\n\nThe two books share a thesis: that human-animal relationships do not just\ndescribe or illuminate human self-understanding but in some sense contribute\nto the formation of human self-understanding. As Norton puts it, \u201cthe ways\nthat people relate to other animals...are generative of how people understand\nthemselves and others.\u201d\n\nRobles organizes Curious Species around four types of animals\u2014coral polyps,\nrattlesnakes, stingrays, and raccoons\u2014to examine how each has been \u201ca\nformidable and frequently opposing force to human will and history,\u201d both by\ndeclining to be assimilated into neat scientific categories and by disrupting\nhuman plans, as when the risk of rattlesnake attacks significantly delayed a\n1728 British surveying expedition of what is now Virginia and North Carolina.\n\n\u201cZoophytes,\u201d the archaic term for the family of ambiguous creatures, neither\nplant nor animal, that included corals, \u201cconfounded those who studied them in\nthe eighteenth century,\u201d Robles writes. \u201cLanguage broke down when trying to\ncapture them in words or images.\u201d For Buffon, corals were \u201cthe last of\nanimals, and the first of plants,\u201d while for a contemporary the British\nnaturalist Henry Baker, corals prompted an almost mystical encounter with\nineffable unknowability. As Baker wrote in 1743, \u201c\u2019Tis, methinks, a little\npresuming to restrain the Operations of Nature, or imagine that God has done\nnothing but according to certain Rules well known to us.\u201d The attempt \u201cto\ndiscover and describe the Machinery whereby, and the manner how these\nwonderful Effects are performed, which we neither have Senses to discern, nor\nAbilities to judge of,\u201d creates a situation, he further observed, in which\n\u201call is Darkness and Uncertainty, [and] we plunge into an unfathomable Abyss\nwithout either Star or Compass to direct our Course.\u201d\n\nThe question of coral\u2019s identity, then, is not just about coral. For Baker and\nother Enlightenment-era thinkers, coral raised more pressing questions about\nhumanity\u2019s capabilities. Here, as throughout Curious Species, Robles is adept\nat identifying and explicating moments in natural history when a creature\u2019s\nprofound otherness, from the perspective of human scientists, forced those\nscientists to wonder about themselves. A coral, for example, can \u201csplit\nasunder and become two fully functional animals.\u201d Since several prominent\nearly modern thinkers, such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, held that animals\nhad souls analogous to human souls, these facts of coral biology raised\ndiscomfiting theological questions. \u201cWas the soul indivisible?\u201d Robles asks.\n\u201cOr could two souls be made from one? And if the latter proved true, what did\nthat mean for identity, for individuals?\u201d\n\nRobles recounts the ways the naturalists of early modernity \u201cfeverishly\nquantified and described every facet of the animal specimens they collected.\nThis was especially true,\u201d she writes, \u201cwhen it came to matters reproductive.\nIn possession of a dead rattlesnake, they would count the number of joints in\nits rattle, measure the snake\u2019s length and girth, tally up its total number of\nscales, and, were it a gravid female, slice its abdomen to unearth and account\nfor the offspring inside.\u201d\n\nRobles notes how, in the name of research, natural scientists decimated the\nrattlesnake population in northeastern North America. \u201cAllow for a moment of\nalterity,\u201d she writes. \u201cWhat might these scenes of destruction have looked\nlike from a rattlesnake\u2019s perspective?\u201d What follows is a harrowing and\nfascinating passage, based on the science of snake perception, that offers one\npossible version of a snake\u2019s point of view when humans invade its\nhibernaculum.\n\nFor Marcy Norton, in The Tame and the Wild, this blending of human and animal\nconsciousness was an essential aspect of both European and American indigenous\nrelationships with animals in the early modern period. Describing aristocratic\nEuropean hunting practices, Norton writes, \u201cThe intensity of the collaboration\nbetween hunters and [animals] was such that their attunement could lead to a\ntemporary sense of porous boundaries and a merger of subjectivities similar to\nwhat humans might experience during collective rites, sexual intimacy, and\nmeditation.\u201d As John Astley, whose equestrian skill is memorialized in a\nportrait in the British Museum, wrote in a 1584 manual, \u201cin everie act that\nyou shall doo, [the horse] will accompanie you, and you shall accompanie him\nin time and measure, so as to the beholders it shall appear, that he and you\nbe one bodie, of one mind, and of one will.\u201d \u201cHunting,\u201d Norton writes,\n\u201crequired human participants to recognize canine, equine, and avian vassals\nand prey...as fellow subjects with desires, emotions, and even reason.\u201d\n\nEuropean practices of hunting, livestock husbandry, and warfare, Norton\nargues, were inseparable from the subjectivity of the animals these practices\nrelied on. Because these practices were also the central means of European\ncolonization of the Americas, that process of colonization was driven, in part\nand inextricably, by animals. But just as important for Norton as the role of\nanimals in European designs is the role of animals in indigenous influence on\nEurope. Through historical and anthropological scholarship, including close\nreadings of indigenous American art and writing, Norton demonstrates that\nindigenous modes of relating to animals, including taming wild creatures and\nthereby transforming them into kin, had profound ramifications for European\nculture. Among other things, these transformations made domesticated animals\ninto hunting partners and household pets, but they also created the\nfoundations for many of the practical and epistemological aspects of\nEnlightenment-era natural science that Robles discusses.\n\nIn some cases, these indigenous and European modes of interacting with animals\ncollided with each other and with the agency of the animals themselves. Norton\ndescribes the Castilian mastiff Becerrillo, a dog trained for war, who became\nknown for his exceptional ferocity and intelligence during the Spanish\ncampaigns to colonize Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. For instance, after the\nSpanish subdued an anticolonial uprising, a Spanish military captain gave an\nelderly female captive a letter to deliver to Ponce de Le\u00f3n, and then\u2014after\nfooling the woman into thinking she would be liberated for her\nservice\u2014commanded Becerrillo to maul her to death.\n\nNorton quotes the writer and conquistador Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo\u2019s\ndescription of what happened next: \u201cWhen the woman saw [Becerrillo] going\naggressively for her, she sat on the ground and in her language started to\nspeak and said to him, \u2018Dog, Sir Dog, I am going to bring this letter to the\nLord governor\u2019 and she showed him the letter...and said to him, \u2018Do not do me\nany harm, Sir Dog.\u2019 And indeed the dog stopped as if he had heard her\nspeaking, and arrived very tamely to her.\u201d Surprised and inspired by \u201cthe\nclemency\u201d Becerrillo showed this woman, the captain had the dog confined and\nordered the woman set free. As Norton comments, \u201cAlthough this episode may\nhave been unusual...the mode of interaction that underlay it was not.\u201d\n\nFor Norton and Robles, such a mode of interaction is relevant not only to the\npast but to the present and future. In Norton\u2019s words, a history that sees\nanimals as central, rather than marginal, players in human processes can show\nus that \u201cour current ideas and practices around objectifying nonhuman beings\nare a historical and, therefore, contingent development; we can see that it is\nour choice to end that practice.\u201d Both writers speculate on the kinds of\nethical responses and ecological mindsets the idea of animal agency might\nenable or demand. Consequently, despite the often brutal histories of\necological destruction and colonial violence Norton and Robles explore, they\nare ultimately hopeful, and encourage us to consider how relationships of\ncooperation and perhaps even solidarity might be forged between human beings\nand animals.\n\nBoth Norton and Robles, then, offer a historical grounding for a theoretical\nframework that science and technology studies scholar Donna Haraway advanced\nin her 2003 book, The Companion Species Manifesto, according to which \u201can\nethics and politics committed to the flourishing of significant otherness\u201d can\nemerge from \u201ca story of co-habitation, co-evolution, and embodied cross-\nspecies sociality\u201d between humans and animals. Unlike many posthumanist\nthinkers, Haraway, Norton, and Robles reject facile technological teleologies\n(found in, for example, the transhumanism of futurist Ray Kurzweil), but they\nnevertheless insist that there are ethical resources to be gained in\novercoming narrow ideas of human agency. The research of Norton and Robles\ndemonstrates that such an approach to posthumanism has a rich prehistory and\nthat, even in the midst of Enlightenment-era humanism, the boundaries of the\nhuman were never understood to be as stable as many posthumanist thinkers\noften assume.\n\nReprinted from The Hedgehog Review 26.1 (Spring 2024).
