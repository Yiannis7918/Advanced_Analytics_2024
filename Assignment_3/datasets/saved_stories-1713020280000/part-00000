The\nflight was operated by Germanwings, a low-cost carrier owned by the German\nairline Lufthansa. On 24 March 2015, the aircraft, an Airbus A320-211, crashed\n100 km (62 mi; 54 nmi) north-west of Nice in the French Alps. All 144\npassengers and six crew members were killed.^[2]^[3]\n\nThe crash was deliberately caused by the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, who had\npreviously been treated for suicidal tendencies and declared unfit to work by\nhis doctor. Lubitz kept this information from his employer and instead\nreported for duty. Shortly after reaching cruise altitude and while the\ncaptain was out of the cockpit, Lubitz locked the cockpit door and initiated a\ncontrolled descent that continued until the aircraft hit a\nmountainside.^[4]^[5]\n\nAviation authorities swiftly implemented new recommendations from the European\nUnion Aviation Safety Agency that required two authorised personnel in the\ncockpit at all times but, by 2017, Germanwings and other German airlines had\ndropped the rule.\n\nThe Lubitz family held a press conference in March 2017 during which Lubitz's\nfather said that they did not accept the official investigative findings that\nhis son deliberately caused the crash. By 2017, Lufthansa had paid \u20ac75,000 to\nthe family of every victim, as well as \u20ac10,000 in pain and suffering\ncompensation to every close relative of a victim.\n\n## Flight[edit]\n\nFlight pathAltitude chart (metres)^[6]^[7]\n\nGermanwings Flight 9525 took off from Runway 06R at Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport\non 24 March 2015 at 10:01 am CET (09:01 UTC), 26 minutes behind schedule.^[8]\nIt was due to arrive at D\u00fcsseldorf Airport by 11:39 CET.^[2]^[9] According to\nthe French national civil aviation inquiries bureau, the Bureau of Enquiry and\nAnalysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA),^[10] the pilots confirmed\ninstructions from French air traffic control at 10:30 CET.\n\nAt 10:31 CET, after crossing the French coast near Toulon, the aircraft left\nits assigned cruising altitude of 38,000 ft (11,600 m) and without approval\nbegan to descend rapidly. The air traffic controller declared the aircraft in\ndistress after its descent and loss of radio contact.^[11]^[12]^[13]\n\nThe descent time from 38,000 ft was about 10 minutes; radar observed an\naverage descent rate around 3,400 ft/min (58 ft/s (18 m/s)).^[14] Attempts by\nFrench air traffic control to contact the flight on the assigned radio\nfrequency were not answered. A French military Mirage jet was scrambled from\nthe Orange-Caritat Air Base to intercept the aircraft.^[15]^[16] Radar contact\nwas lost at 10:40 CET; at the time, the aircraft had descended to 6,175 feet\n(1,880 m),^[17] and crashed in the remote commune of Prads-Haute-Bl\u00e9one, 100\nkm (62 mi; 54 nmi) north-west of Nice.^[18]^[19]^[20]^[21] A seismological\nstation of the Sismalp network, the Grenoble Observatory, 12 km (7.5 mi; 6.5\nnmi) from the crash site, recorded the associated seismic event, determining\nthe impact time as 10:41:05 CET.^[22]\n\n### Crash site[edit]\n\nThe Massif des Trois-\u00c9v\u00each\u00e9s, where the crash site lies\n\nThe crash site is within the Massif des Trois-\u00c9v\u00each\u00e9s, 3 km (1.9 mi; 1.6 nmi)\neast of the settlement Le Vernet and beyond the road to the Col de Mariaud, in\nan area known as the Ravin du Ros\u00e9.^[23] The aircraft crashed on the southern\nside of the T\u00eate du Travers,^[24] a minor peak in the lower western slopes of\nthe T\u00eate de l'Estrop, at an elevation of 1,550 m (5,085.3 ft).^[1]^: 28 The\naircraft was travelling at 700 km/h (380 kn; 435 mph) when it struck the\nmountain.^[25] The site is about 10 km (6 mi; 5 nmi) west of Mount Cimet,\nwhere Air France Flight 178 crashed in 1953.^[26]^[27]\n\nGendarmerie nationale and S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Civile sent helicopters to locate the\nwreckage.^[28] The aircraft had disintegrated; the largest piece of wreckage\nwas the size of a car.^[7] A helicopter landed near the crash site; its\npersonnel confirmed no survivors.^[29] The search and rescue team reported the\ndebris field covered 2 km^2 (500 acres).^[20]\n\n## Aircraft[edit]\n\nThe aircraft involved was a 24-year-old Airbus A320-211,^[b] serial number\n147, registered as D-AIPX. It made its first flight on 29 November 1990^[30]\nand was delivered to Lufthansa on 5 February 1991.^[31]^[32] The aircraft was\nleased to Germanwings from 1 June 2003 until mid-2004,^[33] then returned to\nLufthansa on 22 July 2004 and remained with the airline until it was\ntransferred to Germanwings again on 31 January 2014.^[32]^[33] The aircraft\nhad accumulated about 58,300 flight hours on 46,700 flights.^[34]\n\nPeople on board by citizenship^[12]Citizenship| No.| Ref.  \n---|---|---  \nGermany^[c]| 72| ^[36]  \nSpain| 51| ^[37]  \nArgentina| 3| ^[38]  \nKazakhstan| 3| ^[39]  \nUnited Kingdom^[d]| 3| ^[42]  \nUnited States| 3| ^[43]  \nAustralia| 2| ^[44]  \nColombia| 2| ^[45]  \nIran| 2| ^[46]  \nJapan| 2| ^[47]  \nMexico^[e]| 2| ^[49]  \nMorocco| 2| ^[50]  \nVenezuela| 2| ^[51]  \nBelgium| 1| ^[52]  \nChile| 1| ^[53]  \nDenmark| 1| ^[54]  \nIsrael| 1| ^[55]  \nNetherlands| 1| ^[56]  \nSome passengers had multiple citizenship. Counts are based on preliminary data\nand do not total 150.  \n  \nDuring its final flight, the aircraft was carrying 144 passengers and six crew\n(two pilots and four cabin crew members)^[2]^[57] from at least 18\ncountries\u2014mostly Germany and Spain.^[12] The count was confused by the\nmultiple citizenship status of some people on board.^[58]\n\n### Crew and passengers[edit]\n\nAmong the passengers were 16 students and 2 teachers from the Joseph-K\u00f6nig-\nGymnasium of Haltern am See, North Rhine-Westphalia. They were returning home\nfrom a student exchange with the Giola Institute in Llinars del Vall\u00e8s,\nBarcelona.^[59] Haltern's mayor, Bodo Klimpel, described the crash as \"the\ndarkest day in the history of [the] town\".^[60] Bass-baritone Oleg Bryjak and\ncontralto Maria Radner, singers with Deutsche Oper am Rhein, were also on the\nflight.^[61]^[62]\n\nThe flight's pilot in command was 34-year-old Captain Patrick\nSondenheimer,^[63] who had 10 years' experience (6,000 flight hours, including\n3,812 hours on the Airbus A320)^[18] flying A320s for Germanwings, Lufthansa,\nand Condor.^[64]^[13] The co-pilot was 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz,^[65] who\njoined Germanwings in September 2013 and had 630 flying hours, 540 of them on\nthe Airbus A320.^[66]^[67]\n\n#### Andreas Lubitz[edit]\n\nCo-pilot Andreas G\u00fcnter Lubitz,^[68] born on 18 December 1987, was raised in\nNeuburg an der Donau, Bavaria,^[69] and Montabaur in the German state of\nRhineland-Palatinate.^[64] He took flying lessons at Luftsportclub Westerwald,\nan aviation sports club in Montabaur.^[64]^[70]\n\nLubitz was accepted into a Lufthansa trainee programme after finishing high\nschool. In September 2008, he began training at the Lufthansa Flight Training\nschool in Bremen, Germany.^[1]^[64] He suspended his pilot training in\nNovember 2008 after being hospitalised for a severe episode of depression.\nAfter his psychiatrist determined that the depressive episode was fully\nresolved, Lubitz returned to the Lufthansa school in August\n2009.^[1]^[71]^[72]^[73]^[74] Lubitz moved to the United States in November\n2010 to continue training at the Lufthansa Airline Training Center in\nGoodyear, Arizona.^[75]^[76] From June 2011 to December 2013, he worked as a\nflight attendant for Lufthansa while training to obtain his commercial pilot's\nlicence,^[64]^[70] and joined Germanwings as a first officer in June 2014.^[1]\n\n## Investigation[edit]\n\nThe French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA)\nopened an investigation into the crash; it was joined by its German\ncounterpart, the Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation (BFU). The\nBEA investigation was led by Arnaud Desjardin and was assisted by the United\nStates Federal Bureau of Investigation.^[77]^[78]^[79] Hours after the crash,\nthe BEA sent seven investigators to the site; these were accompanied by\nrepresentatives from Airbus and CFM International. The cockpit voice recorder,\nwhich was damaged but still functional, was recovered by rescue workers and\nexamined by the investigation team.^[80]^[81]^[82]^[83] The following week,\nBrice Robin, the government prosecutor based in Marseille, announced that the\nflight data recorder, blackened by fire but still usable, had also been\nfound.^[84]^[85] Investigators isolated 150 sets of DNA, which were compared\nwith the DNA of the victims' families.^[86]^[87]\n\n### Cause of crash[edit]\n\nAccording to French and German prosecutors, the crash was deliberately caused\nby the co-pilot, Lubitz.^[88]^[89]^[90] Robin said Lubitz was courteous to\nCaptain Sondenheimer during the first part of the flight, then became \"curt\"\nwhen the captain began the midflight briefing on the planned landing.^[25]\nRobin said that when the captain left the cockpit, possibly to use the toilet,\nLubitz locked the door, preventing anyone from entering.^[88]^[89]^[91] The\ncaptain had a code to unlock the door, but the lock's code panel could be\ndisabled from the cockpit controls.^[92]^[93]^[91] The captain requested re-\nentry using the intercom; he knocked and then banged on the door, but received\nno response.^[94] The captain then tried to break down the door, but like most\ncockpit doors made after the September 11 attacks, it had been reinforced to\nprevent intrusion.^[10]^[72]^[95]^[96] During the descent, the co-pilot did\nnot respond to questions from Marseille air traffic control, nor did he\ntransmit a distress call.^[97] Robin said contact from the air traffic control\ntower, the captain's attempts to break in, and Lubitz's steady breathing were\naudible on the cockpit voice recording.^[89]^[98] The screams of passengers in\nthe last moments before impact were also heard on the recording.^[25]^[99]\n\nAfter their initial analysis of the aircraft's flight data recorder, the BEA\nconcluded that Lubitz had made flight control inputs that led to the crash. He\nhad set the autopilot to descend to 100 ft (30 m) and accelerated the speed of\nthe descending aircraft several times thereafter.^[100]^[101] The BEA\npreliminary report into the crash was published six weeks later, on 6 May\n2015. It confirmed the initial analysis of the aircraft's flight data recorder\nand revealed that during the earlier outbound Flight 9524 from D\u00fcsseldorf to\nBarcelona, Lubitz had practised setting the autopilot altitude dial to 100 ft\nseveral times while the captain was out of the cockpit.^[102]^[103]\n\nThe BEA final report into the crash was published on 13 March 2016. The report\nconfirmed the findings made in the preliminary report and concluded that\nLubitz had deliberately crashed the aircraft as a suicidal murder. The report\nstated:^[1]\n\n> The collision with the ground was due to the deliberate and planned action\n> of the co-pilot, who decided to commit suicide while alone in the cockpit.\n> The process for medical certification of pilots, in particular self-\n> reporting in case of a decrease in medical fitness between two periodic\n> medical evaluations, did not succeed in preventing the co-pilot, who was\n> experiencing mental disorder with psychotic symptoms, from exercising the\n> privilege of his license.\n>\n> \u2014 Causes, BEA Final Report\n\n### Investigation of Lubitz[edit]\n\nThree days after the crash, German detectives searched Lubitz's Montabaur\nproperties and removed a computer and other items for testing. They did not\nfind a suicide note nor any evidence that his actions had been motivated by \"a\npolitical or religious background\".^[104]^[105]^[106] During their search of\nLubitz's apartment, detectives found a letter written by a doctor indicating\nLubitz had been declared unfit to work. Germanwings stated it had not received\na sick note from Lubitz for the day of the flight. News accounts said Lubitz\nwas \"hiding an illness from his employers\".^[107]^[108]^[109]^[110]^[111]\nUnder German law, employers do not have access to employees' medical records,\nand sick notes excusing people from work do not give information about medical\nconditions,^[112] so employers must rely on employees to declare their lack of\nwork fitness.^[77]^[113]^[114]\n\nThe following day, authorities again searched Lubitz's home where they found\nevidence he suffered from a psychosomatic illness and was taking prescription\ndrugs.^[115]^[116] Criminal investigators said Lubitz's web searches on his\ntablet computer in the days leading up to the crash included \"ways to commit\nsuicide\" and \"cockpit doors and their security provisions\".^[84]^[85]^[86]\nRobin said doctors had told him Lubitz should not have been flying, but\nmedical secrecy requirements prevented his physician from making this\ninformation available to Germanwings.^[117]^[118] Such secrecy should consider\npublic safety, said BEA investigator Arnaud Desjardin.^[77]^[113]^[114]\n\nThe investigation into Lubitz revealed his treatment for suicidal tendencies\nprior to his training as a commercial pilot, when he had been temporarily\ndenied a US pilot's licence because of treatments for psychotic\ndepression.^[119]^[120]^[121]^[1] For years, Lubitz had frequently been unable\nto sleep because of what he believed were vision problems; he consulted over\n40 doctors, fearing he was going blind.^[117]^[118]^[122] Motivated by the\nfear that blindness would cause him to lose his pilot's licence, he began\nconducting online research about methods of committing suicide before deciding\nto crash Flight 9525.^[1]^[64]^[118]^[122]^[123]\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\nMemorial at D\u00fcsseldorf Airport\n\nFrench Minister of the Interior Bernard Cazeneuve announced that due to the\n\"violence of the impact\", \"little hope\" existed that any survivors would be\nfound.^[124] Then-Prime Minister Manuel Valls dispatched Cazeneuve to the\nscene and set up a ministerial task force to coordinate the response to the\nincident.^[125] German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier flew over the\ncrash site, describing it as \"a picture of horror\".^[125] German Chancellor\nAngela Merkel and the minister-president of North Rhine-Westphalia Hannelore\nKraft travelled to the crash site the following day.^[126]^[127] Merkel,\nValls, and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy visited the recovery\noperations base at Seyne-les-Alpes.^[128] Bodo Klimpel, mayor of Haltern am\nSee, reacting to the deaths of 16 students and 2 teachers from the town, said\nthat people were shocked by the crash.^[129]\n\nGermanwings headquarters in Cologne: flags at half-mast following loss of\nFlight 9525\n\nLufthansa chief executive officer Carsten Spohr visited the crash location the\nday following the crash; he said it was \"the darkest day for Lufthansa in its\n60-year history\".^[130] Several Germanwings flights were cancelled on 24 and\n25 March due to the pilots' grief at the murders and at the loss of their\ncolleagues.^[131] Germanwings retired the flight number 4U9525, changing it to\n4U9441; the outbound flight number was changed from 4U9524 to 4U9440.^[132] In\nthe days following the crash, Lufthansa at first said it saw no reason to\nchange its procedures, then reversed its earlier statement by introducing a\nnew policy across its airlines requiring the presence of two crew members in\nthe cockpit at all times.^[133]^[134]^[135]\n\n### Regulatory[edit]\n\nIn response to the incident and the circumstances of the co-pilot's\ninvolvement, aviation authorities in some countries implemented new\nregulations that require the presence of two authorised personnel in the\ncockpit at all times.^[136]^[92]^[137]^[138] Three days after the incident,\nthe European Aviation Safety Agency issued a temporary recommendation for\nairlines to ensure that at least two crew members\u2014including at least one\npilot\u2014were in the cockpit for the entire duration of the flight.^[139] Several\nairlines announced that they had already adopted similar policies\nvoluntarily.^[140]^[141]^[142] But by 2016, the EASA stopped recommending the\ntwo-person rule, instead advising airlines to perform a risk assessment and\ndecide for themselves whether to implement it.^[143] Germanwings and other\nGerman airlines dropped the procedure in 2017.^[144]\n\nThe British Psychological Society issued a statement offering expert support\nin psychological testing and monitoring of pilots.^[145] The European\nFederation of Psychologists' Associations issued a statement supporting\npsychological testing in the selection of pilots, but also stated it could not\nforecast the life events and mental health problems of individual pilots, nor\ncould it predict the unique ways pilots would cope with these. It said\npriority should be given to psychological help for relatives and friends of\nvictims in the aftermath of a disaster.^[146] CEO Spohr proposed random checks\nof pilots' psychological fitness and a loosening of the extant\nphysician\u2013patient confidentiality laws. Politicians began echoing the call to\nloosen the laws in exceptional cases.^[147]^[148]\n\nThe national police force in France, the National Gendarmerie, introduced a\nnew set of support mechanisms to minimise the psychosocial risks to relief\nworkers who deal with events such as Flight 9525 in their daily jobs.^[149]\n\n### Compensation and litigation[edit]\n\nGermanwings' parent company Lufthansa offered victims' families an initial aid\npayment up to \u20ac50,000, separate from any legally required compensation for the\ndisaster. Elmar Giemulla, a professor of aviation law at the Technical\nUniversity of Berlin quoted by the Rheinische Post, said he expected the\nairline would pay a total of \u20ac10\u201330 million in compensation. The Montreal\nConvention sets a per-victim cap of \u20ac143,000 in the event an airline is held\nliable, unless negligence can be proven.^[150]^[151] Insurance specialists\nsaid although co-pilot Andreas Lubitz hid a serious illness from his employer\nand deliberately crashed the passenger aircraft, these facts would not affect\nthe issue of compensation nor be applicable to the exclusion clause in\nLufthansa's insurance policy.^[150] Lufthansa's insurance company set aside\nUS$300 million (\u20ac280 million) for financial compensation to victims' families\nand for the cost of the aircraft.^[152]^[153] By 2017, Lufthansa had paid\n\u20ac75,000 to the family of every victim, as well as \u20ac10,000 in pain and\nsuffering compensation to every close relative of a victim.^[154]\n\nVictim families sued the Lufthansa Airline Training Center in Arizona to\nobtain higher compensation, but the case was reverted to German courts in\nMarch 2017.^[155] In July 2020, a court in Essen ruled against several victim\nfamilies, holding that neither Lufthansa nor the training centre in Arizona\ncould be held liable. Flight doctors who may have negligently authorised\nLubitz to fly were working on behalf of the German government's flight\nauthority, the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt.^[156] The ruling was upheld on appeal in\nSeptember 2021.^[157] In November 2021, a coroner's inquest into the deaths of\ntwo British victims concluded with a verdict of unlawful killing.^[158]\n\n### Commemorative[edit]\n\nMass grave in Le Vernet cemetery for the unidentifiable remains of the\nvictims. The names of all 149 victims are engraved on the cemetery wall.\n\nShortly after the crash, a memorial stone in memory of the victims was erected\nnear the crash site in Le Vernet.^[159] The following month, about 1,400\nrelatives of victims, senior politicians, rescue workers, and airline\nemployees attended a memorial service at Cologne Cathedral.^[160] The parents\nof Andreas Lubitz were invited to the service but did not attend.^[161]\n\nThe remains of 15 of the 16 school children and their two teachers arrived in\ntheir home town of Haltern for burial two months after the crash. Residents\nheld white roses as the hearses passed the children's school, where 18\ntrees\u2014one for each victim\u2014had been planted as a memorial.^[162] In D\u00fcsseldorf\non the same day, the remains of 44 of the 72 German victims arrived for\nburial. Errors on the victims' death certificates had caused a delay.^[163]\n\nIn September 2017, a sculpture called Sonnenkugel (\"Sunsphere\") was installed\nat the site of the crash.

The\ncolumn holds 149 wooden spheres, which in turn hold personal mementos provided\nby the victims' family members.^[164]^[165]^[166]\n\n### Second anniversary[edit]\n\nThe Lubitz family held a press conference on 24 March 2017, two years after\nthe crash. Lubitz's father said the family did not accept the official\ninvestigative findings that Andreas Lubitz deliberately caused the crash or\nthat he had been depressed at the time. Aviation journalist Tim van Beveren\npublished a report which asserted that Lubitz could have fallen unconscious,\nthat the cockpit door lock had malfunctioned on previous flights, and that\npotentially dangerous turbulence had been reported in the area on the day of\nthe crash. Van Beveren had been commissioned by the family and was present at\nthe press conference. The timing of the press conference by Lubitz's father,\non the anniversary of the crash, was criticised by families of the victims,\nwho were holding their own remembrances on that day.^[167]^[168]^[169]^[170]\n\n## Dramatisation[edit]\n\nThe crash was dramatised in season 16 of the Canadian TV series Mayday in an\nepisode entitled \"Murder in the Skies\".^[171] The episode aired on 24 January\n2017.^[172]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * List of declared or suspected pilot suicides\n  * List of accidents and incidents involving the Airbus A320 family\n  * List of aircraft accidents and incidents resulting in at least 50 fatalities\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Abbreviated forms of the flight name combine the airline's IATA airline code (4U) or ICAO airline code (GWI) with the flight number.\n  2. ^ The aircraft was an Airbus A320-200 model; the suffix '11' signifies it was fitted with CFM International CFM56-5A1 engines.\n  3. ^ Includes two passengers with dual Bosnian\u2013German citizenship.^[35]\n  4. ^ Includes one passenger with Spanish\u2013Polish\u2013British citizenship.^[40]^[41]\n  5. ^ Includes one passenger with dual Mexican\u2013Spanish citizenship.^[48]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g ^h ^i \"Final Investigation Report: Accident to the Airbus A320-211, registered D-AIPX and operated by Germanwings, flight GWI18G, on 03/24/15 at Prads-Haute-Bl\u00e9one\".
