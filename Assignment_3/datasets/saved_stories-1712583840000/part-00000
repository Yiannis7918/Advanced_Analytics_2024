The new investigation\nwill look into whether Musk engaged in obstruction, criminal organization and\nincitement.\n\nMORE ON MUSK\n\nMusk abruptly cancels \u2018The Don Lemon Show\u2019 on X after he sits for the\nprogram\u2019s first interview\n\n4 things to know from Elon Musk\u2019s interview with Don Lemon\n\nLawyers who successfully argued Musk pay package was illegal seek $5.6 billion\nin Tesla stock\n\nMusk has not commented on X about the latest development as of late Sunday.\n\nBrazil\u2019s political right has long characterized de Moraes as overstepping his\nbounds to clamp down on free speech and engage in political persecution. In\nthe digital militias investigation, lawmakers from former President Jair\nBolsonaro\u2019s circle have been imprisoned and his supporters\u2019 homes raided.\nBolsonaro himself became a target of the investigation in 2021.\n\nDe Moraes\u2019 defenders have said his decisions, although extraordinary, are\nlegally sound and necessary to purge social media of fake news as well as\nextinguish threats to Brazilian democracy \u2014 notoriously underscored by the\nJan. 8, 2023, uprising in Brazil\u2019s capital that resembled the Jan. 6, 2021\ninsurrection in the U.S. Capitol.\n\nPresident of the Superior Electoral Court, Judge Alexandre de Moraes, speaks\nduring the inauguration of the Center for Combating Disinformation and Defense\nof Democracy in Brasilia, Brazil, March 12, 2024. (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres,\nFile)\n\nOn Saturday, Musk \u2014 a self-declared free speech absolutist \u2014 wrote on X that\nthe platform would lift all restrictions on blocked accounts and predicted\nthat the move was likely to dry up revenue in Brazil and force the company to\nshutter its local office.\n\n\u201cBut principles matter more than profit,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe later instructed users in Brazil to download a VPN to retain access if X\nwas shut down and wrote that X would publish all of de Moraes\u2019 demands,\nclaiming they violate Brazilian law.\n\n\u201cThese are the most draconian demands of any country on Earth!\u201d he later\nwrote.\n\nEARLIER COVERAGE\n\nSeveral probes target Brazil\u2019s Bolsonaro, but his COVID decisions are catching\nup to him first\n\nBrazilian police launch investigation into Bolsonaro\u2019s 2-night sleepover at\nHungarian embassy\n\nEXPLAINER: Roots of the Brazilian capital\u2019s chaotic uprising\n\nMusk had not published de Moraes\u2019 demands as of late Sunday and prominent\nblocked accounts remained so, indicating X had yet to act based on Musk\u2019s\nprevious pledges.\n\nMoraes\u2019 decision warned against doing so, saying each blocked account that X\neventually reactivates will entail a fine of 100,000 reais ($20,000) per day,\nand that those responsible will be held legally to account for disobeying a\ncourt order.\n\nBrazil\u2019s attorney general wrote Saturday night that it was urgent for Brazil\nto regulate social media platforms. \u201cWe cannot live in a society in which\nbillionaires domiciled abroad have control of social networks and put\nthemselves in a position to violate the rule of law, failing to comply with\ncourt orders and threatening our authorities. Social peace is non-negotiable,\u201d\nJorge Messias wrote on X.\n\nBrazil\u2019s constitution was drafted after the 1964-1985 military dictatorship\nand contains a long list of aspirational goals and prohibitions against\nspecific crimes such as racism and, more recently, homophobia.
