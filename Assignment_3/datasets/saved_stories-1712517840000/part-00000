It made my software development\nwork faster and more enjoyable, so I\u2019ve gotten more into the home server\nscene. I built a custom storage server, another development server, and a\ndedicated firewall.\n\nAt some point, my wife gently observed that my office was filling with\nunsightly wires. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u201cThis is a normal amount of wires.\u201d But then\nI looked around and realized it was kind of a lot of wires...\n\nMy office, upon closer inspection, kind of had a lot of wires\n\nA lot of home server enthusiasts buy server racks, but I never thought of\nmyself as a rack guy. I wasn\u2019t so into servers that I needed a whole rack; I\njust had a VM server here, a data server there. Maybe a few switches scattered\naround. Buying a rack meant admitting that I wasn\u2019t just a casual home server\nguy but an intense homelab weirdo.\n\nOne day, I gave in and bought a rack, and I\u2019m better for it. It makes my\nservers more pleasant to work with and eliminates my sprawling mess of wires.\n\n## I don\u2019t want your life story \u2014 just show me the rack \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nIf you want to skip the explanations and jump to my rack, see my final setup\nbelow.\n\n## Table of contents \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n  * What\u2019s a homelab?\n  * Why build a server rack at home?\n  * Why this guide?\n  * Choosing a rack\n  * Choosing a network switch\n  * Choosing 10G NICs\n  * Choosing a UPS (battery backup)\n  * Choosing a power strip\n  * Choosing rack shelves\n  * Choosing a patch panel\n  * Choosing a Raspberry Pi rack mount\n  * Choosing Ethernet cables\n  * Choosing fiber cables\n  * What I already had\n  * How do I arrange components in a rack?\n  * My final rack setup\n  * Next steps in my rack\n  * Avoiding mistakes I made\n  * My life with a rack\n\n## What\u2019s a homelab? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n\u201cHomelab\u201d is a colloquial term that\u2019s grown in popularity over the last\ndecade.\n\nA homelab is a place in your home where you can experiment with IT hardware\nand software that you\u2019d typically find in an office or a data center. You can\nuse it as a practice environment for new professional skills or as a place to\nplay with cool technology.\n\n## Why build a server rack at home? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nIf you\u2019ve never worked with servers, you might wonder why anyone would keep a\nbunch of them in their house, much less build a little shrine for them.\n\nEveryone has their own reasons for getting into homelab, but here are mine:\n\n  * Software development: I use a dedicated server for virtual machines, so rebooting or upgrading my main workstation doesn\u2019t affect what\u2019s running on my server. It\u2019s easy for me to spin up new experimental VMs that don\u2019t affect my other projects.\n  * Storage: It\u2019s more convenient to have a huge amount of storage that all of my devices share rather than buying large hard drives for each device and scattering my data everywhere. The storage server uses ZFS, which reduces the risk of data loss, even when a hard drive dies.\n  * Networking: Building my own router with open-source software gives me more control over my network and saves me from the buggy software that lives on most consumer-grade routers.\n\n## Why this guide? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n### By a beginner for beginners \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nEven though I\u2019ve been experimenting with homelab for the past few years, this\nwas my first time building a server rack, so this is a beginner-level guide.\n\nEvery other article I\u2019ve read about server racks reads like someone explaining\ntheir 20th rack. They don\u2019t explain how they chose components or why they\nrejected alternatives. They\u2019ve been doing it for so long that their decisions\nare unconscious.\n\nBecause this is my first time building a server rack, I\u2019m free from the curse\nof knowledge. I\u2019m walking you through how I approached this process for the\nfirst time.\n\n### No conflict of interest \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nI\u2019m not getting paid by anyone or receiving free products to write this post.\nI have no advertisers to satisfy or partnerships to maintain.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth about most homelab blogs is that they\u2019re funded by\naffiliate links. This means the author receives a commission when their\nreaders purchase products through links in the article.\n\nAuthors can still provide valuable information while using affiliate links,\nand some of the best homelab bloggers fund their work that way. Nevertheless,\naffiliate links create a conflict of interest between the author and their\nreaders. If merchants pay the author a percentage commission to link to their\nproducts, it incentivizes the author to recommend expensive products and\nsubpar merchants.\n\nI\u2019m not claiming to be pure of heart or denouncing anyone who writes for\nmoney, but my incentives are more aligned with my readers\u2019. I write my blog\nout of vanity \u2014 I like when people tell me that they find my posts interesting\nor useful. Writing out my thought process also helps me improve my approach\nand elicits useful feedback from readers.\n\nMy rack does contain a TinyPilot, a hardware device that I created, but it\ndoesn\u2019t affect my other choices. I\u2019ll disclose my relationship with TinyPilot\nwhenever I mention it.\n\n## Choosing a rack \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nIf you\u2019re building a server rack, it seems like the first thing you\u2019d choose\nis the rack itself. It\u2019s not that simple.\n\nSelecting your rack is an iterative process. You can\u2019t decide what type of\nrack to buy until you know what components your rack will hold. But knowing\nwhat type of racks are available also informs what components to buy.\n\nHere\u2019s the process I followed to pick a server rack:\n\n  1. Browse racks casually to get a high-level view of pricing, features, and size options.\n  2. Make a rough list of components I want for my rack.\n  3. Calculate how much rack height and depth I\u2019ll need for those components.\n  4. Narrow the list of racks that meet my needs.\n  5. Repeat steps 2-4 until I\u2019ve made a final decision.\n\n### How many rack units? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nRacks have capacity measured in rack units (RUs). 1 rack unit is 1.75\". You\ntypically see racks sized as a number followed by a U, so an 8U rack would\nhave eight RUs or 8 x 1.75\" = 14\" of height for components.\n\nServer racks are sized in rack units where each rack unit is 1.75\".\n\nIf a component is designed to mount in a rack, its height will be some\nmultiple of a rack unit. Most network switches are 1U, battery backups are\nusually 2U, and servers are typically 2U.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to buy too short a rack and run out of room for your\ncomponents, but you also don\u2019t want an enormous rack that occupies more\nvertical space than you\u2019d ever use.\n\nAs you pick components, add up how many rack units they\u2019ll need. Leave some\nextra buffer based on how much you want to expand your rack in the next few\nyears.\n\n### How deep does it need to be? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nServer racks vary in depth. Most server racks are designed for enterprise-\ngrade servers, which are up to 50\" long.\n\nAt work, my office has an HP ProLiant DL380 G7 server, and it\u2019s a huge hassle.\nIt\u2019s 29\" long and weighs 50 lbs. It was a pain to mount and will be a pain\nwhen I sell it.\n\nI have a relatively small home office, and I didn\u2019t want the rack server to\ndominate the space. For my home rack, I decided to limit myself to components\nthat are shallow enough to only need front mounts.\n\nI looked for racks that were at least 19\" in depth. That gave me enough depth\nto mount rack shelves and front-mounted server chassis without taking up a lot\nof extra space.\n\n### Does it need four posts or two? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nRacks come in two different styles: two-post or four-post. On four-post racks,\nyou can mount components to both the front and the back.\n\nIf you plan to buy long, heavy servers, you definitely need to secure them\nfrom both ends. If you want to minimize space, a two-post rack might be\nsufficient.\n\nI only wanted front-mounting components, so I could have gotten away with two\nposts, but four posts felt a bit sturdier, so I figured why not.\n\n### Does it need wheels? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nSome server racks have wheels that move the entire structure around. Wheels\nwere a critical feature for me, as I wanted to clean behind the rack easily.\n\n### Candidates \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nStarTech is a popular brand for server racks. They have a good reputation and\na decent website, so I chose between different StarTech racks.\n\nBrand| Model| Min Depth| Posts| Wheels| Height| Price  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nStarTech| 4POSTRACK18U| 22\"| 4| Yes| 18U| $316  \nStarTech| 4POSTRACK15U| 22\"| 4| Yes| 15U| $301  \nStarTech| 2POSTRACK16| 12\"| 2| No| 16U| $165  \n  \n15U seemed like it would be enough, but the cost of 18U was so close that I\nfigured I might as well get the extra 3U of space.\n\n### Review: StarTech 4POSTRACK18U 18U rack \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n  * Grade: A\n\nThis rack is working out well. It feels sturdy, and the wheels make it easy to\nmove around.\n\nAssembly was straightforward. From start to finish, it took me about two and a\nhalf hours. One minor complaint is that none of the parts are labeled, but I\ncould match them to the instructions based on shape.\n\nThe rack is depth-adjustable, and I chose the shallowest depth: 22\". The rack\ndoes have a design flaw in that the shortest depth makes some screw holes\ninaccessible. I worked around this by expanding the depth, screwing in the\nspots that are unreachable at shallow depth, then adjusting the depth back\ndown.\n\n## Choosing a network switch \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nThe networking switch ended up being the hardest decision of my whole rack.\n\nNetwork switches get expensive fast, so I didn\u2019t want to spend $300 on\nsomething only to have to supplement it with another component or replace it\nlater on.\n\n### What speed do you need? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nUnless you\u2019re buying something very exotic, the speeds available for a rack-\nmounted switch are:\n\n  * 1 Gbps\n  * 2.5 Gbps\n  * 10 Gbps\n\nI\u2019ve had 1 Gbps Ethernet speed in my house for the past 10+ years, and that\u2019s\nbeen fine. I do most of my work online, so the bottleneck was almost always my\nISP rather than my home network.\n\nLately, I\u2019ve been finding that the bottleneck on my home storage server is my\n1 Gbps switch, so I\u2019ve been interested in a network upgrade.\n\nGiven that I\u2019ve been satisfied with 1 Gbps, I thought 10 Gbps would be an\nunnecessarily large jump. But the more I read about 2.5 Gbps hardware, the\nmore complaints I saw that it\u2019s flaky and unreliable. The consensus seems to\nbe that it\u2019s just as hard to level up to 10 Gbps as 2.5 Gbps, so you might as\nwell go for 10 Gbps.\n\nI did run into headaches, but I\u2019ll cover that more below.\n\nGotcha: If you see a 10 Gbps switch, check how many ports support 10 Gbps.\nOften, a 10 Gbps switch will only offer 10 Gbps speeds on a subset of ports,\nand the rest will be 1 Gbps.\n\n### Managed or unmanaged network switch? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nThere are two kinds of network switches: managed and unmanaged.\n\n  * Managed switches allow you to configure rules and settings for your switch. The most common reason you\u2019d want a managed switch is to create virtual networks (VLANs) to increase security on your network.\n\n  * Unmanaged switches offer no configuration. They\u2019re just dumb boxes that route network traffic. Any host connected to the switch can send network traffic to any other port on the switch.\n\nI wanted a plain old unmanaged switch. I\u2019ve never used a managed switch, and I\ndidn\u2019t want extra configuration to manage.\n\nIt turned out that none of the network switches that met my criteria were\nunmanaged, so I went with a managed switch. Once I got my managed switch, I\nfound that it was pretty fun to have VLANs for different devices on my\nnetwork. Now, I want to configure VLANs for everything!\n\n### PoE or standard Ethernet? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nCertain low-power devices can run entirely from the power they draw from the\nEthernet cable. This is called power over Ethernet (PoE).\n\nFor example, my home WiFi access point, the Ruckus R310, supports PoE, so it\nonly needs a single Ethernet cable for power and network connectivity.\n\nMy Ruckus R310 WiFi access point supports PoE, so it only needs a single\nEthernet cable for power and data.\n\nTo use PoE devices, you need a PoE-enabled networking switch.\n\nThe downside of PoE switches is that they consume more power and are more\nexpensive. If you buy a PoE switch but have no PoE devices, non-PoE devices\nwill still work, but you\u2019re wasting money and power on unnecessary features.\n\n### How many ports do you need? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nObviously, your switch needs at least as many ports as you have wired\nnetworking devices.\n\nThe harder question is figuring out how many extra ports to buy beyond your\ncurrent needs. The answer depends on your plans for growing your homelab in\nthe next few years.\n\nYou can buy additional switches later, but if you\u2019re buying an expensive\nswitch, you don\u2019t want to replace the entire thing in a couple of years. And\nyou don\u2019t want to lose another 1U of rack real estate to an additional switch\nwhen you could have bought a single switch with more ports.\n\nI currently have eight devices with Ethernet ports, so I looked for switches\nwith at least 16 ports.\n\n### Candidates \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nBrand| Model| Ports| Speed| Managed| PoE| Price  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nTP-Link| TL-SG3428X| 24| 4x10Gbps 24x1Gbps| Yes| No| $299.00  \nMicrotik| CRS328-24P-4S+RM| 28| 4x10 Gbps SFP+ 24x1Gbps| Yes| Yes| $490.50  \nTP-Link| Unnamed Chinese Model| 18| 2x10 Gbps SFP+ 16 x 2.5 Gbps| No| No|\n$499.90  \nTP-Link| T1600G-28TS| 24| 4x10 Gbps SFP 24x1Gbps| Yes| No| $299.00  \nTP-Link| T1600G-28PS| 24| 4x10 Gbps SFP 24x1Gbps| Yes| Yes| $295.99  \nTP-Link| T1700G-28TQ| 24| 4x10 Gbps SFP 24x1Gbps| Yes| No| $958.40  \n  \nI\u2019ve tried Microtik in the past, and I want to like them. They\u2019re a small,\nindependent hardware company. Some people love their weird 90s-style UI, but I\nfound it confusing and difficult to navigate.\n\nI want to like Microtik, but I can\u2019t get over their weird 90s-style admin UI\n\nI\u2019ve had great experience with unmanaged TP-Link switches, so I felt good\nabout the brand.\n\nI almost went with a 16 x 2.5 Gbps port TP-Link unit, but it\u2019s only available\nfrom China, and it doesn\u2019t seem to have any US safety or compliance\ncertification. I decided not to risk it.\n\nI considered the TP-Link T1600G-28PS, which had everything I liked about the\nTL-SG3428X, except it also had PoE. But I read several reviews that said the\nfans are loud, and I didn\u2019t want a noisy switch. I went with the TL-SG3428X\nand figured I could get a cheaper, silent unmanaged PoE switch, as I didn\u2019t\nneed 24 PoE ports.\n\n### Review: TP-Link TL-SG3428X \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n  * Grade: B-\n\nOverall, I like the TP-Link TL-SG3428X switch pretty well. It\u2019s silent, which\nis a big plus. I haven\u2019t had any issues with reliability. My experience with\nthe TP-Link web admin UI has been poor, but that\u2019s about standard for\nnetworking hardware.\n\nIt took me a long time to figure out how to configure VLANs. I\u2019ve seen how\nother brands like QNAP represent VLAN controls, and I think they did a much\nbetter job than TP-Link.\n\nThis page in the TP-Link web UI shows which ports are members of the Guest\nVLAN, but it always takes me a few minutes to remember how to interpret the\nscreen.\n\n### Review: Netgear GS116LP 16-Port unmanaged PoE switch \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n  * Grade: A\n\nI only have a handful of PoE devices, so I originally planned to power them\nwith a small 5-port PoE switch on a shelf. Late last year, I began prepping my\nwork office for our move-out, and I decided to adopt the Netgear GS116LP\nswitch from there.\n\nAs an unmanaged switch, it does what I need. It powers my devices, it was easy\nto install, and it\u2019s silent.\n\nIn retrospect, I should have tried harder to find one managed switch with PoE\nports instead of having two separate switches. I\u2019ll elaborate more below.\n\n## Choosing 10G NICs \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nIf you choose a 10 Gbps switch, your work isn\u2019t over. To achieve 10 Gbps\nspeeds, you need a 10G network interface controller (NIC) for each device you\nwant to run at 10 Gbps speeds. A regular 1 Gbps NIC will still work with a 10\nGbps switch, but it will be limited to 1 Gbps Ethernet.\n\nI had a lot of trouble finding 10G NICs for my systems. First, the market for\n10G NICs is almost entirely enterprise-grade data centers, so they cost nearly\n$1k each. I was able to find used NICs for under $100, but I had to scour\nforum posts for reports of buying different NICs used.\n\nI got a 10G NIC working on my Windows desktop after a bit of tinkering, but I\ntested three different NICs on my TrueNAS storage server, and I couldn\u2019t get\nany of them to work.\n\n  * Mellanox ConnextX-3 CX311A\n\n    * On my Windows desktop, the activity lights didn\u2019t flash, and Windows didn\u2019t recognize anything in the PCI slot.\n    * I found a forum post where someone mentioned that switching to another PCI slot on their motherboard solved the problem. I was skeptical, but that fixed it.\n    * My TrueNAS server couldn\u2019t recognize it at all.\n  * Chelsio T520-LL-CR\n\n    * Chelsio is one of the most common brands for TrueNAS servers, and Serve the Home listed it as a recommended option.\n    * My TrueNAS server couldn\u2019t recognize it.\n  * Chelsio Dual Port T520-CR\n\n    * My TrueNAS server couldn\u2019t recognize this one, either.\n\nMy best guess is that the motherbord on my TrueNAS server has limited\ncompatibility. It\u2019s a consumer-grade ASUS motherboard, so it may not support\nthese enterprise-oriented 10G NICs.\n\nI plan to build a new storage server in the next few months, so I\u2019ll try a\nfancier motherboard to see if that lets me use one of the three spare 10G NICs\nI\u2019ve now accrued.\n\nCurrently, the only 10 Gbps link in my network is between my Windows desktop\nand my managed switch. If I need to click a checkbox on TP-Link\u2019s crummy web\nUI, I can do it at blazing 10 Gbps speeds.\n\n## Choosing a UPS (battery backup) \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nWhen I lived in Manhattan, I\u2019d experience around five power outages per year.\nThey were all brief, but they were long enough to power cycle my computer and\nlose my work.\n\nTo avoid surprise shutdowns, I bought a battery backup system, also known as\nan uninterruptible power supply (UPS). It was an APC BR1500G, and I\u2019ve used\nthat same battery backup for six years.\n\nFor short power outages, the battery saves me from any downtime. For extended\noutages, the battery gives me enough time to shut down my systems to avoid\ndata loss.\n\nThe downside of the battery backup is that it added a lot of cabling to my\noffice. My desktop, servers, and router were all in different corners of my\noffice, so I had to run bulky, unsightly power cables everywhere.\n\n### How much time do you need for a graceful shutdown? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nFor extended power outages, you\u2019ll need enough time to shut down your systems\nbefore they exhaust your UPS\u2019 battery. The amount of time you need depends on\nthe size of your UPS\u2019 battery and the power draw of the systems attached to\nit.\n\nI theoretically could have used my Kill A Watt power meter to measure the\nwattage of each of my devices during typical operation and then used that to\nfind a battery. I was too lazy for that level of rigor, so I estimated based\non metrics from my previous UPS.\n\nMy APC UPS had an 865 W battery, and it reported 12 minutes of battery life\nwhile powering a desktop computer, a VM server, a storage server, a firewall,\nand a networking switch, so I thought 800 W would be a good minimum for the\nbattery.\n\n### Does it need to send alerts? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nAfter I set up my rack, a co-worker mentioned that most modern UPS systems can\nsend alerts to devices on the local network to tell them to shut down\ngracefully.\n\nFor me, automating shutdowns from my UPS isn\u2019t worth the trouble, but you\nmight choose differently if your systems are more sensitive to hard power cuts\nor if you\u2019re in an area where power outages are more frequent.\n\n### Candidates \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nBrand| Model| Power| Outlets| Price  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nCyberPower| CP1500PFCRM2U| 1000 W| 8| $335  \nTripp Lite| SMART1500LCD| 900 W| 8| $298  \nCyberPower| CPS1500AVR| 950 W| 8| $460  \n  \n### Review: CyberPower CP1500PFCRM2U \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n  * Grade: A\n\nThe CyberPower LCD is user-friendly and has useful metrics about power\nconsumption. You can also turn the display off to have fewer flashing lights\non your rack.\n\nThe UPS reports 30 minutes of battery life while powering a VM server, a\nstorage server, a firewall, and a networking switch. The total power draw of\nall these systems in a typical workload is 200 W.\n\nCyberPower offers PowerPanel Business, a free management tool for controlling\nthe UPS. To use it, you need to connect a computer to the UPS via a USB cable.\nIt\u2019s the kind of thing a Raspberry Pi would be great for, but CyberPower sadly\ndoesn\u2019t offer a way to install PowerPanel on ARM systems.\n\nI rate CyberPower\u2019s UPS management software as \"okay.\"\n\nI played with PowerPanel for a few minutes, and I thought it was okay but\nunnecessary. The quality is what you\u2019d expect from closed-source, vendor-\nspecific hardware management software. The physical controls on the UPS are\ngood enough for me.\n\nPowerPanel can run custom scripts when the UPS loses power, so I could\ntheoretically automate shutdowns of the devices in my rack, but it\u2019s not worth\nthe trouble in my environment.\n\nAnother plus is that the UPS is silent, which I thought was a given for\nbattery backups, but it turns out it\u2019s not...\n\n### Review: Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n  * Grade: D\n\nThe first UPS I purchased for my rack was the Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD, but it\nwas incredibly noisy.\n\nI didn\u2019t even realize battery backups could be noisy. My APC UPS is silent\nexcept when it loses power and fails over to the battery.\n\nNot only was the Tripp Lite UPS the loudest thing in my rack, it was the\nloudest thing in my whole house. It was like constantly having a hair dryer\nrunning in my office. My wife could hear it from her office a floor away.\n\nDid I just get a defective unit? Surely, a UPS can\u2019t be designed to be this\nloud all the time, right?\n\nI reached out to Tripp Lite customer support with a video of the UPS making\nnoise. They said that it was working as intended.\n\nI tried to get used to the noise, but it was so distracting that I gave up\nafter day two.\n\nTo my surprise, Newegg\u2019s return policy for the UPS was \u201creplacement only.\u201d I\u2019d\nalways had an easy return experience with Newegg so I didn\u2019t even think to\ncheck the return policy beforehand, but I guess they\u2019re more strict about\nthese 29 lb units.\n\nFortunately, I asked Newegg customer service nicely for a refund, and they\ngranted it, which is another reason I keep coming back to Newegg.\n\n## Choosing a power strip \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nEven though my rack has a UPS with many power outlets, I find it useful to\nhave a simple power strip as well.\n\nSome of the components in my rack are non-essential and don\u2019t need to stay\nonline during a power outage.\n\nFor example, I keep a little IoT device in my rack that monitors the\nperformance of my solar panels. That device is totally extraneous, so I\u2019m fine\nif it goes offline during a power failure. In fact, I prefer it to go offline\nbecause I don\u2019t want to squander limited battery capacity on a solar monitor.\n\n### Candidates \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nPower strips are, frankly, not so exciting, so I didn\u2019t shop around very much.\nI just looked at two.\n\nBrand| Model| Outlets| Price  \n---|---|---|---  \nTripp Lite| RS-1215-RA| 12| $78  \nCyberPower| CPS1215RMS| 12| $60  \n  \n### Review: Tripp Lite RS-1215-RA \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n  * Grade: B+\n\nThis power strip has worked well. The rear outlets have wide enough spacing\nthat brick-style power plugs don\u2019t block adjacent outlets.\n\nNothing in my rack plugs into the front outlets, but I occasionally find them\nuseful when I have a device I want to test for a few hours.\n\n### Review: CyberPower CPS1215RMS \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n  * Grade: C\n\nI bought this power strip a few years ago for the rack at my work office. My\nmain issue is that the outlets are too close together. A lot of the things I\nplug in at the office have wide power bricks, so they cover two outlets.\n\n## Choosing rack shelves \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nI already had a few existing components from my pre-rack life that I planned\nto bring into my rack, so I needed at least 2U of rack shelves for those\ncomponents.\n\n### Candidates \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nBrand| Model| Price  \n---|---|---  \nPyle| PLRSTN62U 19\" 2U| $64 for two  \nStarTech| CABSHELFV 2U 16\"| $88 for two  \n  \n### Review: Pyle PLRSTN62U rack shelves \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n  * Grade: A\n\nI had never heard of Pyle as a brand, but I found these shelves online, and\nthey\u2019ve worked out well.\n\nI keep non-mountable components on two 2U Pyle rack shelves.\n\nThey\u2019re easy to install, decently priced, and they have a lip that prevents\ncomponents from sliding off the shelf.\n\n### Review: StarTech CABSHELFV 2U rack shelves \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n  * Grade: D\n\nI originally purchased the StarTech shelves because StarTech has such a good\nreputation in the server world.\n\nWhen I installed them into my rack, I thought I must be misunderstanding how\nthey work. They have a bottom lip that bends downward into the next rack slot.\n\nStarTech shelves have a downward-facing lip whose sole purpose seems to be\nmessing up your rack layout.\n\nThis downward lip forces you to either allocate 3U to each of your 2U shelves\nor shift everything down by 0.5U.\n\nI couldn\u2019t even figure out a purpose for the lip. It would make sense if it\ncurved up because that would protect items on the shelf from slipping off, but\nwhy bend down? It didn\u2019t look like it provided any structural support to the\nshelf, either.\n\nI scoured reviews to see if anyone else was talking about this shelf\u2019s bizarre\ndesign choice. When other reviewers mentioned it, they didn\u2019t seem to mind.\nThe comments had the tone of, \u201cOh, yeah, it extends past 2U a bit. Whatevs.\u201d\n\nReviewer acknowledges that StarTech\u2019s 2U rack shelf takes up 3U of space,\nstill rates it 4 out of 5.\n\nI\u2019m baffled that anyone would accept a 2U shelf that takes up 3U of space. I\npromptly returned mine and bought the Pyle shelves instead.\n\n## Choosing a patch panel \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nFrom reading homelab blogs over the years, I noticed a lot of other\nhomelabbers integrating a patch panel into their racks.\n\nWhen it finally came time to build my server rack, I had to ask the question\nthat had been on my mind for ages.\n\n### What the heck is a patch panel? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nShopping around for patch panels made me even more confused. It\u2019s just a row\nof empty spaces? What\u2019s the point?\n\nThe concept didn\u2019t click for me until I built my rack. In short, the patch\npanel keeps the clutter of your networking cables behind your rack rather than\nin front of it.\n\nPatch panels keep the front of your rack clean by routing network cables to\nthe rear of the rack.\n\nTip: I recommend having a patch panel adjacent to every switch in your rack.\n\n### Candidates \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nBrand| Model| Price  \n---|---|---  \nNewYork Cables| 24-Port 1U| $19  \nTripp Lite| 16-Port 1U| $13  \n  \n### Review: NewYork Cables 24-Port 1U Patch Panel \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n  * Grade: B+\n\nAt the end of the day, a patch panel is just some metal and plastic, so\nthere\u2019s not much to do well or poorly. But the NewYork model feels sturdy and\ninstalls into the rack well.\n\nOne of the reasons I chose the NewYork brand patch panel was that I saw\nreviews mention a rear bar that helps support Ethernet cables. In my rack, the\nrear bar doesn\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s too close to the Ethernet ports to provide\nsupport, and they don\u2019t seem to need it anyway.\n\nI thought the rear bar of the patch panel would help support my Ethernet\ncables, but they turned out not to need it.\n\nMy one complaint is with the port labels. They\u2019re slips of paper under\nplastic, like a landline phone would have for speed dial in the 90s. Other\npatch panels have little whiteboard strips for easy erasing, and I prefer that\nstyle to strips of paper.\n\nThe labels on the NewYork patch panel are like the little speed dial labels\nthat landline phones had in the 90s.\n\n### Review: Tripp Lite 16-port 1U Patch Panel \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n  * Grade: A\n\nAs with the NewYork cables patch panel, the Tripp Lite model is fine, but\nthere\u2019s not much to get excited about with patch panels.\n\nI like that the labels are tiny whiteboards. I had whiteboard markers on hand,\nbut they were too big to write in such tight spaces, so I bought ultra fine-\ntip whiteboard markers, and those worked well.\n\nThe Tripp Lite patch panel features tiny labels you can write on with ultra\nfine-tip whiteboard markers.\n\n## Choosing a Raspberry Pi rack mount \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nI do a lot of professional and hobby projects with the Raspberry Pi, a small,\ninexpensive single-board computer.\n\nI\u2019d seen rack mounts for the Raspberry Pi, so I thought it would be fun to add\none to my rack. I didn\u2019t feel like shopping around for Pi racks, so I just\nbought the first one that looked decent.\n\nBrand| Model| Price  \n---|---|---  \nUCTRONICS| Ultimate Rack with PoE Functionality| $190  \n  \n### Review: UCTRONICS Ultimate Rack \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n  * Grade: C+\n\nThe rack mount is okay, not great.\n\nIt\u2019s a decent value for the price. PoE HATs for a Raspberry Pi 4 are generally\naround $20, so getting four PoE HATs is already an $80 value. And then you\u2019re\nalso getting the rack mount itself, four microSD extenders, four HDMI\nextenders, four OLED screens, and four fans.\n\nThe craftsmanship on the rack mount itself is mediocre. The pieces don\u2019t fit\ntogether that well. There are noticeable gaps around the HDMI and microSD\nports.\n\nThe UCTRONICS Pi rack mount had significant gaps around the HDMI and microSD\nports.\n\nThe HDMI ports are also secured poorly to the mount. When I plug in an HDMI\ncable, the connector bends and strains. I worry they\u2019re going to snap off one\nday.\n\nPoE generates extra heat, so it\u2019s good that these come with an integrated fan,\nbut they create a constant high-pitch whirring. I keep all the fans powered\noff. The Pi could overheat without the fan, but it just means the CPU\nthrottles or shuts down, which isn\u2019t a big deal for my hobby projects.\n\nThe instructions are terrible. Step one is to screw in the OLED. Okay, that\u2019s\nfine. Step two is to screw in the power button. Sure, easy peasy. Step three\nis to put together the five remaining components simultaneously.\n\nThe UCTRONICS Pi rack mount instructions rapidly increase in difficulty.\n\n## Choosing Ethernet cables \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nIf you\u2019re converting an existing setup to a server rack, you\u2019ll likely need\nnew Ethernet cables. For a patch panel, remember to buy short (6-12\") cables\n(sometimes called \u201cpatch cables\u201d) to connect the patch panel to your switch.\n\nYou\u2019ll likely need a mix of different patch cable lengths. For example, on my\nrack, port 16 on my switch is just 1.5\" from port 16 on my patch panel, but\nport 1 on my switch is 6\" from its corresponding patch panel port.\n\nConsider that the distance between ports on your switch and patch panel may\nvary depending on the port layout of each component.\n\nI bought 6\", 12\", and 3\u2019 Ethernet cables at a ratio of about 5:2:1.\n\nSome people are creative and buy different colors to represent different\nfunctionality. I\u2019m boring and just stuck with blue and black Ethernet cables\nbecause they look standard and proper to me.\n\n## Choosing fiber cables \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n### Ethernet, DAC, or fiber? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nIf you\u2019re building a 1 Gbps network, you can buy regular RJ45 Ethernet cables\nand call it a day.\n\nIf you go above 1 Gbps speeds, you have to choose between Ethernet and fiber\ncables.\n\nWith Ethernet, it\u2019s simple. Your Ethernet adapter has an Ethernet port, so you\nplug in an Ethernet cable. Easy peasy!\n\nWith fiber, cabling is more complicated.\n\nA fiber networking device will have an SFP or SFP+ port, but there\u2019s no such\nthing as an SFP or SFP+ cable. You need to convert SFP/SFP+ to something else.\n\nMy network switch and 10G NICs all had SFP+ ports, so I knew the connections\nhad to start and end with SFP+. That meant my connection would look like:\n\n  1. SFP+ port on my network switch\n  2. SFP+ to something transceiver\n  3. something cable\n  4. SFP+ to something transceiver\n  5. SFP+ port on my 10G NIC\n\nI\u2019d need to convert SFP+ to something else to connect the two ends. The\noptions were:\n\n  1. RJ45 (Ethernet)\n  2. LC (Fiber)\n  3. DAC (Copper)\n\nThe connection had to run through my patch panel. I found patch keys for\nEthernet and fiber but nothing for DAC. I\u2019m still unsure if DAC fiber keys\ndon\u2019t exist or if there\u2019s some other way I\u2019m missing to run them through a\npatch panel.\n\nThat reduced my options to just to just RJ45 or LC.\n\n### Ethernet vs. fiber \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nI couldn\u2019t find many practical differences between RJ45 and LC. LC is thinner,\nso I find it a bit more visually appealing, but it means a different type of\ncable than all my other components, which are Ethernet.\n\nI was surprised at the difference in pricing between Ethernet and fiber. SFP+\nto RJ45 transceivers were significantly more expensive than SFP+ to fiber, but\nEthernet cables are cheaper than fiber cables.\n\nWhen I priced everything out, cost was significantly lower for fiber:\n\nComponent| Ethernet price| Fiber price  \n---|---|---  \nThree transceivers (for my switch, desktop, and storage server)| $150| $60  \nOne 16\u2019 cable (desktop to switch)| $9| $15  \nOne 3\u2019 cable (storage server to switch)| $7| $10  \nTwo 7\" patch cables| $0*| $30  \nFour patch keys| $0*| $19  \nTotal| $163| $134  \n  \n* These effectively would cost no extra money because I had to buy these for the rest of the ports in my switch.\n\nGotcha: If you use fiber, make sure that your cables and transceivers match in\n\u201cmode.\u201d You can\u2019t mix single mode fiber with multimode fiber. I recommend\nbuilding a multimode system, as it supports 10 Gbps speeds and is\nsignificantly less expensive than single mode.\n\nI\u2019ve included all the cables I purchased below.\n\n## What I already had \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n### Router: Qotom Q355G4 with OPNsense \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nMy home router is a cheap Qotom Q355G4 unit running OPNsense. It doesn\u2019t have\nrack mounts, so now it lives on its own dedicated rack shelf.\n\nMy OPNsense firewall running on Qotom Q355G4 mini PC\n\n### WiFi access point: Ruckus R310 \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nMy access point doesn\u2019t technically live in my rack, but it plugs in to my PoE\nswitch. It\u2019s a nice access point, and it allows me to create multiple WiFi\nnetworks with different VLAN tags, so my guest WiFi has Internet access but\ncan\u2019t reach any of my other devices.\n\nMy Ruckus R310 WiFi access point\n\n### Out-of-band management: TinyPilot Voyager 2a PoE \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nFull disclosure: TinyPilot is a product I created and now sell.\n\nI generally connect to components in my rack over SSH or web interfaces. When\nI reinstall an OS, change boot settings, or fix network settings, I need\ncontrol at the physical level.\n\nInstead of having to drag a keyboard and monitor over to my rack, I can plug\nin my TinyPilot Voyager 2a when I need hardware-level access:\n\nI use TinyPilot to get physical-level access to my homelab servers through the\nbrowser.\n\n### Software testing: Dell Optiplex 7040 mini PC \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nFor development work on TinyPilot, I often test new software features by\nremotely controlling a real device. This Dell mini PC is a handy test device\nbecause I can frequently reboot it or blow away the OS without disrupting any\nother work.\n\n## How do I arrange components in a rack? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nOnce I selected my rack components, the next step was figuring out how to lay\neverything out. I couldn\u2019t find established best practices for arranging\ncomponents, so I just reasoned out what made sense to me.\n\nTo plan the layout, I used a spreadsheet and color-coded it. This was also\nhelpful in thinking about what size rack to purchase.\n\nI considered different rack layouts by just swapping elements in a\nspreadsheet.\n\n### Place heavy components on the bottom of your rack \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nThere was one rule everyone seemed to agree on: mount the heaviest components\non the bottom.\n\nThe rack has a lot of expensive equipment. You don\u2019t want it to fall over and\ndamage things or, worse, injure someone. So, you want it to have a low center\nof gravity to maximize stability.\n\nThe heaviest component in my rack, by far, is the UPS, weighing in at a\nwhopping 27 lbs.\n\nPatch panels weigh almost nothing, and networking switches are fairly light as\nwell. For this reason, most server racks keep these components in the top two\nslots of the rack.\n\n### Keep components with front-facing connections close together \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nIt wasn\u2019t obvious until I built my server, but it\u2019s important to cluster\ncomponents that connect through front-facing ports. For example, my patch\npanel and networking switch go in adjacent rack slots, because I\u2019d otherwise\nhave Ethernet cables stretched over other components in the rack.\n\n### Rear cables don\u2019t matter so much \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nSome of the guidance I read said to arrange components so that you can\nminimize the length of your power cables. I didn\u2019t see the point.\n\nMaybe minimizing cable length is important in a data center where you\u2019re\nreplicating the same setup hundreds of times. In a home environment, I don\u2019t\nsee the difference between connecting my server to my UPS with a 2 ft. power\ncable vs. a 4 ft. power cable.\n\n## My final rack setup \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nComponent| Choice| Price| Satisfaction  \n---|---|---|---  \nServer rack| StarTech 4POSTRACK18U| $316| A  \nNetwork switch (managed)| TP-Link TL-SG3428X| $299| C+  \nNetwork switch (PoE, unmanaged)| Netgear GS116LP| $139| A  \nUPS| CyberPower CP1500PFCRM2U| $335| A+  \nPower strip| Tripp Lite RS-1215-RA| $78| B+  \nRack shelves| Pyle PLRSTN62U 19\" 2U| $64| A  \nPatch panel (24-port)| NewYork Cables 1U| $19| B+  \nPatch panel (16-port)| Tripp Lite 1U| $13| A  \nRaspberry Pi rack mount| UCTRONICS Ultimate Rack with PoE Functionality| $190|\nC+  \nTotal| $1,453  \n  \nAnd here are the smaller items:\n\nComponent| Price  \n---|---  \nCable Matters SFP+ to LC multimode fiber transceiver (2-pack)| $40  \nCat6 keystone coupler (25-pack)| $23  \nFiber LC coupler (5-pack)| $19  \n12\" Ethernet cables (10-pack)| $19  \n6\" Ethernet cables (25-pack)| $34  \n16\u2019 fiber LC mulitmode cable| $14  \n3\u2019 fiber LC multimode cable| $10  \n8\" fiber LC mulitmode patch cables (5-pack)| $30  \nNavePoint M6 cage nuts| $16  \n  \n## Next steps in my rack \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n### Rack-mounted server \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nYou may have noticed that my server rack is conspicuously missing one common\ncomponent: a server.\n\nI still have my pre-rack VM and storage servers. I\u2019ll migrate them to rack-\nmounted chassis the next time I do some upgrades, but I\u2019ve punted that task\nsince building the rack was a significant enough project on its own.\n\n### Are there hats for my rack? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nOne of the things I\u2019ve been searching for without success is a \u201chat\u201d for my\nrack. The top of my rack is just open space.\n\nI\u2019d love to find a top that fits securely into the open space on top of my\nrack and lets me store things on it.\n\nIf you know a solution to this, let me know.\n\n## Avoiding mistakes I made \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n### Test the UPS before mounting it \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nThe UPS was, by far, the most difficult component to mount in the rack. I\ndon\u2019t understand how people do it. It\u2019s about half the size of a window air\nconditioner, but to install it, you need one hand holding it perfectly level\nand another hand screwing it in. I eventually decided it was a two-person job\nand called my wife in for reinforcements.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to go through all the work of mounting a heavy UPS only to\ndiscover that it\u2019s unbearably loud. Or it could just be a dead device, and you\ndon\u2019t want to find that out after you mount it.\n\n### Check UPS reviews for noise complaints \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nSome UPS devices are totally silent, and some produce constant noise. If the\nUPS will be anywhere near you, take noise into consideration.\n\n### Check return policies \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nI\u2019d never seen anything on Newegg before that was replacement-only, so I took\nit for granted that I\u2019d be able to return my UPS if I didn\u2019t like it.\n\nLuckily, Newegg customer service was helpful and accepted the return for a\nrefund, but I\u2019ll check proactively in the future.\n\n### Get a PoE-enabled switch if you have any PoE components \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nCurrently, I have 2U of network switches and 2U of patch panels, and I\u2019m only\nusing 11 of the 44 ports.\n\nI regret not looking around more for a managed switch that supported PoE while\nstill offering quiet operation. My ideal would be to have a fanless managed\nswitch where at least eight of the ports have PoE and at least three have 10\nGbps speeds.\n\n### Cage nuts aren\u2019t supposed to hurt \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nWhen you install components into your rack, you secure it to your rack using a\ncage screw and cage nut.\n\nI thought cage nuts worked like all other nuts I\u2019ve ever encountered \u2014 I hold\nthem behind the thing I\u2019m screwing into and then tighten the screw into the\nnut.\n\nHow I was incorrectly installing cage nuts\n\nAfter installing about eight cage nuts, I cursed the stupidity of whoever\ndecided to put sharp corners on a thing that required me to squeeze it between\nmy fingertips. And then I realized I might be doing something wrong.\n\nTip: If you find yourself exerting a lot of force or feeling physical pain\nwhile building computer hardware, you\u2019re probably doing something wrong.\nServer equipment is designed so that middle-aged, out-of-shape IT people can\nuse it, so you don\u2019t need peak physical fitness.\n\nCage nuts have a clever design in that they clip into the rack. That way, you\ndon\u2019t have to hold the nut in place when screwing the component into your\nrack.\n\nThe correct way to install cage nuts is to let them clip in from behind the\nhole in the rack post.\n\n### Don\u2019t install patch keys backward \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nI\u2019m going to sound like a moron here, but I installed my patch panel keys\nincorrectly twice before I realized how to do it correctly.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve seen the right way, what I thought was correct before looks\nabsurd, but it\u2019s my first rack!\n\nSo, my first attempt was like this:\n\nIt fit snugly, and it was easy to plug Ethernet cables into it, so I thought\nthat was right. But almost every time I removed an Ethernet cable, the patch\nkey popped out with it.\n\n\u201cI must have done this backward,\u201d I thought. So I plugged the keys in from the\nrear. It was tougher to get them in, but they stayed in place better.\n\nEmbarrassingly, I thought this was how RJ45 patch keys were supposed to work\nfor about six months.\n\nI had them like this for six months!\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I bought my second patch panel and experimented with the keys\nthat I realized there was a different method.\n\nIt turns out that the little notch on the top isn\u2019t for decoration. You\u2019ll\nhear a little click when the notch clicks into the correct position. The front\nface should be roughly flush with the front of the patch panel.\n\nPatch keys should be flush with the face of the patch panel, and their tabs\nclick into place in the rear.\n\n### If the motherboard doesn\u2019t detect a 10G NIC, try a different PCI slot \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nWhen I installed my Mellanox 10G NIC into my desktop, Windows didn\u2019t detect it\nat all. I tried re-seating it, and I saw the same results. I tried downloading\nthe latest drivers, but Windows didn\u2019t show the NIC in Device Manager.\n\nFinally, I stumbled across a forum post where someone reported that their\nMellanox card worked when they switched it to a different PCI slot. I tried a\ndifferent PCI slot on my motherboard, and voila! It worked perfectly.\n\nI still don\u2019t understand why the PCI slot mattered. According to my\nmotherboard\u2019s documentation, the two PCI slots are supposed to be identical,\nbut one worked, and the other didn\u2019t.\n\n### Don\u2019t mix SFP+ multimode and single mode fiber cables \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nThe first day that I installed my Mellanox NIC on my Windows desktop,\neverything worked fine.\n\nAfter about 24 hours, my desktop\u2019s Ethernet connection suddenly began\ndisconnecting and reconnecting every few seconds. I rebooted, and the problem\nwent away.\n\nA day later, the problem came back. I tried connecting the cable from my\ndesktop directly to the switch, skipping the patch panel. That fixed the\nissue, which narrowed the problem to either the patch cable or the patch panel\nkey.\n\nFinally, I spotted it: my patch cables were single mode, whereas the rest of\nmy system was multimode. I didn\u2019t even know there were different \u201cmodes\u201d of\nfiber cables, but apparently there are, and they don\u2019t get along.\n\nMy network connection went into a reset loop every 24 hours because I\naccidentally used multimode patch cables in a single mode fiber system.\n\nI bought a new set of multimode fiber cables, and the problem went away.\nUnfortunately, I discovered the problem three days after the return window for\nmy $70 box of single mode fiber cables had closed.\n\n### Consider used equipment \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nOne blind spot in this guide is that I didn\u2019t explore used equipment aside\nfrom the 10G NICs.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly a \u201cmistake\u201d to buy new equipment, as I did it consciously\nand am happy with the choice. I optimized for time over money, and it was\nfaster for me to search for components at retailers like Newegg rather than on\nmarketplaces for used equipment like eBay, Facebook, or craigslist.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to invest a bit more time, you can dramatically reduce the\ncost of your rack by finding used equipment.\n\n## My life with a rack \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nI\u2019m happy with my new rack and have no regrets about the investment. It\ndefinitely beats my old setup of having bits and pieces of infrastructure\nscattered around my office.\n\nNow, everything lives in one efficient, organized location. When people visit\nmy house, I look like a quirky nerd rather than a weird slob with cables\neverywhere.\n\nI underestimated how nice it would be to have my TinyPilot physically close to\nall of my devices (disclosure again: TinyPilot is a product I created). Before\nthe rack, I used to keep my TinyPilot on the floor next to my desk. There was\na lot of friction in using it to fix server issues: I had to shut down the\nTinyPilot, disconnect a bunch of wires, reconnect it on the other side of the\nroom, then undo everything after I was done.\n\nWith everything now physically adjacent, it\u2019s easy for me to quickly plug\nTinyPilot in to any misbehaving device for low-level access. It came in handy\nfor things like figuring out how to install NixOS on a Raspberry Pi and\nupgrading my VM server to the latest version of Proxmox.\n\n### Be the first to know when I post cool stuff\n\nSubscribe to get my latest posts by email.\n\nThanks for signing up!
