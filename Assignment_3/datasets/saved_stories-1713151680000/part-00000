Yet his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party\nhas failed to attract many voters in the more prosperous south. The regional\ndivergence is not unique to the BJP. Throughout India\u2019s long history, rulers\nhave tried and failed to unite the subcontinent under central authority. The\nchief reason is India\u2019s diversity, summed up in clich\u00e9s about dozens of\ncuisines, hundreds of languages and thousands of gods. The clich\u00e9s may be\ntrite, but they are also useful. A whirlwind tour through 2,500 years of\nIndian history helps explain why.\n\nThe history of pre-independence India is often divided into Hindu, Muslim and\nBritish periods. The first ruler to establish a pan-Indian empire, building on\nthe work of his grandfather Chandragupta Maurya, was Ashoka (see map 1), but\nat unfathomable human cost. Also known as Ashoka the Great, he converted to\nBuddhism after reckoning with the brutality his territorial expansion had\nengendered. He remains a revered figure even today for uniting the country and\nfor his largely benevolent rule after converting. His four-headed-lion capital\n(column head) is the official emblem of the Republic of India, and his\n\u201cchakra\u201d, or wheel, a Buddhist symbol, sits at the centre of the Indian flag.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get the full story\n\n### Enjoy a month of insightful analysis for free.
