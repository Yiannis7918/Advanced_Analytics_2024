JPMorgan.\n  * The investment bank estimates 670,000 bpd of Russian refining capacity is currently offline due to the strikes.\n  * Kyiv's capabilities are growing, with drones demonstrating a longer

Russia's\nattack on Ukraine, in Ryazan, Ryazan Region, Russia, in this screen grab from\na video obtained by Reuters, March 13, 2024.\n\nVideo Obtained By Reuters | Via Reuters\n\nUkraine's campaign of attacks against Russian oil refineries is demonstrating\nhow relatively cheap drones that utilize artificial intelligence could pose a\nmajor threat to global energy markets.\n\nUkraine-launched drones have hit 18 Russian oil refineries this year with a\ncombined capacity of 3.9 million barrels per day, according to report\npublished by JPMorgan earlier this month. Some 670,000 bpd of Russian refining\ncapacity is currently offline due to the strikes, according to the bank.\n\nUkraine's capabilities are growing with its drones now demonstrating a\nsubstantially longer range. Earlier this month, Kyiv hit Russia's third-\nlargest oil refinery, Taneco, which is located up to 1,300 kilometers \u2014\nroughly 800 miles \u2014 from the frontlines, according to JPMorgan.\n\nUkraine is increasingly using drones that are enabled with AI, which helps the\nweapons navigate and avoid jamming, according to the bank.\n\n\"The AI guidance also delivers strike precision, maximizing the impact of the\nstrikes by targeting specific areas like distillation towers, repairs of which\nrequires Western technology,\" Natasha Kaneva, head of global commodities\nstrategy at JPMorgan, told clients in the April report. \"This makes the\nrepairs costly and often require equipment that the country is not able to\nproduce.\"\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made clear Tuesday that the Biden\nadministration is worried about the strikes in a rare airing of public\ndisagreement with U.S. allies in Kyiv.\n\n\"Certainly, those attacks could have a knock-on effect in terms of the global\nenergy situation,\" Austin told the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"Quite\nfrankly, I think Ukraine is better served in going after tactical and\noperational targets that can directly influence the current fight.\"\n\nThe U.S. has urged Ukraine to stop the attacks on Russian energy\ninfrastructure out of concern that they could drive up crude oil prices and\ninstigate retaliation from Moscow, three people familiar with the discussions\ntold the Financial Times last month.\n\nThe losses to Russian refining capacity could worsen as Ukraine aims to build\na full-fledge drone industry and produce a million units domestically this\nyear, according to the JPMorgan report. If Kyiv is able to extend the drones'\nrange to 1,500 kilometers (about 932 miles), they could potentially hit 21\nrefineries with more than 4.4 million bpd of refined capacity, according to\nthe report.\n\n\"There's room for this to become a bigger problem, because we've come to count\non Russian supply getting to the global market, which allows other non-Russian\nsupply to go to other places,\" said John Kilduff, an energy expert and\nfounding partner at Again Capital.\n\nThe deployment of AI drones also has broader implications for global energy\nmarkets, according to Bob Brackett, a senior research analyst at Bernstein.\nThe drones are cheap to produce compared to the millions of dollars in damage\nthey can cause and could empower nonstate actors to challenge superior\nfighting forces, Brackett told clients in Friday note.\n\n\"These drones can easily and asymmetrically disrupt global seaborne trade,\"\nBrackett wrote, warning that oil exporters such as Russia aren't the only\ncountries that need to be worried. Oil importers, like China and India, will\nnow have to worry about disruptions to crude flows from drone attacks, he\nsaid.\n\n## Impact on oil, gasoline prices\n\nUkraine's campaign of drone strikes comes at the same time as tensions are\nrunning red hot in the Middle East, with OPEC member Iran and Israel now\nteetering on the brink of a direct confrontation.\n\nU.S. crude oil has rallied nearly 20% this year, while the global benchmark\nBrent has gained 17% as the wars in Middle East and Eastern Europe rage\nagainst the backdrop of rising crude demand and tightening supply. Gasoline\nfutures have surged about 33% since the year began.\n\nBob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy, said the drone strikes are not a\nmajor issue for oil prices right now because the attacks on refineries are\nprimarily affecting Russia's production of diesel at a time when the market is\nalready glutted.\n\nBut Russia is also major exporter of a gasoline feedstock called naphtha. If\nnaphta markets were to tighten because of the attacks it could have an impact\non gas prices and balances, said McNally, who served as a senior energy\nofficial in the George W. Bush administration.\n\nGoldman Sachs said in a research note last month that the strikes are bullish\nfor diesel prices, but the impact on crude oil is mixed. Outages can lead to\nreduced oil demand from refineries, which is bearish for prices. But the\nmarket is worried Ukraine could increasingly hit oil production and\ntransportation infrastructure, which would weigh on Russian crude exports,\naccording to Goldman.\n\nBart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, said the current\nstrikes could have an indirect effect on oil markets. As Russian fuel exports\ndecline due to the attacks, countries that rely on those exports then need to\nsource fuel from refineries in other jurisdictions, Melek said. Those refiners\nneed more crude to meet the demand which can stress oil supplies, he said.\n\nRussian production already poses a problem for the Biden administration.\nMoscow has pledged to cut its oil output and exports by an additional 471,000\nbarrels per day in the second quarter to meet its commitments to OPEC+.\n\nThose cuts could push the price of Brent crude to $100 by September, which\nwill put pressure on the Biden administration just before the presidential\nelection, according to a JPMorgan report last month.\n\nThe investment bank expects U.S. gas prices to hit $4 per gallon by May, the\nhighest level since the summer of 2022.\n\n\"There are few issues that terrify a sitting American president in an election\nyear more than surging gasoline prices,\" said Rapidan's McNally.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Friday's biggest analyst calls: Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, Boeing, First Solar, Schwab & more\n  * Citi says this \u2018high risk\u2019 but \u2018attractive\u2019 global stock has 280% upside\n  * This AI stock could fall 50% and has an \u2018exaggerated artificial intelligence narrative,\u2019 Morningstar says\n  * Morgan Stanley names 3 overlooked global tech stocks, giving one almost 100% upside\n\n\\-- CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
