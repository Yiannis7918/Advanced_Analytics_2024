What happens next?\n\n.Pp\n\nPractical UNIX Manuals: mdoc is a guide for writing portable and maintainable\nUNIX manuals (\"manpages\") in the mdoc language.\n\n.Pp\n\nWhy mdoc? Formatters for the language are available by default on all modern\nUNIX installations and may be downloaded for non-UNIX systems. Furthermore,\nmdoc annotates content semantically, not presentationally, producing\nconsistent manpages across systems. For an analysis of mdoc and competing\nformats, refer to Fixing on a Standard Language for UNIX Manuals, published in\nthe USENIX magazine.\n\n.Pp\n\nThis book is structured first as a series of tutorials, then a guide to best\npractises: it is not a reference! For that, refer to your local mdoc manual.\n\n.Pp\n\nI also feature the History of UNIX Manpages, which chronicles the development\nof manpages from the 1960s to the present day.\n\n.\n\nAll content licensed under Creative Commons' Attribution Share-Alike: deriving\nworks must attribute the author, Kristaps Dzonsons, and use a similar license.\nCitations should include the current version, 0.1.4, and date, 07 April 2014.\n\n.\n\n.ShPractical UNIX Manuals: mdoc\n\n.\n\n.SsOn-line\n\n.Bd -unfilled\n\n.LkTable of Contents: tree of HTML documents\n\n.LkFull Text: single HTML document\n\n.Ed\n\n.SsOff-line\n\n.Bd -unfilled\n\n.Lke-Book: e-Pub 2.0.1 archive\n\n.LkDocument Tree: archive of HTML tree\n\n.LkSingle Document: archive of HTML document\n\n.Ed\n\n.ShThe History of UNIX Manpages\n\n.\n\n.SsOn-line\n\n.Bd -unfilled\n\n.LkFull Text: single HTML document\n\n.Ed\n\n.ShNews\n\n.Bl -ohang\n\n.It07 April 2014, 0.1.4\n\nPolished (editing) text in various places.
