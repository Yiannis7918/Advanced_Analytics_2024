Only three of them marked bold are generally accepted as\ntwinning laws. These laws are either very common in crystals (Dauphin\u00e9 Law,\nBrazil Law) or, although much rarer, have at least been found on a regular\nbasis and in sufficient numbers, and are associated with certain growth forms\nand environmental conditions (Japan Law). There is some debate on whether some\nof the other twinning laws (marked italic) in fact exist in nature, others\nhave been shown to be not of law-like nature.\n\nTwinning Axis| Twinning Plane| Composition Plane| Type| Handedness of\nSubindividuals  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nDauphin\u00e9 Law| [ 0 0 0 1 ]| -| { 1 0 1 0 }| Penetration| R+R or L+L  \nBrazil Law| -| { 1 1 2 0 }| { 1 1 2 0 }| Contact / Penetration| L+R  \nJapan Law| -| { 1 1 2 2 }| { 1 1 2 2 }| Contact| all combinations  \n\"Liebisch Law\" or \"Combined Law\"| [ 0 0 0 1 ]| { 1 1 2 0 }| -| \"Mixed\"| L+R  \nEsterel Law| -| { 1 0 1 1 }| { 1 0 1 1 }| Contact ?| ?  \nSardinia Law| -| { 1 0 1 2 }| { 1 0 1 2 }| Contact ?| ?  \nBreithaupt Law| -| { 1 1 2 1 }| { 1 1 2 1 }| Contact ?| ?  \n  \nThe data for this table have been taken mostly from Gault, 1949, albeit with a\nfew corrections.\n\nAlthough, for example, Japan Law twin is the correct nomenclature, I sometimes\nalso use the term \"Japanese Twin\" and likewise \"Brazil twin\" and \"Dauphin\u00e9\nTwin\", as these terms are much more common among rockhounds.\n\nA single crystal can be twinned in many ways, parts of it may show Dauphin\u00e9\ntwinning, other parts Brazil twinning. In fact combinations of Brazil and\nDauphin\u00e9 twin portions in a single crystal aren't that uncommon, and sometimes\nyou see references to a Liebisch or Combined Law. Although the shape of the\ncrystals suggests the presence of a \"Combined Twins\", these combinations do\nnot qualify as a twinning law by themselves, because it has been shown in\nelectron microscopic studies that a left-handed part never borders a right-\nhanded part that has been rotated around the c-axis.\n\n### Identifying Twins\n\nThere are complex methods to determine if and how a crystal is twinned, but a\nrockhound has to rely solely on crystal morphology. The characteristics of\neach twinning type will be described below, but beforehand I will briefly\nmention the four general properties of quartz crystals that help identifying\ntwins:\n\n  * Position of x-faces Reliable, but the x-face is not very common.\n\n  * Position of s-faces The s-face is more common than the x-face, but one can only identify its relative position when it shows a striation. Very often the s-face is a perfect plane.\n\n  * Surface patterns caused by etching This is very reliable, but it doesn't tell you the orientation of the crystal subindividuals. For example, you might identify a Dauphin\u00e9 twin but can't tell if it's a left or right quartz.\n\n  * Oriented indentations on the surface Reliable, but difficult to interpret, because the form of the dents also depends on the type of face.\n\nOf course, if one relies only on these criteria one will miss many twinned\ncrystals because of their \"boring\" morphology. Sometimes you can tell that a\ncrystal is twinned, but it's impossible to tell how.\n\nOften you read that so called sutures coincide with twin boundaries. Sutures\nare more or less irregular crack-like lines visible on the crystal faces. They\noften are the boundaries between slightly displaced crystal subindividuals of\nsimilar orientation, which lie almost parallel to each other. These sutures\nare most easily observed on the m-faces of crystals with macromosaic\nstructure.\n\nThe sutures visible on the m-faces of Japanese twins are in fact the boundary\nbetween the two twin crystals oriented differently in a law-like manner. But\nsutures do not indicate twin boundary between left and right-handed crystals.\nSutures can only form when the neighboring crystal subindividuals show a\ndifferent orientation. Left and right handed quartz crystals do not differ in\ntheir orientation with respect to the a- and c-axes, so in a twinned crystal\nthe subindividuals lie perfectly parallel to each other (but with their\ncrystal lattice either rotated or mirrored with respect to each other). If you\nsee a suture, you see a slight misorientation of the two subindividuals, and\ntheir boundaries cannot coincide with a twinning plane that corresponds to a\nspecific, law-like intergrowth.\n\n### Dauphin\u00e9 Law Twins\n\nH.264-movie, 256x256 px: dauphine_twin_1.mp4 372kb  \n---  \n  \nIn a Dauphin\u00e9 Law twin either only right or only left handed quartz structures\nare combined in a crystal. The subindividuals are rotated around the c-axis by\n60\u00b0 relative to each other. In a Dauphin\u00e9 Law twin the r and z rhombohedra\ncannot be distinguished, and accordingly Dauphin\u00e9 Law twins often display a\npseudohexagonal habit^[1].\n\nDauphin\u00e9 Law twins are electrical twins: their optical properties are similar\nto untwinned crystals, but mechanical pressure along the a axis does not cause\nan electrostatic polarization of the crystals. Dauphin\u00e9 Law twin domains\ncannot be visualized in polarized light, because adjacent domains have the\nsame handedness and rotate the light's polarization planes in the same\ndirection.\n\nDauphin\u00e9 Law twins are penetration twins: the twin domains are intensely\nintergrown in most cases. The boundary between the twin subindividuals appear\nirregular, as shown schematically in the right figure that depicts a cross\nsection of a crystal. The size and shape of the twin domains can vary and the\nshares of the twin domains in a crystal don't have to be equal. Such a pattern\ncan be visualized by etching a cross section. On a microscopical scale, the\ntwin domains do not look irregular, but like complex polygons with straight\nboundaries (Lang, 1965, McLaren and Phakey, 1969).\n\nIn many crystals the pattern of domains gets more complex and irregular\ntowards the tips of the crystal, while the base is made of a few twin domains\nthat may be arranged as roughly triangular sectors (Friedlaender, 1951).\n\n10mm 720x968 73kb - 1440x1936 213kb  \n---  \n  \nA right-handed smoky quartz Dauphin\u00e9 twin with an almost ideal development of\ntriangular x-faces. It is from the Val Giuv valley, Graub\u00fcnden, Switzerland.\n\n5mm 960x960 109kb - 1920x1920 298kb  \n---  \n  \nThis is a top view of a transparent smoky quartz crystal from the western\nErongo mountains in Namibia. The crystal is from a miarole pocket and has been\netched by aggressive hot fluids. The strange looking pattern on its surface\ndeveloped because r- and z-rhombohedral faces were effected by the fluids to a\ndifferent degree. Because the crystal is a Dauphin\u00e9 twin, and Dauphin\u00e9 twins\nare penetration twins, each of the faces represents a mosaic of irregular r-\nand z-rhombohedral parts (just like the entire crystal is an irregularly\nlooking mosaic). Unfortunately, there is no simple method to determine if the\nbright patches correspond to r- or z-faces.\n\n960x960 122kb  \n---  \n  \nYou will note that each irregular patch has a straight border at the edge of a\ncrystal face. The reason is not that the twin domain ends there - just the\nopposite - it continues on the neighboring crystal face: if the surface of a\npatch belonging to a certain twin domain corresponds to a z-face, the\ncontinuation of that patch must correspond to an r-face on an adjacent crystal\nface, and as a consequence one surface is etched, the other one not. To show\nthe geometry of the twin domains more clearly, the patches have been colored\nblue and golden in the image to the right.\n\nTo my knowledge, this etching is natural, and I have not enhanced the contrast\nof the image in any way. To see such a strong pattern, one normally needs to\netch the crystal with hydrofluoric acid, but the hot fluids in a pegmatite or\nmiarole pocket like the one the crystal probably came from are also very\naggressive agents.\n\n20mm 800x1000 97kb - 1600x2000 324kb  \n---  \n  \nOn this smoky quartz crystal from Morocco one can see two x-faces, one at the\nupper right corner of the left m-face, another at the upper right corner of\nthe central m-face, so the crystal must be a Dauphin\u00e9 Law twin. This can also\nbe concluded from the etching pattern on the rhombohedral faces which is\nclearly visible on the upper left face: the patches have irregular boundaries\nthat are typical for penetration twins like Dauphin\u00e9 Law twins, and not\nstraight ones as in contact twins like Brazil Law twins.\n\nSince the x-faces are on the right side of the prism faces, this is a\nright/right twin.\n\nIn addition to the x-faces, there are also two types of steep rhombohedral\nfaces that sit in between the prism and the (normal) rhombohedral faces.\n\n5mm 855x1006 108kb - 1710x2012 344kb  \n---  \n  \nThis rock crystal from Arkansas has 2 adjacent diamond-shaped s-faces, so it\nmust be twinned. We are lucky: the s-faces are slightly striated, well visible\non the left one. If the s-face shows a striation, it is always oriented\nparallel to the borders of the r-face, so the rhombohedral face in the center\nwould be a z-face. However, the right s-face's stripes are oriented in the\nsame direction (not visible on the image), which would make the central face\nan r-face - and that can't be, except the crystal is a right/right or Dauphin\u00e9\nLaw twin.\n\n### Brazil Law Twins\n\nH.264-movie, 256x256px: brazil_twin_1.mp4 376kb  \n---  \n  \nIn a Brazil Law twin right and a left hand quartz structures are combined in a\nsingle crystal. Although Brazil Law twinning is very common in quartz\ncrystals, morphological Brazil Law twins in which the twinning is reflected in\nthe position of crystal faces are extremely rare. I don't own one and have\nnever seen one in nature or in a museum, and there is not even a picture of\none in Rykart's quartz monograph. To show you an image, I can only direct you\nto two other websites: 1.) www.faden.it presents images of Brazil Law twins\n2.) on the website of Uniun Cristallina a very good image of a Brazil Law twin\ncan be found.\n\nThe tiny interlocked quartz grains that make up cryptocrystalline quartz\nvarieties are mostly heavily twinned polysynthetically according to the Brazil\nLaw on a microscopic scale.\n\nBrazil Law twins can be viewed as contact twins, because the twinning\nboundaries of the subindividuals run parallel to the composition planes, which\nlie perpendicular to the 3 a-axes. But since the twin domains are intergrown\nand hidden in a single crystal that often looks indistinguishable from an\nuntwinned crystal, Brazil Law twins are also penetration twins. In a cross-\nsection of a crystal the twin domains of a Brazil Law twin form a\ncharacteristic pattern made of straight lines and triangles, as shown\nschematically in the figure to the right. This pattern can be made visible\neither by etching a cross section or with the aid of polarized light. As in\nBrazil Law twins, the size and shape of the twin domains can vary and the\nshares of left- and right-handed parts in a crystal don't have to be equal.\n\nBrazil Law twins are optical twins: Light waves that pass through a right or\nleft quartz along its c axis change the orientation of their oscillation plane\nin either left or right direction. The effects of the right and left parts of\nthe twinned crystal will at least partially cancel out each other, and if the\nleft and right quartz portions are equal, the light will pass apparently\nunaltered. In a slice of a twinned crystal the left- and right-handed portions\ncan still be made visible in polarized light, of course.\n\nMany amethysts are twinned polysynthetically according to the Brazil Law:\nLarge parts of the amethyst crystals are composed of alternating layers of\nleft- and right-handed quartz. The gauge of individual layers is normally less\nthan 1 mm. This peculiar pattern develops primarily in sectors under the\npositive rhombohedral faces r which are usually larger, while the parts under\nthe z faces remain untwinned. The fingerprint-like pattern can sometimes be\ndirectly observed on rhombohedral faces of amethysts, in particular in\nspecimen from Uruguay, but most of the times it can only be made visible by\netching cross sections of crystals.\n\n20mm 800x960 52kb - 1600x1920 162kb  \n---  \n  \nBrazil Law twins can usually only be visually identified by growth and etching\npatterns on crystal faces. This rock crystal shows typical triangular Brazil\nLaw twinning domains at the central and lower parts of its prism faces, that\nare more shiny and more transparent than the rest of the prism face. The\ncrystal is from Joaquim Fel\u00edcio, Minas Gerais, Brazil.\n\n10mm 720x800 101kb - 1440x1600 329kb  \n---  \n  \nA detail view of the Brazil Law twin domains of the same crystal from Joaquim\nFel\u00edcio. Under a different illumination the twin domains stand out as shiny\nroughly triangular patches. This more regular pattern is very different from\nthe irregular patches seen on Dauphin\u00e9 Law twins.\n\n### Japan Law Twins\n\nThe Japan Law is the only common twinning law of quartz where the two twin\ncrystals are visible as individuals. In a Japan Law twin the c-axis of two\ncrystals meet at an angle of 84\u00b033', with two of the m prism faces of both\ncrystals being parallel. The result is usually a V-shaped twin, rarely a\nslightly oblique cross. Very often the Japan Law twin looks platy, because the\ncrystal grows faster between the two arms.\n\nJapan Law twin quartzes have initially been labeled as La Gardette twins,\nafter the first locality in the French Alps where this type of twinning has\nbeen described before the large number of localities in Japan were discovered.\nJapanese twins are quite rare and a newly discovered locality will always be\nmentioned in collector's magazines.\n\nLike Brazil twins, Japan Law twins are contact twins. The twinning plane is {\n1 1 2 2 }, corresponding to the form \u03be (the Greek letter xi), a negative\ntrigonal bipyramid, similar to the positive trigonal bipyramid and its s-face,\nbut flatter. The form \u03be is a very rare crystal face that lies between the r\nand z face. Interestingly, Japan Law twins can additionally be Brazil as well\nas Dauphin\u00e9 Law twins.\n\n20mm 1390x930 120kb - 2780x1860 366kb  \n---  \n  \nVery often Japan Law twins grew in between needle quartz, like this specimen\nfrom the Mondo Nuevo Mine, Conchucos, La Libertad, Peru. This makes for a\nstark contrast as the Japan Law twins are much larger and flattened.\n\n10mm 960x925 116kb - 1920x1850 389kb  \n---  \n  \nJapan Law twins tend to be platy, and can have an almost square shape or one\nthat resembles a heart, like this one from Andilamena, Madagascar.\n\n5mm 1360x1152 270kb - 2720x2304 742kb  \n---  \n  \nA Japan Law twin amethyst from Lac Alaotra, Madagascar. This one has amethyst\ncoloration well inside the Japanese twin, but phantom-like around a colorless\ncore, Japan Law twins with amethyst-colored scepters on their tips seem to be\na bit more common. Like many other amethyst, the specimen carries inclusions\nof iron oxides and hydroxides, small black spheres of either hematite or\ngoethite as a phantom in the core and needle-like goethite inclusions in the\nouter parts.\n\nca.20mm 864x800 107kb - 1728x1600 323kb  \n---  \n  \nA very nice smoky Japan Law twin from the Ortiz Mountains, Ortiz Land Grant,\nSanta Fe Country, New Mexico. Smoky quartz Japan Law twins are quite unusual,\nand this one even shows a nice zonar color distribution that indicates how the\ntwin started with a stubby, almost quadrangular shape. The photo was taken at\nthe Mineral Museum at Socorro in New Mexico, a state renown for its numerous\nJapan Law twin locations.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1 Some say that there is no \"pseudosymmetry\" and accordingly call the habit of\nsuch twins hexagonal. I disagree: natural crystals - twinned or untwinned -\nnever show symmetry as a whole. Their shape obeys certain mathematical\nrelations, so they all share certain geometrical properties, but only\nidealized crystals are symmetric. When one calls a mineral \"isometric\", for\nexample, she does not mean to say that the mineral in all its occurrences is\nisometric, but that the structural elements that determine the external shape\nof the crystals show isometric symmetry. In that sense, a crystal is said to\nhave pseudohexagonal habit when its external shape suggests the presence of an\ninternal hexagonal structure, while, in fact, the crystal lattice possesses a\ndifferent symmetry.\n\nPrinter Friendly Version\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2005-2016, A.C.
