The computation and task\ndistributing could also help existing PICs to extend their computing capacity\nfor more advanced tasks,\u201d Dai said in the paper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTaichi experimentally achieved on-chip 1,000-category\u2013level classification\n(testing at 91.89 per cent accuracy in the 1623-category Omniglot dataset) and\nhigh-fidelity artificial intelligence\u2013generated content with up to two orders\nof magnitude of improvement in efficiency.\u201d\n\nIn October last year, the team launched an optical chip that broke through\nproblems such as computing unit integration and optoelectronic interfaces.\n\nThe researchers said the work on Taichi underscored the chip\u2019s potential in\nprocessing large-scale high-resolution images and training billion-parameter\nmodels, paving the way for applications in low-power automated systems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe anticipate that Taichi will accelerate the development of more powerful\noptical solutions as critical support for the foundation model and a new era\nof AGI,\u201d the team said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nListen\n\n10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe use cookies to tailor your experience and present relevant ads.
