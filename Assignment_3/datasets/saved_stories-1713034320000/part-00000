The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) could not\ncollect against his overseas landlord, so the Canadian tenant was on the hook.\n\nLast year, the tenant took the Minister of National Revenue to court, arguing\nthat he did not know his landlord was a non-resident. The tenant, whose Italy-\nbased landlord owned a single unit in a Montreal building, lost the Tax Court\nappeal on the grounds that they were a Canadian resident paying rent to a non-\nresident landlord, and were therefore required to withhold and remit 25 per\ncent of the rent to the CRA. The judge acknowledged \u201cthe harsh consequences,\u201d\nin her decision, but still held the \u201cresident payer,\u201d or renter, liable.\n\nThe problem with the law is that residential rent is treated the same as a\nroyalties or similar payments, said Montreal-based tax lawyer Eric Luu, who\ndefended the tenant in the case. In other words, residential tenants are held\nto the same standard as \u201ca sophisticated business,\u201d he said.\n\nNot knowing a landlord is a non-resident is not considered a valid excuse.\n\n\u201cIt is concerning,\u201d said Mr. Luu. \u201cBut it\u2019s very hard to go after the non-\nresident, so they put the burden on the tenant. If you take a step back, set\naside the way the Income Tax Act is drafted, and just look at the policy of\nit, in these situations, you have to ask yourself who has the leverage?\nObviously, the tenant does not have the leverage.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Finance could come up with ways to ensure that non-resident\nlandlords pay their taxes without defaulting to putting the burden on\ntenants,\u201d said Mr. Luu.\n\nMore coverage:\n\nA \u2018weird\u2019 March shows real estate market still off balance\n\nLiberal plan to build 3.87 million homes by 2031 includes new pledge to stem\nreal estate fraud\n\nAlex Bozikovic: A denser city? In Toronto\u2019s Annex, neighbours say no\n\nIt\u2019s well known that non-resident owners have long had to pay withholding\ntaxes on properties they either sell or rent out. However, few renters and few\nin the real estate business are aware that if those taxes don\u2019t get paid, the\ntenant could be on the hook, said long-time realtor Lorne Goldman. Mr. Goldman\nsells properties to non-residents, and said realtors \u2013 and all renters and all\nsmall mom-and-pop landlords \u2013 should be formally educated on the risks to\ntenants.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the real estate business, and I don\u2019t even know about it,\u201d said Mr.\nGoldman. \u201cIn my opinion, 99.99 per cent of all tenants in Canada are unaware\nof this, and it is the responsibility of the CRA to inform the renting public\nthat they could be on the hook for this withholding tax.\u201d\n\nIn B.C., where one in 10 new condos are owned by a non-resident, what are the\nchances that some of those non-resident landlords are not filing their\nwithholding taxes?, he asked.\n\nNon-resident landlord Chris Oliver, who owns three rental units in Vancouver\nand lives in Hong Kong, said he didn\u2019t know about the withholding tax, but his\nproperty manager has it covered. Licensed property managers are responsible\nfor collecting the taxes, which takes the burden off the tenant, assuming they\npay through a property manager.\n\n\u201cIt sounds unfair for the tenants to be expected to handle this accounting\nrule,\u201d said Mr. Oliver. \u201cCan you imagine all the stress they are facing with\nhaving to hustle to pay their rents and the rising cost of living, and then to\ndiscover that there\u2019s a whole complicated payments rule they are expected to\nmanage?\u201d\n\nRon Usher, long-time lawyer and general counsel for The Society of Notaries\nPublic and visiting professor at Simon Fraser University, said he was taken\naback by the Quebec case when he learned about it last year. He wonders how\nmany non-resident landlords are not paying the tax.\n\n\u201cHow many tens of thousands of situations are there where this isn\u2019t being\ndone? The exposure to tenants is enormous. ... I think the story at this point\nis that it\u2019s weird, it\u2019s amazing, and it appears to be the law.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cit\u2019s breathtakingly difficult\u201d to figure out if someone is a\nresident or non-resident.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about tax residency, not physical residency. They could be in\nSan Diego, but they really are a tax resident, so there\u2019s this complication.\u201d\n\nLawyer Michael Drouillard is vice chair of Landlord BC and specialist in\ntenancy law. Mr. Drouillard said he knew about the potential for tenant\nliability long ago when he was a property manager, but he was still surprised\nto see a tenant held liable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised to see that they actually did this in the context of a\nresidential tenancy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s very nice for CRA to pursue a residential tenant who\nhas no idea. You\u2019re not told at any time that you have this lingering\nliability, and [are held to] this high degree of diligence.\n\n\u201cHow can you expect that of a residential tenant?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey have enough\nthings to figure out. They don\u2019t need some potential massive tax liability\nthat they weren\u2019t even aware of.\u201d\n\nThe government considers a person a non-resident if they reside in Canada less\nthan 183 days out of the year, or does not \u201cordinarily\u201d reside in Canada.\nGenerally, non-residents are subject to tax on income earned in Canada,\nincluding rental income. On the government of Canada website, it states: \u201cTo\nmake sure the correct amount is deducted, it\u2019s important to tell Canadian\npayers [such as renters] that you\u2019re a non-resident for income tax purposes.\u201d\n\nTenant Mariana Makulkina, who found her apartment on Facebook Marketplace,\nsays she only learned that her landlord lived overseas when she did her own\nresearch. She has a property manager, but without that third-party protection,\nshe wouldn\u2019t have known to ask her landlord when she signed the lease. Also,\nwhat landlord wants to be asked if they are paying taxes in Canada?\n\n\u201cIt was never brought to my attention, and I could almost guarantee that\nnobody would know about that,\u201d said Ms. Makulkina.\n\nProperty manager Donald Mackenzie, of Bodewell Rental Property Management,\nsaid his company routinely files remittances for their non-resident landlords,\nwhich make up about 10 to 15 per cent of his clients. However, he has had the\noccasional non-resident say that they did not want to pay the tax.\n\n\u201cAnd then I say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to work with you.\u2019 It\u2019s that simple. But most\nowners will say, \u2018make sure we are compliant.\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, Mr. Drouillard wonders why there isn\u2019t more upfront clarity for\ntenants, who are often desperate to find an affordable apartment and who might\nnot have a clue that their landlord is living outside Canada.\n\nTo protect themselves, tenants could start asking for statutory declarations\nfrom their landlords, attesting to their tax residency status, said Mr.\nDrouillard. But the landlord could move out of the country and their status\nchanges, and the tenant doesn\u2019t know.\n\nB.C.\u2019s residential tenancy agreement forms do not ask landlords to provide\nproof of their residency status. But when a homeowner sells a property, they\nmust state their tax residency. That\u2019s intended to protect the buyer from\nliability in case there are outstanding taxes owed. Tenants should have that\nsame protection.\n\n\u201cIn the context of a housing crisis, making them also investigate the\nresidency status of their landlords?,\u201d said Mr. Drouillard. \u201cI\u2019m not saying\nthat that\u2019s not the law, and the tenant has to be careful of that. The\nquestion is, is this the right thing for the CRA as a matter of policy to be\ndoing?\u201d\n\nThe CRA did not respond to requests to comment.\n\n## Sign up for the Real Estate Newsletter.\n\nYour house is your most valuable asset.
