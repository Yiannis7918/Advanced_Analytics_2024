Yet, the community is\n> only slowly adopting these models for text embedding tasks, which require\n> rich contextualized representations. In this work, we introduce LLM2Vec, a\n> simple unsupervised approach that can transform any decoder-only LLM into a\n> strong text encoder. LLM2Vec consists of three simple steps: 1) enabling\n> bidirectional attention, 2) masked next token prediction, and 3)\n> unsupervised contrastive learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\n> LLM2Vec by applying it to 3 popular LLMs ranging from 1.3B to 7B parameters\n> and evaluate the transformed models on English word- and sequence-level\n> tasks. We outperform encoder-only models by a large margin on word-level\n> tasks and reach a new unsupervised state-of-the-art performance on the\n> Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB). Moreover, when combining LLM2Vec\n> with supervised contrastive learning, we achieve state-of-the-art\n> performance on MTEB among models that train only on publicly available data.\n> Our strong empirical results and extensive analysis demonstrate that LLMs\n> can be effectively transformed into universal text encoders in a parameter-\n> efficient manner without the need for expensive adaptation or synthetic\n> GPT-4 generated data.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.05961 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.05961v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Parishad BehnamGhader [view email] [v1] Tue, 9 Apr 2024 02:51:05 UTC\n(3,854 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled LLM2Vec: Large Language Models Are Secretly\nPowerful Text Encoders, by Parishad BehnamGhader and 5 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
