So why is America\u2019s paradigmatic\ncontainer brand failing?\n\nBy Amanda Mull\n\nAlamy\n\nApril 12, 2024, 7 AM ET\n\nFor the first several decades of my life, most of the meals I ate involved at\nleast one piece of Tupperware. My mom\u2019s pieces were mostly the greens and\nyellows of a 1970s kitchen, purchased from co-workers or neighbors who\ncirculated catalogs around the office or slipped them into mailboxes in our\nsuburban subdivision. Many of her containers were acquired before my brother\nand I were born and remained in regular use well after I flew the nest for\ncollege in the mid-2000s. To this day, the birthday cake that my mom makes for\nmy visits gets stored on her kitchen counter in a classic Tupperware cake\nsaver\u2014a flat gold base with a tall, milky-white lid made of semi-rigid\nplastic. Somewhere deep in her cabinets, the matching gold carrying strap is\nprobably still hiding, in case a cake is on the go.\n\nIf you\u2019re over 30 and were raised in the American suburbs, you can probably\ntell a similar story, though your mom\u2019s color choices might have been a little\ndifferent. As more and more middle-class women joined the workforce, new\nproducts that promised convenience in domestic work, which largely still fell\nto them, became indispensable tools of the homemaking trade. Reusable food-\nstorage containers kept leftovers fresher for longer, made packing lunches\neasier, and, when combined with the ascendantly popular microwave, sped the\nprocess of getting last night\u2019s dinner back onto the table. Tupperware became\nsuch a dominant domestic force that its brand name, like Band-Aid and Kleenex,\nis often still used as a stand-in for plastic food-storage containers of any\ntype or brand.\n\nIn theory, Tupperware should be even more popular now than it was decades ago.\nThe market for storage containers, on the whole, is thriving. Practices such\nas meal-prepping and buying in bulk have further centered reusable food\ncontainers in America\u2019s eating habits. Obsessive kitchen organization is among\nsocial media\u2019s favorite pastimes, and plastic storage containers in every\nconceivable size and shape play an outsize role in the super-popular videos\ndepicting spotless, abundant refrigerators and pantries on TikTok, Instagram,\nand YouTube. But Tupperware has fallen on hard times. At the end of last\nmonth, for a second year in a row, the company warned financial regulators\nthat it would be unable to file its annual report on time and raised doubts\nabout its ability to continue as a business, citing a \u201cchallenging financial\ncondition.\u201d Sales are in decline. These should be boom times for Tupperware.\nWhat happened?\n\nRead: Home influencers will not rest until everything has been put in a clear\nplastic storage bin\n\nThe Tupperware origin story is a near-perfect fable of 20th-century American\ningenuity. Earl Tupper, the product\u2019s namesake, was a serial inventor who used\nmid-century advances in plastics technology to develop the first range of\nairtight food containers affordable for middle-class households. Tupperware\ndebuted in 1946, but it didn\u2019t really take off until a few years later, when\nBrownie Wise, a divorced mom from Michigan, began selling the stuff to friends\nand neighbors she invited to her home. Her success caught the attention of\nTupperware, and then of women across America who had gotten a taste of the\nworking life during World War II but had been displaced from their wartime\njobs by men returning from military service. Many of them began selling the\nfood containers to their friends and neighbors in the living-room showcases\nthat became Tupperware parties.\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n  * ### The Long Lines for Women\u2019s Bathrooms Could Be Eliminated.

Modestly sized lidded bowls\nwere joined by dry-goods canisters, pie keepers, pitchers, and measuring cups.\nA kitchen full of Tupperware products became a symbol of social and domestic\nsuccess: Practical but a little pricey, the storage containers were trafficked\nthrough women\u2019s community bonds, and owning them telegraphed a commitment to\norder, cleanliness, and sensible stewardship of the family\u2019s time and food\nbudget. Particularly stylish moms matched their Tupperware collections to\ntheir kitchen decor.\n\nTupperware did not respond to an interview request on the company\u2019s current\nwoes, but the problems it faces are not difficult to see. The first is that,\nin a lot of ways, its products are still those products. Much of Tupperware\u2019s\nrange still looks at least a little bit like it did decades ago\u2014textured,\npliant plastic that obscures what\u2019s inside. Some of these products are a clear\nnostalgia play to tempt younger shoppers with the retro, rainbow-colored bowls\nand tubs their mom used, but many of the products just look dingy, clunky,\nold. And nostalgia is not necessarily something buyers want in plastic\nkitchenware. Since Tupperware\u2019s heyday, what we know about the safety of\nplastics that were commonly used in food storage has changed, and the public\u2019s\nbuying preferences along with it. Like most older plastic containers,\nTupperware made before 2010 contains a type of chemical called BPA, which is\nassociated with a host of health problems including infertility, fetal\nabnormalities, and heart disease. Tupperware has since removed BPA from its\nproducts, but on a visual level, many of them still appear to be the bowls you\nmight now wish your mom hadn\u2019t microwaved so frequently when you were a kid.\n\nTupperware\u2019s competitors have multiplied in recent decades, and most of them\nhave been more adept at signaling newness and cleanliness to customers. OXO,\nPyrex, and Rubbermaid, for example, all sell popular lines of containers that\nuse crystal-clear hard plastic or glass and have mechanical latches or seals\nto prevent spills and keep food airtight. They look neat and orderly\u2014even\nexpensive\u2014in the bright, cool-toned LED lighting of modern refrigerators. At\n$50 to $80 for a modestly sized set, they actually tend to cost less than\ntheir Tupperware equivalents, which can top $90 for a set of basic plastic\nbowls. For buyers more concerned about price than beauty, Ziploc and Glad make\nsets of cheap, thin plastic containers that can be bought for $10 or $12 at\nmost grocery stores.\n\nWhere exactly one buys Tupperware has also become an issue over time. The bulk\nof the company\u2019s dwindling sales volume still comes from women selling to\ntheir social circles, which is now more of a liability in the United States\nthan it was a generation or two ago. This type of \u201cdirect sales\u201d model has\nproliferated widely in the social-media era, with distant Facebook friends\npestering people to buy things like essential oils and cheap leggings. It has\nprompted a significant backlash, creating a consumer base that\u2019s tired of\nsales pitches from acquaintances and suspicious of products sold in that\nformat. Tupperware parties still work for the brand in some parts of the\nworld, but for mainly the same reason that they worked in mid-century America:\nIn 2013, Indonesia became Tupperware\u2019s biggest market, thanks in large part to\na growing population of workforce-curious women who embraced the opportunity\nto make some extra cash for their family by doing business with other women in\ntight-knit social communities. Sales in North America have continued to\ndecline, and they now make up only a little over a quarter of the company\u2019s\ntotal volume, according to its most recent annual report.\n\nInstead of changing with the times, Tupperware has clung to its old ways for\ndecades longer than it probably should have. The company brought in a new CEO\nlate last year, and she has said she will modernize both the products and the\ncompany\u2019s sales structure. But those efforts now seem likely to be too little,\ntoo late. Other than a brief dalliance with what were then called SuperTarget\nstores in the early 2000s, the brand didn\u2019t make a serious push into\ntraditional retailing until 2022, and its products are now stocked alongside\nmore modern-looking and frequently less expensive competitors at Target and\nMacy\u2019s. You can also now buy Tupperware online directly from the brand, but\nwhen you arrive at its website, a bright-orange banner across the top alerts\nyou that you\u2019re not shopping with a representative, in case you should want to\nremedy that and give a co-worker or neighbor the credit for whatever you buy.\n\nNone of these issues takes a keen retail or product-development mind to\ndetect. Tupperware\u2019s woes don\u2019t seem to be the result of unpredictable market\nchanges or fickle consumers. Instead, like many once-prosperous 20th-century\nAmerican companies, Tupperware\u2019s downfall appears to land squarely at the feet\nof its management. As far back as the 1980s, according to The Wall Street\nJournal, it was clear to executives at Kraft, then the company\u2019s owner, that\nhigh workforce participation among American women was making the direct-sales\nmodel less viable; if women had full-time jobs, they mostly didn\u2019t need side\nhustles or want to go to buying parties, even if they still wanted storage\ncontainers and kitchen gadgets. At the same time, Tupperware\u2019s patents began\nto expire, which created new competition for a brand that had long had very\nlittle. At that time, the company still had decades of goodwill in front of\nit, and it had a direct line to an army of women who could have helped guide\nthe company\u2019s development of newer, better products that people would have\nbeen excited to continue stocking their kitchens with. Instead, those products\nare now made by its competitors and available virtually anywhere that food or\nhome goods are sold. Tupperware, meanwhile, is still waiting for the return of\na glorious past that is never coming back.\n\nAmanda Mull is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
