(July 2018) (Learn how and when to remove\nthis template message)  \n---  \nA 2D slice of a 6D Calabi\u2013Yau quintic manifold.\n\nIn algebraic and differential geometry, a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold, also known as a\nCalabi\u2013Yau space, is a particular type of manifold which has properties, such\nas Ricci flatness, yielding applications in theoretical physics. Particularly\nin superstring theory, the extra dimensions of spacetime are sometimes\nconjectured to take the form of a 6-dimensional Calabi\u2013Yau manifold, which led\nto the idea of mirror symmetry. Their name was coined by Candelas et al.\n(1985), after Eugenio Calabi (1954, 1957) who first conjectured that such\nsurfaces might exist, and Shing-Tung Yau (1978) who proved the Calabi\nconjecture.\n\nCalabi\u2013Yau manifolds are complex manifolds that are generalizations of K3\nsurfaces in any number of complex dimensions (i.e. any even number of real\ndimensions). They were originally defined as compact K\u00e4hler manifolds with a\nvanishing first Chern class and a Ricci-flat metric, though many other similar\nbut inequivalent definitions are sometimes used.\n\n## Definitions[edit]\n\nThe motivational definition given by Shing-Tung Yau is of a compact K\u00e4hler\nmanifold with a vanishing first Chern class, that is also Ricci flat.^[1]\n\nThere are many other definitions of a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold used by different\nauthors, some inequivalent. This section summarizes some of the more common\ndefinitions and the relations between them.\n\nA Calabi\u2013Yau -fold or Calabi\u2013Yau manifold of (complex) dimension is sometimes\ndefined as a compact -dimensional K\u00e4hler manifold satisfying one of the\nfollowing equivalent conditions:\n\n  * The canonical bundle of is trivial.\n  * has a holomorphic -form that vanishes nowhere.\n  * The structure group of the tangent bundle of can be reduced from , the unitary group, to , the special unitary group.\n  * has a K\u00e4hler metric with global holonomy contained in .\n\nThese conditions imply that the first integral Chern class of vanishes.\nNevertheless, the converse is not true. The simplest examples where this\nhappens are hyperelliptic surfaces, finite quotients of a complex torus of\ncomplex dimension 2, which have vanishing first integral Chern class but non-\ntrivial canonical bundle.\n\nFor a compact -dimensional K\u00e4hler manifold the following conditions are\nequivalent to each other, but are weaker than the conditions above, though\nthey are sometimes used as the definition of a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold:\n\n  * has vanishing first real Chern class.\n  * has a K\u00e4hler metric with vanishing Ricci curvature.\n  * has a K\u00e4hler metric with local holonomy contained in .\n  * A positive power of the canonical bundle of is trivial.\n  * has a finite cover that has trivial canonical bundle.\n  * has a finite cover that is a product of a torus and a simply connected manifold with trivial canonical bundle.\n\nIf a compact K\u00e4hler manifold is simply connected, then the weak definition\nabove is equivalent to the stronger definition. Enriques surfaces give\nexamples of complex manifolds that have Ricci-flat metrics, but their\ncanonical bundles are not trivial, so they are Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds according\nto the second but not the first definition above. On the other hand, their\ndouble covers are Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds for both definitions (in fact, K3\nsurfaces).\n\nBy far the hardest part of proving the equivalences between the various\nproperties above is proving the existence of Ricci-flat metrics. This follows\nfrom Yau's proof of the Calabi conjecture, which implies that a compact K\u00e4hler\nmanifold with a vanishing first real Chern class has a K\u00e4hler metric in the\nsame class with vanishing Ricci curvature. (The class of a K\u00e4hler metric is\nthe cohomology class of its associated 2-form.) Calabi showed such a metric is\nunique.\n\nThere are many other inequivalent definitions of Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds that are\nsometimes used, which differ in the following ways (among others):\n\n  * The first Chern class may vanish as an integral class or as a real class.\n  * Most definitions assert that Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds are compact, but some allow them to be non-compact. In the generalization to non-compact manifolds, the difference must vanish asymptotically. Here, is the K\u00e4hler form associated with the K\u00e4hler metric, .^[2]\n  * Some definitions put restrictions on the fundamental group of a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold, such as demanding that it be finite or trivial. Any Calabi\u2013Yau manifold has a finite cover that is the product of a torus and a simply-connected Calabi\u2013Yau manifold.\n  * Some definitions require that the holonomy be exactly equal to rather than a subgroup of it, which implies that the Hodge numbers vanish for . Abelian surfaces have a Ricci flat metric with holonomy strictly smaller than (in fact trivial) so are not Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds according to such definitions.\n  * Most definitions assume that a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold has a Riemannian metric, but some treat them as complex manifolds without a metric.\n  * Most definitions assume the manifold is non-singular, but some allow mild singularities. While the Chern class fails to be well-defined for singular Calabi\u2013Yau's, the canonical bundle and canonical class may still be defined if all the singularities are Gorenstein, and so may be used to extend the definition of a smooth Calabi\u2013Yau manifold to a possibly singular Calabi\u2013Yau variety.\n\n## Examples[edit]\n\nThe fundamental fact is that any smooth algebraic variety embedded in a\nprojective space is a K\u00e4hler manifold, because there is a natural Fubini\u2013Study\nmetric on a projective space which one can restrict to the algebraic variety.\nBy definition, if \u03c9 is the K\u00e4hler metric on the algebraic variety X and the\ncanonical bundle K_X is trivial, then X is Calabi\u2013Yau. Moreover, there is\nunique K\u00e4hler metric \u03c9 on X such that [\u03c9_0] = [\u03c9] \u2208 H^2(X,R), a fact which was\nconjectured by Eugenio Calabi and proved by Shing-Tung Yau (see Calabi\nconjecture).\n\n### Calabi\u2013Yau algebraic curves[edit]\n\nIn one complex dimension, the only compact examples are tori, which form a\none-parameter family. The Ricci-flat metric on a torus is actually a flat\nmetric, so that the holonomy is the trivial group SU(1). A one-dimensional\nCalabi\u2013Yau manifold is a complex elliptic curve, and in particular, algebraic.\n\n### CY algebraic surfaces[edit]\n\nIn two complex dimensions, the K3 surfaces furnish the only compact simply\nconnected Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds. These can be constructed as quartic surfaces\nin , such as the complex algebraic variety defined by the vanishing locus of\n\n> for\n\nOther examples can be constructed as elliptic fibrations,^[3] as quotients of\nabelian surfaces,^[4] or as complete intersections.\n\nNon simply-connected examples are given by abelian surfaces, which are real\nfour tori equipped with a complex manifold structure. Enriques surfaces and\nhyperelliptic surfaces have first Chern class that vanishes as an element of\nthe real cohomology group, but not as an element of the integral cohomology\ngroup, so Yau's theorem about the existence of a Ricci-flat metric still\napplies to them but they are sometimes not considered to be Calabi\u2013Yau\nmanifolds. Abelian surfaces are sometimes excluded from the classification of\nbeing Calabi\u2013Yau, as their holonomy (again the trivial group) is a proper\nsubgroup of SU(2), instead of being isomorphic to SU(2). However, the Enriques\nsurface subset do not conform entirely to the SU(2) subgroup in the String\ntheory landscape.\n\n### CY threefolds[edit]\n\nIn three complex dimensions, classification of the possible Calabi\u2013Yau\nmanifolds is an open problem, although Yau suspects that there is a finite\nnumber of families (albeit a much bigger number than his estimate from 20\nyears ago). In turn, it has also been conjectured by Miles Reid that the\nnumber of topological types of Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds is infinite, and that they\ncan all be transformed continuously (through certain mild singularizations\nsuch as conifolds) one into another\u2014much as Riemann surfaces can.^[5] One\nexample of a three-dimensional Calabi\u2013Yau manifold is a non-singular quintic\nthreefold in CP^4, which is the algebraic variety consisting of all of the\nzeros of a homogeneous quintic polynomial in the homogeneous coordinates of\nthe CP^4. Another example is a smooth model of the Barth\u2013Nieto quintic. Some\ndiscrete quotients of the quintic by various Z_5 actions are also Calabi\u2013Yau\nand have received a lot of attention in the literature. One of these is\nrelated to the original quintic by mirror symmetry.\n\nFor every positive integer n, the zero set, in the homogeneous coordinates of\nthe complex projective space CP^n+1, of a non-singular homogeneous degree n +\n2 polynomial in n + 2 variables is a compact Calabi\u2013Yau n-fold. The case n = 1\ndescribes an elliptic curve, while for n = 2 one obtains a K3 surface.\n\nMore generally, Calabi\u2013Yau varieties/orbifolds can be found as weighted\ncomplete intersections in a weighted projective space. The main tool for\nfinding such spaces is the adjunction formula.\n\nAll hyper-K\u00e4hler manifolds are Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds.\n\n#### Constructed from algebraic curves[edit]\n\nFor an algebraic curve a quasi-projective Calabi-Yau threefold can be\nconstructed^[6] as the total space where . For the canonical projection we can\nfind the relative tangent bundle is using the relative tangent sequence\n\nand observing the only tangent vectors in the fiber which are not in the pre-\nimage of are canonically associated with the fibers of the vector bundle.\nUsing this, we can use the relative cotangent sequence\n\ntogether with the properties of wedge powers that\n\nand giving the triviality of .\n\n#### Constructed from algebraic surfaces[edit]\n\nUsing a similar argument as for curves, the total space of the canonical sheaf\nfor an algebraic surface forms a Calabi-Yau threefold. A simple example is\nover projective space.\n\n## Applications in superstring theory[edit]\n\nCalabi\u2013Yau manifolds are important in superstring theory. Essentially,\nCalabi\u2013Yau manifolds are shapes that satisfy the requirement of space for the\nsix \"unseen\" spatial dimensions of string theory, which may be smaller than\nour currently observable lengths as they have not yet been detected. A popular\nalternative known as large extra dimensions, which often occurs in braneworld\nmodels, is that the Calabi\u2013Yau is large but we are confined to a small subset\non which it intersects a D-brane. Further extensions into higher dimensions\nare currently being explored with additional ramifications for general\nrelativity.\n\nIn the most conventional superstring models, ten conjectural dimensions in\nstring theory are supposed to come as four of which we are aware, carrying\nsome kind of fibration with fiber dimension six. Compactification on\nCalabi\u2013Yau n-folds are important because they leave some of the original\nsupersymmetry unbroken. More precisely, in the absence of fluxes,\ncompactification on a Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold (real dimension 6) leaves one quarter\nof the original supersymmetry unbroken if the holonomy is the full SU(3).\n\nMore generally, a flux-free compactification on an n-manifold with holonomy\nSU(n) leaves 2^1\u2212n of the original supersymmetry unbroken, corresponding to\n2^6\u2212n supercharges in a compactification of type II supergravity or 2^5\u2212n\nsupercharges in a compactification of type I. When fluxes are included the\nsupersymmetry condition instead implies that the compactification manifold be\na generalized Calabi\u2013Yau, a notion introduced by Hitchin (2003). These models\nare known as flux compactifications.\n\nF-theory compactifications on various Calabi\u2013Yau four-folds provide physicists\nwith a method to find a large number of classical solutions in the so-called\nstring theory landscape.\n\nConnected with each hole in the Calabi\u2013Yau space is a group of low-energy\nstring vibrational patterns. Since string theory states that our familiar\nelementary particles correspond to low-energy string vibrations, the presence\nof multiple holes causes the string patterns to fall into multiple groups, or\nfamilies. Although the following statement has been simplified, it conveys the\nlogic of the argument: if the Calabi\u2013Yau has three holes, then three families\nof vibrational patterns and thus three families of particles will be observed\nexperimentally.\n\nLogically, since strings vibrate through all the dimensions, the shape of the\ncurled-up ones will affect their vibrations and thus the properties of the\nelementary particles observed. For example, Andrew Strominger and Edward\nWitten have shown that the masses of particles depend on the manner of the\nintersection of the various holes in a Calabi\u2013Yau. In other words, the\npositions of the holes relative to one another and to the substance of the\nCalabi\u2013Yau space was found by Strominger and Witten to affect the masses of\nparticles in a certain way. This is true of all particle properties.^[7]\n\n## Calabi-Yau algebra[edit]\n\nA Calabi\u2013Yau algebra was introduced by Victor Ginzburg to transport the\ngeometry of a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold to noncommutative algebraic\ngeometry.^[8]^[9]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Quintic threefold\n  * G2 manifold\n\n## References[edit]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Yau & Nadis (2010).\n  2. ^ Tian & Yau (1991).\n  3. ^ Propp, Oron Y.
