He has generated an astonishing 15\nbillion streams on Spotify, and his invisibility strategy got lots of support\nfrom the platform. These pseudonymous tracks showed up on 144 official\nplaylists with 62 million followers in aggregate.\n\nIn some instances, R\u00f6hr accounts for 40% or more of a single playlist, albeit\nunder a variety of artist names. Sometimes this unassuming musician is known\nas Ralph Kaler, at other times he goes by Sherry Novak or or Jospeh Turley or\nMiu Hayashi or some other identity.\n\nWhen I searched for his music on Spotify, I couldn\u2019t find anything listed\nunder his actual name. R\u00f6hr didn\u2019t even have a Wikipedia entry until a few\ndays ago\u2014and even now it\u2019s just three sentences.\n\nHow can he write music that generates 15 billion streams\u2014I note that the\npopulation of the entire Earth is just 8 billion people\u2014and live in total\nobscurity?\n\nR\u00f6hr\u2019s songs aren\u2019t especially memorable. All the tracks I heard sound like\nbackground music. But that might be the surest pathway to a billion streams in\nthe current moment.\n\nHere\u2019s \u201cAnytime Soon,\u201d recorded under the name Ralph Kaler. I\u2019m sharing the\nYouTube video, which has 65 plays\u2014but the same song has generated 6.5 million\nstreams on Spotify.\n\nThis music does not float my boat. I actually start feeling waterlogged after\nabout twenty seconds. But these banal, anonymous tunes by unknown artists are\nnow permeating the culture.\n\nWhen I search for new music on streaming apps, I keep getting steered to\nplaylists with generic-sounding names (\u201cJazz for Studying,\u201d \u201cClassical Music\nfor Driving,\u201d etc.). The emphasis is on the experience, not the artist.\n\nGo check out the \u201cLofi Girl\u201d channel on YouTube and get a taste of this new\nflavor of anonymity. Here you can watch a video of an anime girl studying\nwhile soothing chillout tracks play in the background.\n\nThis is how an unknown musician attracts ten million plus subscribers in a\nstagnant musical culture. And the key step is...staying unknown.\n\nIs this sonic treacle much different from the Muzak of an earlier day? The\nbiggest change is that Muzak was mercilessly mocked by serious fans as\n\u201celevator music.\u201d Not anymore\u2014bland, generic music has left the elevators\nbehind, instead going mainstream.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised to see the artists who generated a million dollars on\nSpotify last year,\u201d the platform bragged in its annual Music Economics Report.\n\u201cMany aren\u2019t household names and didn\u2019t need a \u2018hit\u2019 song to have a big year.\u201d\n\nThe numbers back up that claim. More than a thousand musicians generated a\nmillion dollars in royalties from Spotify last year without having a single\ntrack reach the platform\u2019s global top 50.\n\n> ### \u201cAndy Warhol once promised everybody 15 minutes of fame, but on TikTok\n> that often gets reduced to 15 seconds of attention.\u201d\n\nYou could hardly imagine a starker contrast with the past. Sixty years ago,\nthousands of excited fans greeted the Beatles on their arrival in New York\u2014at\nthe same moment their hit single sat atop of the Billboard chart. \u201cI Want to\nHold Your Hand\u201d went on to sell ten million copies. That\u2019s tiny compared to\nJohan R\u00f6hr\u2019s 15 billion streams\u2014but enough to make four lads from Liverpool\nfamous and change the direction of American popular music.\n\nMusic economics have gone topsy-turvy since then. And the nature of stardom\nhas changed as a result. Until recently, I thought The Masked Singer was just\na goofy reality show concept, but I\u2019m now convinced it\u2019s an actual formula for\nsuccess. Blessed are the hidden musicians, because they are inheriting the\nplaylists.\n\nSia performing while hidden from view (Scott Murry/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nOne thing is certain. No musician will sell ten million records this year. In\n2024, music is streamed, and rarely purchased. A musician can get rich without\nselling any physical recordings or paid music downloads. Billboard didn\u2019t\nstart counting streaming numbers in its rankings until 2007, but now these\nmetrics drive the charts.\n\nThis shift to streaming comes at a heavy price for new artists. For the first\ntime since the medieval era, musicians can attract a large audience while\nstaying unknown\u2014and they don\u2019t even need to adopt pseudonyms like Johan R\u00f6hr\nto make it happen.\n\nI\u2019m increasingly encountering listeners who praise a track on the radio or a\nplaylist\u2014\u201cI love that song\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s one of my favorites,\u201d a fan will\ndeclare\u2014but if I ask for the name of the tune or the artist, they don\u2019t have a\nclue.\n\nThis explains why so many new artists still struggle for visibility after they\nrelease a hit. Consider the case of Thomas Hewitt-Jones, who composed a song\nthat generated eight billion streams on TikTok. Those are massive numbers,\nmuch larger than the Beatles\u2019 10 million copies of \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand.\u201d\n\nBut this piece, aptly entitled \u201cFunny Song,\u201d didn\u2019t build a reliable audience.\n\u201cI have to be honest and say that in the wake of \u2018Funny Song\u2019, I wrote two\nmore albums of the stuff\u2014none of which have flown in the same way yet,\u201d the\ncomposer told an interviewer.\n\nIt's always tough staying at the top. But it gets a lot tougher when listeners\nnever learned your name in the first place. In 2024, that\u2019s a common\nphenomenon. Andy Warhol once promised everybody 15 minutes of fame, but on\nTikTok that often gets reduced to 15 seconds of attention. Then the listener\nscrolls on to something else.\n\nStreaming platforms have many reasons to prefer unknown musicians like Johan\nR\u00f6hr. In a world of anonymous tracks, superstars and record labels have little\nnegotiating leverage with streamers\u2014whose brand gets stronger as musicians\nlose visibility. In some instances, streaming platforms may even buy these\ntracks as works-for-hire, and thus avoid all royalty payments.\n\nIt\u2019s not just musicians who get downgraded in this scenario, but also the\nsongs. I increasingly hear industry leaders refer to music as content\u2014an\nalarming term that implies every track is generic and interchangeable. Not\nlong ago, only Silicon Valley viewed music in this degrading way, but now even\nthe people working in the heart of the record business adopt the same\nreductionist jargon.\n\nAs a result, genres are increasingly task-oriented\u2014served up as music for\nsleeping, or reading, or exercising, or cleaning the house. I don\u2019t dismiss\nthe power of songs to enhance these activities. But is this the future we want\nfor our star talents and our music culture? For my part, I\u2019d prefer to see\nthousands of screaming fans waiting at the airport for a hot new band to\narrive.\n\nThe rise of AI will only accelerate this process of anonymity. Not only won\u2019t\naudiences know the name of the person behind the song\u2014there might not be any\nhumans involved. Instead of fighting against this, many music industry leaders\nare excited about the potential for cost savings. Why deal with pesky flesh-\nand-blood musicians when the bots will work for almost free?\n\nIs AI replacement already happening? Spotify user Adam Faze recently heard the\nsame boring 41-second song played over and over on the platform. He eventually\ncompiled a playlist of 49 tracks, and they are almost identical. But the\ncreepy thing is that these tunes all had different names\u2014strange titles such\nas \u201cTrumpet Bumblefig,\u201d \u201cScorch Swine,\u201d \u201cThe Proud Dewdrop Amulet\u201d\u2014that sound\nas if they came from a random word generator. Despite the uncanny similarity\nin the music, they were attributed to different musicians and composers.\n\nIs this just AI sludge used to pad playlists with cheap alternatives to human\nmusic? Until we get full disclosure, we can only speculate. But it\u2019s hard to\nbelieve that these songs are boosted because of their quality.\n\nIn this environment, live events are increasingly the only reliable source of\nenergy and excitement in the music world. Few saw this coming after COVID, but\nthe biggest names in music are now finding their greatest triumphs performing\nonstage, not online.\n\nTaylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour stands out as the most successful music initiative of\nthe 21^st century. But it\u2019s worth noting that she had to bypass streaming-\ndriven business models and go straight to her fans via 152 shows on five\ncontinents. That\u2019s as old school as it gets.\n\nFace-to-face contact on a grueling tour is hard work, but it\u2019s the most\nsurefire way of avoiding the fate of the anonymous streaming star. Yet\nconsider the heavy irony that, in the Age of the Internet, the best path\nforward for musicians seeking fame might be to connect with fans on the road\ninstead of the digital highway.\n\n### Subscribe to The Honest Broker\n\nBy Ted Gioia \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nA trustworthy guide to music, books, arts, media & culture by Ted Gioia\n\n112 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n7 Restacks\n\n112\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Rise of the Anonymous Music Star\n\nwww.honest-broker.com\n\n32\n\nShare\n\n32 Comments\n\nDBIndulging a Second Look2 hrs agoOkay, so, here's the other thing about\nthis:Johan R\u00f6hr is Swedish, as is Spotify, and his success getting onto so\nmany Spotify playlists is largely Spotify generated, not user generated,\nplaylists.
