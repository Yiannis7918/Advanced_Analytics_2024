Officials said they\nbelieved the injections were from a counterfeit product.\n\nBotulism is caused when a toxin attacks the body\u2019s nerves and causes muscle\nweakness in the face, mouth and throat. Symptoms can include blurred vision,\ndrooping eyelids, slurred speech and difficulty swallowing, according to the\nTennessee department of health. A purified form of the toxin that causes the\ncondition is used in Botox and approved by the Food and Drug Administration,\naccording to the Illinois department of public health.\n\n\u201cReceiving these treatments in unlicensed, unapproved settings can put you or\nyour loved ones at serious risk for health problems. Please only seek cosmetic\nservices under the care of licensed professionals trained to do these\nprocedures and who use FDA-approved products,\u201d said Sameer Vohra, director of\nthe Illinois department of public health. \u201cIf you are experiencing any health\nproblems after a recent cosmetic treatment, please contact your healthcare\nprovider immediately for help and assistance.\u201d\n\nTwo people in Illinois were also hospitalized and reported botulism-like\nsymptoms after receiving \u201ceither Botox or a possibly counterfeit version of\nthe product\u201d, the Illinois department of public health said in a statement.\nBoth patients had received injections from a licensed nurse in LaSalle county\nwho administered the procedure outside of her authority, according to the\nagency.\n\nThis article was amended on 12 April 2024 to note that Botox is a purified\nform of the toxin that causes botulism, not of the bacteria that produces the\ntoxin as originally stated.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * US news\n  * Plastic surgery\n  * Tennessee\n  * Illinois\n  * Health\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
