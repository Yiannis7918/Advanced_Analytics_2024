Some of them are big thoughts about the direction\nof the company. Some of them are small concepts about how to make the product\neasier to use. And then others are just fleeting notions that turn out not to\nhave been all that good to begin with.\n\nAs a rule, there are more ideas inside a startup than could possibly be\nexecuted. So one of the hardest jobs for a founder (or product manager or\nanyone else with the power to set priorities) is where to focus that\nattention. When it comes to product, specifically, you\u2019ve got feedback from\ncustomers, internal users, and your own roadmap to wrestle with.\n\n## What do you do with a good idea?\n\n### Try the Variance customer growth platform\n\nJoin some of the world's top software companies that use Variance to power\ndata-driven sales.\n\nGet Started \ud83c\udf89\n\n30-day trial\n\nNo credit card required\n\nOne reasonably simple rubric I\u2019ve put together over the years is this\neffort/investment stack. The idea is that you can take any idea about the\ncompany and try to figure out where it sits and whether it\u2019s possible to test\nthe idea in the higher speed/lower effort layers of the stack before moving it\ndown to actual functionality and eventually strategy.\n\nA simple prioritization framework for product ideas. Ideally, things are\ntested at the top before they move their way down.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is there are two axes. The idea is that the\nhigher you are in the stack the faster things move and the lower the\neffort/investment is. By the time you get to the bottom\u2014strategy\u2014you are\ntalking about low speed/high investment changes to the company and product.\n\nHere are the layers of the stack from low effort/high speed to high effort/low\nspeed:\n\n  * Content/Marketing: the least effort/investment goes to the content/marketing. That\u2019s not to say it doesn\u2019t matter, but writing a blog post about how to use your product in a new way is even easier than writing documentation, updating the UI, changing functionality, or even jumping onto a new strategic direction. (Depending on how you handle things, documentation and content could easily be flipped.)\n  * Documentation: documentation doesn\u2019t need to work through the same process/timeline as product changes. Even a small in-app copy change might not go out until the next deploy, but an update to a startup\u2019s docs can go out right now. What\u2019s more, documentation generally offers more space and visual area to explore (you can use images, videos, etc.).\n  * Product Copy: within the UI there is copy, and that\u2019s even easier to change than UI itself. If there is a feature that people aren\u2019t using, for instance, and there\u2019s an opportunity to make it more clear with copy, that\u2019s a great thing to do before redesigning how it works.\n  * UI: ultimately the UI sits on top of the functionality, so it\u2019s easier to change. A good feature idea that can live at the UI layer will be faster to deploy than one that needs additional functionality.\n  * Functionality: you can think of functionality as the data model, features, and other core components that make the product what it is. I\u2019ve always believed that SaaS companies are defined by the objects they initially design their product around. Salesforce will always fundamentally be about communication with customers because their objects are accounts and contacts while Mixpanel will always be about product managers because its core objects are dashboards and charts.\n  * Strategy: these are the fundamental decisions around what the company does and how it operates, this is obviously the top of the stack and the thing that takes the most work to change.\n\n## Using these layers to make decisions\n\nHere\u2019s a relatively simple example of how we\u2019ve recently used this framework\nto make a decision. This week we are launching some new very cool\nfunctionality that lets you see data change in real-time. We\u2019re excited about\nit and it will open up a lot of new possibilities for our customers. We\u2019ve\nbeen testing it and have found some exciting ways to use it with data from\nHubspot. Someone mentioned that we should show this to customers in the app.\nThat would be great, but it would be a lot of work: showing it to customers\nwould require changes at the UI and maybe even functionality layers. (This is\nwhere product onboarding tools can come in handy, but that\u2019s a story for\nanother blog post.)\n\nSo how can we try this cheaper? To start, we can write a blog post or update\nour documentation to show off this feature. Since we already show use cases in\nour documentation, it makes a lot of sense to live there. From there, as we\nsee how customers use the feature and whether they are excited about the same\nthings we are we can start to nudge them in the direction with some in-app\ncopy changes and eventually even include it in our onboarding flow (which we\nbuilt custom and utilizes existing product functionality but operates entirely\non the UI layer).\n\n## Why execution > strategy\n\nSo why does all this mean execution is more important than strategy? Because\nit\u2019s a cheap way to test your strategy before you go all in. Frank Slootman,\nlegendary tech leader and CEO of Snowflake, explains it like this:\n\n> No strategy is better than its execution. ... You can go very, very far with\n> world-class execution whereas you will go nowhere, no matter how brilliant\n> your strategy is ... so execution really needs to come first because\n> strategy is not something you can navigate if you don't know how to execute.\n> The other thing is when you become a strong executor, strategic questions\n> start to crystallize and sort themselves really quickly\u2014in other words, you\n> will become a better strategist as you become a better executor. Execution\n> is day-in-and-day-out, every moment of the day. Strategy is not something\n> that you can touch and tweak every moment of the day\u2014once you set it, you\n> really have to stick with it. If you're changing your strategy at the drop\n> of a hat, you're already way behind the eight ball.\n\nTwo really important points to pull out of that quote:\n\n  * \u201cWhen you become a strong executor, strategic questions start to crystallize and sort themselves really quickly.\u201d This relates to some of what I wrote about in my Shape of Data post as it relates to tinkering. But fundamentally, the better you\u2019re able to execute, the more quickly strategic questions can be asked and answered.\n  * \u201cStrategy is not something that you can touch and tweak every moment of the day.\u201d This is why it exists at the top of the stack. Making a strategic change is a high effort/investment decision. It will impact the whole company and everything you do. You don\u2019t want to do this often, and when you do you want to be really confident about it.\n\nUltimately the real point isn\u2019t that execution is more important than\nstrategy, but rather that they\u2019re complimentary. Strong execution lets you\ntest and validate bits of strategy before they become company-changing\ndecisions. As you\u2019re moving through life as a startup, there are tons of\nstrategic questions to answer, and in my experience trying to figure those out\nfrom the bottom-up instead of top-down is a much more powerful approach. In\nthe end, these layers help provide a simple guide as we\u2019re making\nprioritization decisions that will ultimately shape the product and company\u2019s\nfuture.\n\nApril 30, 2022\n\n### Try the Variance customer growth platform\n\nJoin some of the world's top software companies that use Variance to power\ndata-driven sales.\n\nGet Started \ud83c\udf89\n\n30-day trial\n\nNo credit card required\n\n#### Subscribe to Variance News\n\nAn inside look at building a company delivered in (roughly) bi-monthly\ninstallments\n\nThanks for signing up.
