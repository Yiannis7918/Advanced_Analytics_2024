Initial testing confirmed the\npresence of smallpox-virus DNA. Further testing, which could take up to two\nweeks, will determine whether the material is live. The samples will be\ndestroyed after the testing is completed.\n\nThere is no evidence that any of the vials had been breached or that workers\nin the lab, which has been used by the Food and Drug Administration for\ndecades, were exposed to infection. FDA employees did not receive an official\ncommunication about the discovery until Tuesday evening. One scientist, who\nworks in the building and spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of\nretaliation, said he learned about it Tuesday when his supervisor read a media\nreport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe FBI and the CDC\u2019s division of select agents and toxins are investigating.\n\n\"Due to the potential bio-safety and bio-security issues involved, the FBI\nworked with CDC and NIH to ensure safe packaging and secure transport of the\nmaterials,\" FBI spokesman Christopher M. Allen said in an e-mail to The\nWashington Post.\n\nExperts explain the biosafety precautions and procedures at the National\nEmerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories. (Boston University)\n\nThis is the first time the deadly virus has been discovered outside the only\ntwo facilities in the world where smallpox samples are allowed, by\ninternational agreement, to be stored \u2014 a highly secure lab at the CDC\nheadquarters in Atlanta and a virology and biotechnology research center in\nNovosibirsk, Russia.\n\nSmallpox \u2014 which vanished from the United States just after World War II and\nwas eradicated globally \u2014 killed hundreds of millions of people in the 20th\ncentury alone.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"It was considered one of the worst things that could happen to a community to\nhave a smallpox outbreak,\" said Michael Osterholm, a expert on bioterrorism\nand director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the\nUniversity of Minnesota. \"It's a disease that's had a major impact on human\nhistory.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no cure for smallpox, and historically about one-third of people who\ncontract it die from the disease. Though not as readily contagious as some\nother diseases, such as influenza, smallpox promises plenty of misery once\ncontracted. Symptoms include high fever, fatigue and fluid-filled lesions that\noften ooze and crust over, leaving survivors irreversibly scarred.\n\nLast month, a safety lapse involving three CDC labs in Atlanta led to the\naccidental release of live anthrax bacteria. The incident resulted in as many\nas 84 employees having to get a vaccine or take antibiotics as a precaution\nand the reassignment of a lab director. Scientists failed to take proper\nprecautions to inactivate bacteria samples before transferring them to other\nlabs not equipped to handle live anthrax.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIt is not entirely clear how the smallpox samples ended up in Building 29A on\nthe NIH campus in Maryland. The building is an FDA lab, one of several the\nagency has operated on the NIH campus since 1972. The vials were discovered\nwhile employees were preparing for the lab\u2019s move to the FDA\u2019s main campus in\nWhite Oak, Md.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn FDA scientist on July 1 found several cardboard boxes containing dozens of\nglass vials, each several inches long and sealed with melted glass, according\nto CDC spokesman Tom Skinner. The boxes were in a storage room kept at about\n40 degrees. Several vials were labeled as flu virus, mumps or typhus, he said.\nSixteen vials were labeled \u201cvariola,\u201d or smallpox, or were suspected of\ncontaining smallpox virus. Those vials were in a box with cotton padding. All\nthe vials were immediately secured in a containment laboratory on the NIH\ncampus. The 16 suspect vials were flown to Atlanta. Testing confirmed the\npresence of smallpox virus DNA in six.\n\n\"This was a lab that didn't realize it had these vials,\" Skinner said. Because\nthe vials are made of glass and were sealed with melted glass, officials say\nthe vials appear to date to the 1950s. He said the material could have been\nsitting around in the storage room \"unbeknownst to the people up there for\nmany years.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn an e-mail late Tuesday, an FDA spokeswoman said the laboratories where the\nsmallpox was discovered are used for biologics research, including research on\nvaccines. The agency noted that the regulation of vaccines, including the\nsmallpox vaccine, was under the authority of NIH until July 1972, when it\ntransferred to the FDA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlthough an investigation is ongoing, it is likely that an investigator\ninvolved in smallpox research, prior to the time that smallpox was eliminated,\nmay have left the boxes in a cold storage area,\u201d FDA spokeswoman Jennifer\nRodriguez said in the e-mail. \u201cThese were then only discovered as part of the\ninventory undertaken in preparation for the move of the FDA laboratories from\nthe NIH campus in Bethesda to the consolidated FDA campus in Silver Spring.\u201d\n\nRodriguez said the agency has completed an inventory of all common storage\nareas in its NIH campus buildings and found no other materials of public\nhealth concern.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cWe are carefully examining our policies and procedures regarding the security\nof our laboratories and storage of biologic specimens,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will\nensure the implementation of a corrective action plan to ensure that our\nbiological specimens are inventoried and properly secured.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout 18,000 people work on the sprawling NIH campus in Bethesda. An NIH\nspokeswoman said the agency is planning a comprehensive search of all\nlaboratory spaces. Officials did not notify employees about the discovery, she\nsaid, because the vials were checked and found to have no breaches. FDA\nlaboratory staffers uninvolved in the discovery were notified by e-mail\nTuesday evening, after the vials had been transferred to the CDC and confirmed\nto contain smallpox, Rodriguez said.\n\nThe CDC notified the World Health Organization. A spokeswoman for the WHO said\nany samples of the smallpox virus found outside the two facilities where it is\nallowed must be moved to those locations or destroyed.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOsterholm, the expert on bioterrorism, likened the discovery to finding a\nlong-forgotten trunk in an attic and said that biologists are no different\nfrom other people, collecting things and storing them. He said government\nofficials handled the discovery appropriately and acted quickly and\ncautiously. \"I'm not convinced this will be the last of these potential\nsituations,\" he said. \"I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere else in the world\nthis same type of thing happens again.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn accidental release of the virus potentially could sicken a small number of\npeople who come into contact with it, though Osterholm said such an outbreak\nprobably could be contained rapidly given today\u2019s vaccine supplies and\nantiviral drugs. The more worrisome prospect, he said, would be if someone\nwith bad intentions were able to aerosolize the virus and spread it over a\nlarge metropolitan area. \u201cThat could be a global crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen smallpox was officially declared eradicated in late 1979, an agreement\nwas reached under which any remaining stocks of the virus would be destroyed\nor sent to one of two secure laboratories \u2014 the CDC in Atlanta or the State\nResearch Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Russia.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn the decades since, the scientific community has wrestled over whether to\ndestroy the remaining stockpiles of the smallpox virus or hang on to them in\ncase they are needed for research.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who argue in favor of destroying the remaining smallpox samples \u2014 a\ngroup that includes D.A. Henderson, who led a worldwide effort to eradicate\nthe disease decades ago \u2014 point out that an effective vaccine exists and that\nmaintaining live samples risks accidental infections or, worse, vials falling\ninto the hands of terrorists. Other scientists, including officials at the CDC\nand NIH, have insisted that there is more valuable research to be done before\nscientists can say confidently that adequate protections exist against any\nfuture smallpox threats.\n\nThis spring at a meeting in Geneva, the World Health Assembly, the WHO's\ndecision-making body, revisited the question over whether to destroy the\nremaining stockpiles of smallpox. Amid sharply divided opinions on the issue,\nthe group postponed a final decision.\n\nSari Horwitz contributed to this report.\n\nRelated: Scientists may have been exposed to anthrax, CDC says\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nTechnology\n\nBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devices\n\nWhy a potential TikTok ban is alive again in Congress, and what\u2019s next\n\nThe AI hype bubble is deflating.
