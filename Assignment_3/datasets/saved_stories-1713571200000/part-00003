The paths go beside the water and\nbelow the streets, which cross the river on Art Deco bridges. A city looks\ndifferent from underneath; you feel its layers of history.\n\nUp at street level the book festival was underway, and in a tent filled with\npeople I talked about Differ We Must, my biography of Lincoln as seen through\nhis encounters with people who disagree with him. Moderator Dan Goodgame,\neditor of Texas Monthly, took the occasion to ask about an item in the news.\nNPR senior business editor Uri Berliner had written an article criticizing the\npeople who work with him. His article alleged that his colleagues are\nunanimously progressive and publish progressive stories without any debate\u2014a\nfailure of \u201cviewpoint diversity.\u201d What did I make of that?\n\nHaving been asked, I answered: my colleague\u2019s article was filled with errors\nand omissions. And having given my opinion in public, it\u2019s fair that I should\nshow my work in this space, where I often discuss NPR and journalism more\nbroadly. Nothing I say here is personal; it\u2019s about the journalism. I\u2019ve\nalready told Uri much of what I am telling you, and I have taken his responses\nseriously. He told me he loves NPR and wants to make it better.\n\nIf Uri wanted to start a discussion about journalism at NPR, he succeeded,\nthough maybe not in the way he intended. His colleagues have had a rich\ndialogue about his mistakes. The errors do make NPR look bad, because it\u2019s\nembarrassing that an NPR journalist would make so many. NPR correspondent\nEyder Peralta wrote on Facebook, \u201cThere are a few bits of truth in this... but\nit mostly suffers from the same thing it accuses NPR of doing. It is myopic\nand uses a selective reading to serve the author\u2019s world views.\u201d\n\nThe errors are so numerous that his defenders\u2014and he has some!\u2014have taken to\nadmitting them, then adding words to the effect of: I hope this doesn\u2019t\nobscure his \u201clarger point\u201d!\n\nIf Uri\u2019s \u201clarger point\u201d is that journalists should seek wider perspectives,\nand not just write stories that confirm their prior opinions, his article is\nuseful as an example of what to avoid.\n\nThis article needed a better editor. I don\u2019t know who, if anyone, edited Uri\u2019s\nstory, but they let him publish an article that discredited itself.\n\nI discussed one example on stage in San Antonio. The article made headlines\nfor Uri\u2019s claim that he \u201clooked at voter registration for our newsroom\u201d in\nWashington, D.C., and found his \u201ceditorial\u201d colleagues were unanimously\nregistered Democrats\u201487 Democrats, 0 Republicans.\n\nI am a prominent member of the newsroom in Washington. If Uri told the truth,\nthen I could only be a registered Democrat. I held up a screenshot of my voter\nregistration showing I am registered with \u201cno party.\u201d Some in the crowd\ngasped. Uri had misled them.\n\nNPR says its content division has 662 people around the world, including far\nmore than 87 in Washington. The article never disclosed this context. (NPR\ndoesn\u2019t ask employees about their voter registration; I don\u2019t know how Uri\nlearned the 87 registrations he says he found.)\n\nWhen I asked Uri, he said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d that I am not a Democrat. He\nsaid the important thing was the \u201caggregate\u201d\u2014exactly what his 87-0\nmisrepresented by leaving out people like me. While it\u2019s widely believed that\nmost mainstream journalists are Democrats, I\u2019ve had colleagues that I was\npretty sure were conservative (I don\u2019t ask), and I\u2019ve learned just since Uri\u2019s\narticle that I am one of several NPR hosts of \u201cno party\u201d registration.\n\nIs there a \u201clarger point\u201d that too many elite journalists share similar\nbackgrounds, and think the same way in assigning and shaping stories? Yes, I\nthink so, but it\u2019s a subtle issue that has more to do with people\u2019s\neducations, experiences and associations than with partisan registration.\nThere\u2019s less of a headline in that. And it\u2019s an issue that NPR has tried to\naddress with some of the people it has promoted, and by leaning more heavily\non reports from our local stations across America.\n\nA careful read of the article shows many sweeping statements for which the\nwriter is unable to offer evidence. He says there is no debate over stories at\nNPR, just a \u201cfrictionless\u201d process like an \u201cassembly line.\u201d I have been\ninvolved in passionate debates over stories at Morning Edition, as Uri knows;\nI have sometimes relied on his advice. Uri is a prominent editor\u2014did he\napprove bad stories without friction?\n\nUri might have made a narrower statement, that certain specific stories are\nnot tested, with too many easy assumptions. Or that we are too willing not to\ncover certain edgy stories. I might have agreed. But that would be a different\nstory than Uri told.\n\nWhen I challenged him, Uri seemed to acknowledge that there is debate,\ncontrary to what he had written. But he said that is not important. He said\nthe real test is what we broadcast or publish.\n\nI agree: the test is what we broadcast. Yet the article keeps failing to nail\ndown what bothers him about the broadcasts.\n\nHe writes of a dismaying experience with his managers: \u201cI asked why we keep\nusing that word that many Hispanics hate\u2014Latinx.\u201d\n\nWhy indeed? It\u2019s true that many Latinos don\u2019t like this ungendered term,\nincluding some who work at NPR. That may be why NPR does not generally use the\nterm. I did a search at npr.org for the previous 90 days. I found:\n\n197 uses of Latino\n\n201 uses of Latina\n\nAnd just nine uses of \u201cLatinx,\u201d usually by a guest on NPR who certainly has\nthe right to say it.\n\nLike Uri, I often have opinions about NPR\u2019s coverage. Sometimes I am right;\nand sometimes I check the easily searchable archives and discover I am wrong.\nI wish he\u2019d done the same.\n\nMy colleague goes on to write that \u201cwe\u201d cover Israel through \u201cthe\nintersectional lens,\u201d as progressives who see a battle of oppressors and\noppressed.\n\nFirst: who is \u201cwe\u201d? I wasn\u2019t aware that the senior business editor has covered\nIsrael, but I have. He seems to have done no research before offering his\nassessment of my philosophy. Or anyone else\u2019s. If he did explore his\ncolleagues\u2019 views on Israel, he would have found some \u201cviewpoint diversity\u201d!\n\nBut that\u2019s beside the point. As Uri said, the test is what we report. His\narticle does not critique a single NPR story on Israel.\n\nSince he mentioned none, allow me. After the Oct. 7 attack, my first interview\nwas with a member of the Israeli war cabinet. When I went to Israel my first\nstory was on a Hamas missile attack; my second was on a Hezbollah attack; my\nthird was on a hostage family. Later, I interviewed Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu. I have also interviewed many Palestinians and even a member of\nHamas, covering all sides as a journalist should.\n\nWhile in Israel, I saw my colleague Daniel Estrin in Tel Aviv and heard from\nmy colleague Anas Baba in Gaza. Both have covered the story fairly, honorably,\nand at great personal cost. Scores of Americans, Israelis and Palestinians\nhave contributed to the coverage.\n\nIf he was going to denounce these colleagues, Uri might at least have picked\nout specific stories that bothered him. Many of us could\u2014I was in a discussion\nabout such a story just a few days ago. But that would be a different story\nthan he told.\n\nThe article does correctly note that in the fall of 2020, NPR did not repeat a\nNew York Post scoop about the discovery of Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop. The article\nleaves out the context: other organizations also held off on the story because\nof doubts about the laptop\u2019s authenticity. It wasn\u2019t confirmed until much\nlater.\n\nAbove all, Uri calls for \u201cviewpoint diversity\u201d but did not seem to embrace it\nfor this article. He didn\u2019t seek comment from anyone or otherwise engage\nanyone who had a different point of view. The failure to vet the story may\nexplain why the errors and omissions all go in one direction, toward\nconfirming the writer\u2019s pre-existing opinions.\n\nA little vetting would have been good for the writer and his cause. This is\nespecially true in the article\u2019s lengthy attack on NPR\u2019s diversity efforts.\n\nIf you conducted a confidential survey, you would hear a lot of \u201cviewpoint\ndiversity\u201d within NPR about those efforts! And opinion would not break down\nentirely on racial lines. But Uri\u2019s lengthy attack on those efforts had a\nparticular effect on readers. One perceptive reader was Kenya Young of WNYC, a\npublic radio station executive in New York. She is former senior manager at\nNPR, and widely respected. \u201cThe entire long diatribe,\u201d she wrote on Facebook,\n\u201cactually did not need to be included at all to make his points (some of which\nI believe to be valid), so the fact this it was shows me exactly where he\u2019s\ncoming from and (disappointingly) how he feels about the much needed changes\nthat had to happen at NPR.\u201d\n\nHere is a prominent member of the community Uri says he wants to influence. He\nhas her attention! And she is receptive to what he has to say! Then he loses\nhis audience through an irrelevant \u201clong diatribe.\u201d The story is written in a\nway that is probably satisfying to the people who already believe it, and\nunpersuasive to anyone else\u2014a mirror image of his critique of NPR.\n\nIf we separate that critique from its messenger, there are things to talk\nabout, as Kenya Young says. We are broadcasting to a divided society, at a\ntime when news media consumption has broadly declined. We are competing with\nmany news organizations, and some of them make it part of their business model\nto tell their audiences not to trust NPR. It\u2019s a tough crowd! And NPR can do\nmore to rise to that challenge.\n\nMany journalists describe the debate within their profession as not so much\nleft vs. right as younger vs. older, or old-school journalism vs. a more\nactivist position. Such debates can be good; but sometimes the traditionalists\nhave fallen silent or struggled to find the language to hold up their end of\nthe discussion. Uri was one who spoke openly, but ineffectively. He didn\u2019t\nwork any of the beats he complained about, which might be why his critique\nmisfired so wildly.\n\nMy view is neither the old-school model nor the radical one. I don\u2019t think we\nneed new rules of journalism, but do need better execution of the rules we\nalready have, as I have described in this Substack. We need to report and\nwrite more rigorously, and prove every point we make, conscious that someone\nout there will definitely not be on the same page. We need to be curious. We\nneed to keep searching for new voices, and new facts. The whole of humanity is\nout there to be covered.\n\nDiffer We Must is a reader-supported publication.

Regarding the voter\nregistrations, Berliner never claimed that every single NPR editorial member\nof the DC Bureau was a registered Democrat, as this commentary suggests. The\nclaim was that there were 87 registered Democrats and 0 registered\nRepublicans. This, of course, leaves open that some or many were not\nregistered to a party.2\\. Regarding the Biden laptop story, it is hardly\nexculpatory to rely on the errors of other institutions. Indeed, it just\nsupports the widely held notion that these institutions exist as an echo\nchamber. It appears that the decision to ignore the laptop was based on\n\"doubts about the laptop's authenticity.\" But isn't that the job of\njournalists? To get to the bottom of such doubts rather than accept the doubts\nas outcome-determinative.3\\. Relatedly, this commentary flat-out ignores the\nmain thrust of Berliner's article, which is that NPR badly mangled - always in\na consistent direction - the major news stories of the last 8 years. Russian\ncollusion, COVID, police funding, etc. were all completely misreported. This\nwas a result, Berliner argues (without refutation) of a homogenous\nnewsroom.Expand full commentLike (77)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n134 replies\n\nPeter BensonApr 16My goodness.
