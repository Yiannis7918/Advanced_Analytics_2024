With all the concerns about the future of cinemas \u2013\nas in the actual buildings where you go to watch movies \u2013 when you take a step\nback and consider why many are struggling, it's often because the experience\njust isn't very good.^1 You pay a bunch of money to go watch a movie in a room\nthat is often less comfortable (and sometimes dirtier) than your own living\nroom with a screen that is not that much larger than the one on your wall. The\npandemic further focused this reality and made it so that people only wanted\nto go if there was either a must-see movie in the zeitgeist or a unique\nexperience.\n\nThe latter is where IMAX comes in. And actually, with Oppenheimer and Dune\nPart 2, the former was in play as well in the past year.\n\n> The success of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and last month\u2019s \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d which earned\n> roughly 20% of their ticket sales from Imax, demonstrates the force of the\n> Imax brand. When audiences go to the movies, they overwhelmingly choose to\n> see films in Imax. In the process, Imax, with its sprawling screens and\n> carefully calibrated sound systems, has become the gold standard for ticket\n> buyers. (People crossed state and country lines to see \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in 70\n> mm Imax, selling out auditoriums for weeks. More recently, theaters added 3\n> a.m. and 6 a.m. Imax showings of \u201cDune 2,\u201d which was shot with Imax lenses,\n> to meet demand.)\n>\n> \u201cI strongly believe that the future of cinema is linked with Imax,\u201d says\n> Denis Villeneuve, the director of \u201cDune 2.\u201d \u201cIt just conveys a level of\n> quality.\u201d\n\nHard to get a more ringing endorsement than that. And Christopher Nolan is an\neven stronger advocate for the format and experience.\n\n> To make money, Imax licenses its technology \u2014 its screens, sound systems and\n> projectors \u2014 to various theater companies. It also allows filmmakers to\n> choose between its two kinds of photography equipment: a film camera (there\n> are only eight in existence), like the ones Nolan used on \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d and\n> an array of Imax-certified lenses that modify digital cameras, such as those\n> deployed on \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d The company overindexes on ticket sales for\n> the films that are shot with its technology.\n\nYet this love and increasing success hasn't (yet) translated to Wall Street as\nIMAX CEO Rich Gelfond conveys in his colorful way:\n\n> Yet even as Imax has become invaluable to filmmakers like Villeneuve and\n> Nolan, the company struggles to get respect from Wall Street. That\n> frustrates Gelfond, an unflappable lawyer turned entertainment executive who\n> helped transform Imax from a purveyor of nature documentaries into a\n> Hollywood powerhouse. It was Gelfond who orchestrated a 1994 leveraged\n> buyout of the company, took it public and, over several decades, enlisted\n> studios to showcase their biggest films on Imax\u2019s patented screens (allowing\n> them to charge more for tickets in the process). His pitch worked \u2014 studios\n> now vie for the company\u2019s cameras and limited number of venues. (Imax has\n> 1,772 auditoriums \u2014 a fraction of the 250,000 screens worldwide.) Yet Imax\u2019s\n> share price has languished at roughly $16, down from the more than $19 it\n> was trading at a year ago.\n>\n> \u201cInvestors like to invest based on comparables,\u201d Gelfond says, \u201dand there is\n> no other Imax.\u201d\n>\n> Gelfond thinks Imax is being valued like AMC Theatres, Cineworld and other\n> major cinema chains, which are mired in debt as they grapple with the\n> overhead required to maintain hundreds of locations at a time when\n> attendance is still lower than it was pre-pandemic. \u201cI like to say we have\n> as much in common with North American exhibitors as we do with steel\n> companies,\u201d Gelfond says, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a totally stupid line.\u201d\n\nIt's an interesting model \u2013 as Gelfond notes, they don't actually own any\ntheaters, and don't sell concessions \u2013 which is pretty bespoke:\n\n> There\u2019s a reason that Imax prizes its relationships with auteurs like Nolan,\n> Todd Phillips, Jordan Peele and Paul Thomas Anderson, to name a few\n> filmmakers who have worked, or will work, with Imax. These top directors can\n> harness the power of TikTok influencers as they promote their movies,\n> usually stressing that Imax is not just an optimal viewing experience, but\n> the way their films were meant to be seen.\n>\n> \u201cDirectors need to know that Imax is one of the greatest partners you can\n> have,\u201d says Phillips, who used Imax cameras on both \u201cJoker\u201d movies. \u201cIf you\n> show them a little love by embracing the format, they give it back to you 10\n> times.\u201d\n>\n> Imax rewards loyalty. Its employees are made available early in the\n> filmmaking process to troubleshoot issues with movies that use the company\u2019s\n> film cameras. That\u2019s important because Imax film cameras are massive and\n> hard to maneuver. Though Villeneuve would have liked to use them for \u201cDune\n> 2,\u201d logistics won out, and he eventually opted to shoot on digital. \u201cThe\n> film cameras look better, but we were shooting in the heat of the desert and\n> needed more flexibility,\u201d he says.\n\nSo IMAX both vets who they work with and forces those filmmakers to use their\ntechnology for filmmaking and presenting. And the resulting quality seemingly\npays off, quite literally. In that regard, it's almost like HBO \u2013 well, the\nold HBO \u2013 meets technology, just a specific, cinema-focused bit of technology.\nAmazingly Gelfond has gotten this all to work even when betting on an auteur\nlike Nolan over the biggest (and last true) movie star in the world, Tom\nCruise \u2013 as the article notes, he bet on Oppenheimer over the seventh Mission:\nImpossible movie, even though the latter seemed like a slam-dunk blockbuster\nwhile the former was based on an 800-page historical biography about science.\n\n> For movies from a director like Nolan, who only shoots on film, Imax finds\n> experts who can still operate the few dedicated projectors that use old-\n> school film stock, a rarity in a mostly digital business. In some cases,\n> projectionists have been moved across the country so they can work in\n> certain Imax venues. Because Imax goes to such lengths, Gelfond says, many\n> employees approach their jobs with unusual intensity.\n>\n> \u201cA long time ago,\u201d Gelfond says, \u201csomeone said to me, \u2018People at Imax think\n> they\u2019re curing cancer.\u2019 And I said to them, \u2018Don\u2019t tell them they\u2019re not.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe big theater chains obvious reaction to the rise of IMAX has been to try\neverything just short of Smell-O-Vision:\n\n> Still, Imax must contend with an armada of rivals. There\u2019s no shortage of\n> other high-end presentations, known as premium large formats, on the market,\n> like 4DX, Cinemark XD and Event Cinimas-branded V-Max. But in the fight for\n> audiences, Gelfond says all screens aren\u2019t created equal.\n>\n> \u201cI think exhibitors do their best to confuse the consumer. They put an \u2018X\u2019\n> in all their titles,\u201d he says of rival companies whose names look a lot like\n> \u201cImax.\u201d \u201cEither that or it\u2019s a funny coincidence.\u201d\n>\n> The difference, he says, is some of the other brands aren\u2019t doing much to\n> improve the quality of the image before slapping a surcharge on admission.\n> Instead, they\u2019re using an ordinary projection on a larger screen. Imax,\n> however, works with directors to alter the film, increasing the resolution\n> and sharpness of the larger-than-life footage.\n>\n> \u201cI remember when I was a kid and I copied my hand on a Xerox machine. The\n> more you blew it up, the worse it looked,\u201d Gelfond says. \u201cThat\u2019s the dirty\n> little secret of other PLFs \u2014 the image is bigger and people pay more for\n> it, but it\u2019s actually not a better image.\u201d\n\nI know it sounds crazy now, but I don't think it's totally crazy to imagine a\nfuture where a certain type of big movie opens on IMAX and then heads to\nsomething like Apple's Vision Pro. I'm just not sure what the point of a big\nchain movie theater is anymore. They're lucky the distribution window, which\nwas shattered during COVID, was brought back.^2 But it's just delaying the\ninevitable.\n\n> \u201cAmerica is built on capitalism. Where it crosses the line is when they try\n> and say, \u2018As good as Imax\u2019 or \u2018Better than Imax.\u2019 I understand their\n> business reasons, but it\u2019s just an entirely different thing.\u201d\n\n^1 To be clear, there are many great, independent movie theaters in the US and\naround the world. It's largely the mega chains that have ruined it for\neveryone. (A few smaller chains, like Alamo Drafthouse, are an exception --\nbut always seemingly in trouble or about to sell... It feels like the studios\nare going to have to step in more fully once again, the ultimate plot twist.)\n\n^2 Though not nearly as strict -- even Dune 2 is hitting the home next week,\njust six weeks after its insanely popular theatrical run. In the past, this\nwould have been a six month wait.\n\n#film #tech #imax #christopher nolan #denis villeneuve #entertainment\n\n### Published by:\n\n### You might also like...\n\nApr\n\n11\n\n## \"Most of the time, nothing happens.\"\n\nApr\n\n11\n\n## Alexa, Are We Over?\n\nApr\n\n10\n\n## 'Snow' Show No More\n\nApr\n\n09\n\n## Apple Ferrets Out UI for AI\n\nApr\n\n09\n\n## Skydance Nears Summit of Paramount\n\nSpyglass \u00a9 2024\n\nPowered by Ghost\n\n", "frontpage": false}
