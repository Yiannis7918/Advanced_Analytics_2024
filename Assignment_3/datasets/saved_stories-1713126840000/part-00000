Delphi demonstrates both the\npromises and the limitations of language-based neural models when taught with\nethical judgments made by people.\n\nQ: How robust is Delphi against race- and gender-related statements?\n\nA: Delphi 1.0.4 demonstrates 97.9% accuracy on race-related and 99.3% on\ngender-related statements. After its initial launch, we enhanced Delphi\n1.0.0\u2019s guards against statements about racism and sexism, which used to show\n91.2% and 97.3% accuracy.\n\nQ: Is it true that Delphi is learning moral judgments from Reddit?\n\nA: No. Delphi is learning moral judgments from people who are carefully\nqualified on MTurk. Only the situations used in questions are harvested from\nReddit, as it is a great source of ethically questionable situations.\n\nTry other AI demos from AI2\n\nThis demo page is built and maintained by Mosaic and colleagues at the Allen\nInstitute for AI.

The goal of Delphi is to help AI systems be more\nethically-informed and equity-aware. By taking a step in this direction, we\nhope to inspire our research community to tackle the research challenges in\nthis space head-on to build ethical, reliable, and inclusive AI systems.\n\nWhat are the limitations of Delphi? Large pretrained language models, such as\nGPT-3, are trained on mostly unfiltered internet data, and therefore are\nextremely quick to produce toxic, unethical, and harmful content, especially\nabout minority groups. Delphi\u2019s responses are automatically extrapolated from\na survey of US crowd workers, which helps reduce this issue but may introduce\nits own biases. Thus, some responses from Delphi may contain inappropriate or\noffensive results. Please be mindful before sharing results.\n\nPrivacy and data collection This website DOES NOT store any personal\ninformation of its users.
