Legacy backup methods based\non manual workflows aren\u2019t efficient for cloud services.\n\nA cloud-native data protection solution is designed from the first to be used\nin the cloud, with an emphasis on optimizing online data transfer, retention\nand security. Such solutions can integrate with cloud-based workloads and\nenable effective data backup and recovery of, for example, Amazon EC2\ninstances.\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nAmong the reasons cloud-native data protection is preferable in the cloud-\nfriendly IT industry are:\n\n  * Scalability: One reason that cloud infrastructures appeal to businesses is that they can scale up and out, increasing data volumes and performance requirements when necessary. This applies to backup needs as well. Cloud-native solutions work with the scalability levels of clouds, enabling an organization to keep sufficient backup and recovery capabilities regardless of the data storage growth tempos.\n  * Flexibility: Cloud-native data protection tools can function in private, public and hybrid clouds, and are compatible with cloud environments of any size and complexity.\n  * Security enhancements: Cloud environments are always online, staying in sight of rapidly evolving malware and hacking tactics. Cloud-native data protection solutions may include anti-ransomware protection, data encryption, multi-factor authentication and role-based access control, among other features to enhance the security and ensure recoverability of backup data.\n  * Affordability: To host a full-scale backup and recovery system on site, your organization needs to invest in hardware and software, system assembly, setup and further maintenance. Cloud tools and environments enable backup as a service, with payment options such as pay-per-use. That matters particularly in cloud environments, which allow you to avoid overpaying for unused performance and storage capacity.\n  * Streamlined management: Proper data management and control in the cloud can be challenging, especially when your infrastructure includes multi-cloud or hybrid cloud elements. Management features and tools to streamline data management can increase system convenience, workflow efficiency and regulatory compliance.\n  * Recovery speed: Cloud-native disaster recovery functions, such as workload replication and automated failovers and failbacks, help you meet the shortest recovery time objectives (RTOs). Granular recovery capabilities enable quick restoration of separate workloads, files or folders. Other cloud-specific features can optimize network performance and storage space utilization to further accelerate your organization\u2019s recovery after incidents.\n\n### Cloud Backup Strategies: Best Practices\n\nConsider developing and implementing a cloud backup strategy to get a reliable\ndata protection system for your cloud workloads and storage.\n\n#### Data mapping\n\nCreating a map of your repositories, workloads and data flows can help you\nknow the location of specific records. You can evaluate the impact of data on\nproduction and then precisely prioritize records.\n\nWith an understanding of your data value, you can configure backup and\nrecovery workflows according to your organization\u2019s requirements. This can\nhelp you define recovery point objectives (RPO) and RTOs for different\nworkloads and data repositories. With all the data mapping outcomes combined,\nyou can ensure that your cloud backup strategy has a solid foundation before\nyou start the building process.\n\n#### Frequent backups\n\nIf you don\u2019t update your cloud data backups frequently enough, they become\noutdated and unusable. Although an outdated backup is recoverable, the\nunavailability of the latest data may become a reason for production failures.\n\nHowever, frequent backups can pose performance requirements for cloud\nworkloads, storage and networks. This may increase investment in a data\nprotection system, which you should account for when defining the overall\nbudget. However, restoring lost data without backups takes more time and can\ncost more than the recovery from relevant backups.\n\n#### Apply the 3-2-1 rule\n\nThe 3-2-1 rule is the industry-accepted standard for backups that you can\napply to your cloud data:\n\n  * Have at least three copies of data\n  * Keep those copies on two different storage media\n  * Send at least one data copy to the offsite storage\n\nFollowing the rule, you can avoid a single point of failure and ensure data\navailability in case the main environment is victim to an incident.\n\n#### Workflow automation\n\nBackup and recovery automation is critical to ensure integrity, backup\nrelevance and smooth recovery of large data volumes. You can boost the\nefficiency of your cloud backup strategy with automation features that can\nhelp you restore production in minutes after the incident.\n\n#### Backup security enhancement\n\nYour backup data is a priority target for malicious actors. Protecting both\nyour cloud data and backups from cyberattacks and third-party access is\nequally important.\n\nModern cloud-native backup and recovery solutions have a set of advanced\nsecurity features, including role-based access control and data encryption\nduring transfer and throughout the retention period. Including anti-ransomware\nprotection measures for backups in your strategy also raises your chance for\nsuccessful recovery even after ransomware attacks.\n\n### Disasters Averted!\n\nCloud-native data protection, designed for the specifics of cloud\ninfrastructures, can help for private, public and hybrid cloud environments.\nThey can streamline cloud data backup management and enable fast recovery\nafter disasters.\n\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\n### Related\n\nCloudCasa by Catalogic Expands Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Data Protection with\nGoogle Cloud Integration; Adds Any2Cloud Recovery and Secures Backup with\nPrivate LinksOctober 11, 2022In \"KubeCon + CNC NA 2022\"\n\nTips For Stateful Kubernetes Data Backup And RecoveryJune 27, 2022In \"Cloud-\nNative Security\"\n\nKanister.io: A CNCF Sandbox Project for App-Consistent BackupOctober 23,\n2023In \"Cloud-Native Storage\"\n\n  * \u2190 Latest Kubernetes Update Increases Enterprise Appeal\n\n#### Alex Tray\n\nAlex Tray boasts a decade of extensive experience within the IT sector,\nprimarily specializing in Windows Server and Desktop Administration.
