This post will go into detail on how I came to this\nconclusion.\n\n## The backstory\n\nAll relicensing stories are built on the same narrative around Open Source. A\nstory that goes like this:\n\nAt the dawn of the computer age, software was not considered valuable, it was\nall about the hardware. Very expensive proprietary machines would be sold, but\nthe people using those would develop the software running on them as a commons\nand share it freely.\n\nDon DeBold from San Jose, CA, USA, CC BY 2.0\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe 80s and the rise of the PC made the hardware more and more of a commodity,\nand that made the software more and more valuable. Software companies like\nMicrosoft were created and with it the proprietary software approach: A single\nentity owns the software that is produced, and that entity intends to capture\nall value that derives from the software, thanks to restrictive licensing\nconditions.\n\nThat approach led to a lot of excesses, especially as Microsoft decided to\nexploit that dominant position. Openly-developed Open Source software grew in\nthe 90s in reaction to this evil proprietary approach. In this model, software\nis produced as a commons by a community of organizations and individuals\nopenly collaborating, and value is shared among the participants in the\ncommunity. This is all made possible thanks to free and Open Source licenses\nwhich guarantee a number of freedoms, like the freedom to build on it without\nasking for permission, and the freedom to use it for any purpose, including\nmaking money.\n\nIn the next 20 years, Open Source got overwhelmingly popular and unleashed a\nsoftware revolution. A recent study by researchers at Harvard Business School\nestimated the demand-side value of Open Source software to be $8.8 trillion!\nIn other words, without Open Source, companies would have to pay 3.5 times as\nmuch for software than they currently do. It\u2019s estimated that 96% of software\ncontains an Open Source component. Developing new software today without using\nany Open Source would be a pretty challenging endeavor.\n\nLike everyone else, companies that produce software massively adopted Open\nSource. They leveraged tons of libraries and software produced as Open Source,\nthey benefited from not having to ask for permission before innovating and\nused those freedoms to write their own software. They released the end product\nunder an Open Source license and they vouched they would forever be Open\nSource. We called their software \u201csingle-vendor Open Source.\u201d\n\nWith the internet becoming more ubiquitous, some of those also turned to a\nsoftware-as-a-service (SaaS) monetization model. But with the rise of the\ncloud, hyperscale public cloud companies also turned to providing Open Source\nsoftware at scale, and that\u2019s seen as unfair competition for those small Open\nSource software companies using a SaaS model. That means today those same\ncompanies say that while Open Source is good for initial visibility, it\u2019s bad\nfor monetization. It\u2019s bad for business. As is, Open Source is not business-\nfriendly, so they need to invent new licenses to continue defending openness\nagainst evil proprietary software while making a living. They still provide\naccess to their code for free and in some cases, those licenses transform into\nreal Open Source licenses after a few years... What\u2019s not to love?\n\n## Three misconceptions\n\nThe last part of this narrative is built on three misconceptions worth\ndeconstructing. First, it\u2019s built on the idea that Open Source is great\nbecause you don\u2019t have to pay for it. So if you preserve that aspect, all is\ngood. The trouble is that Open Source is not great because you don\u2019t have to\npay for it. Open source is great because everyone is free to use it. It\u2019s a\nsubtle distinction: Cost is definitely a factor in your freedom to use Open\nSource. But this goes beyond monetary barriers: What matters is not having to\nask for permission. Just use it. Anyone, anywhere, to do anything. Not just\npeople with deep pockets and not just the ones in certain countries.\n\nThis permissionless innovation has enabled a ton of valuable software (itself\noften released as Open Source), which fed into the virtuous cycle that we\nbenefit from today. The non-compete licenses some companies come up with\nrestrict you from doing anything with the software that they disagree with or\nconsider \u201ccompetition,\u201d under pretty vague and untested legal terms. The\nresult is that it ends permissionless innovation: you can no longer just use\nit.\n\nThe second misconception is that single-vendor Open Source is, somehow, the\nreasonable and business-conscious way to do Open Source. You should be on\nboard if you want Open Source to win against proprietary software. But those\ncompanies are still doing what is, essentially, proprietary software: like the\nproprietary software companies of the 80s, they very much consider the\nsoftware being produced as their exclusive property. They still intend to\ncapture all the value that derives from it. And thanks to copyright\naggregation or permissive licensing, they still can change the license any\ntime they want. So it\u2019s still proprietary: they just choose, for now, to\nrelease their software under an Open Source license.\n\nSingle vendor isn\u2019t a reasonable way to do Open Source and resist evil\nproprietary software. It\u2019s just another way to do proprietary software. It\u2019s\njust a relicensing time bomb. And sure enough, a lot of those time bombs\nexploded over the past year. The proprietary development model is moving back\nto restrictive licensing, in a predictable attempt to capture incrementally\nmore value. This was predictable if only we had seen single-vendor Open Source\nas the temporary tactic of proprietary development that it always was.\n\nThe last misconception is that proprietary software is evil. This whole\nrationale wouldn\u2019t hold if we didn\u2019t demonize proprietary software in the\nfirst place and opposed Open Source and proprietary. But, as we\u2019ve seen, you\ncan be proprietary and do Open Source as a temporary tactic! So it\u2019s not as\nsimple as Open Source vs. proprietary. Here\u2019s what it looks like in quadrant\nform:\n\nOn one axis, the license used is either Open Source (as defined by the Open\nSource Initiative (OSI), which I would summarize as coming with all freedoms\nnecessary to enable the permissionless innovation I mentioned earlier) or it\u2019s\nnot. On the other axis is the development model: it\u2019s either developed as a\ncommons, by a community working in open collaboration, or it\u2019s developed (and\nultimately owned) by a single entity.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing today is that proponents of the proprietary development\nmodel are abandoning their Open Source licensing tactic and are moving back to\nrestrictive licensing. They hope they can retain enough aura from their Open\nSource days to hide the fact that it\u2019s just restricted software and pretend to\nkeep the fight for openness against evil proprietary software. But proprietary\nsoftware is not evil. It\u2019s just inferior.\n\nAnyone who truly thinks that software developed by a diverse set of actors\nworking in an open collaboration is not better should just adopt the\nproprietary model. But they should be honest about it. True evil lies in\ndeception and hypocrisy: Claiming openness while practicing proprietary\ntactics (openwashing), diluting the meaning of Open Source by creating\ndeceptively-named restrictive licenses (like \u201cCommons Clause\u201d) or switching\nlicenses from under your community after having promised, like Hashicorp, to\nremain Open Source forever.\n\n## A call to action\n\nIt\u2019s time to remind everyone that the permissionless innovation they benefit\nfrom can\u2019t be taken for granted. It\u2019s a direct consequence of the prevalence\nof Open Source licenses, as defined by the OSI. And it requires all of the\nOpen Source freedoms, including the freedom to use the software for any\npurpose.\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back and describe what a world where the relicensing\nproponents win would look like. If their vision wins, if everyone adopts this\napproach, all the innovation that Open Source freedoms allowed to unleash\nwould come to a halt and we\u2019d quickly be back to where we were in the 80s.\n\nImagine a world where you have to ask lawyers for permission before using any\nlibrary, or any programming language! They\u2019ll say for some licenses it\nautomatically becomes Open Source after some time, so it\u2019s not a big deal. But\nthat\u2019s a trap, too: Imagine a world where you have to run a buggy two-year-old\nversion with known vulnerabilities because that\u2019s the Open Source one.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s also time to reassert the value of software developed in an open\ncollaboration. Everything else is proprietary. Everything else is a\nrelicensing time bomb. Beware of Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) when\nthey are not held by an openly-governed non-profit. Beware of single-vendor\nOpen Source software, it\u2019s a proprietary development model that happens to\ntemporarily use Open Source licensing. So yes, let\u2019s all agree: Single vendor\nis the new proprietary.\n\nDisclaimer: All published articles represent the views of the authors, they\ndon\u2019t represent the official positions of the Open Source Initiative, even if\nthe authors are OSI staff members or board directors.\n\n### Author\n\nWritten by\n\nThierry Carrez\n\nGeneral Manager at OpenInfra Foundation, and Vice-chair at OSI.\n\n### Support us\n\nOpenSource.net is supported by the Open Source Initiative, the non-profit\norganization that defines Open Source.\n\nBecome a member today\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * Community, Guides\n\n## Build efficient Bash scripts with templates\n\nDavid Both\n\n  * Guides, News\n\n## Write once, run forever: The power of Bash scripts\n\nDavid Both\n\n## Trending\n\n  * Community, Guides\n\n## Build efficient Bash scripts with templates\n\nDavid Both\n\n  * Guides, News\n\n## Write once, run forever: The power of Bash scripts\n\nDavid Both\n\n  * Guides, News\n\n## Apache Groovy: Write files with ease\n\nChris Hermansen\n\n  * Guides, News\n\n## PyTorch\u2019s Hidden Gems: Dynamic Graph Power\n\nMichelle Buckner\n\nPowered by open, united by community.\n\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Mastodon\n  * Twitter\n\nSupported by the Open Source Initiative\n\nCode of conduct | Privacy policy | Contact\n\nAll articles are copyright of the authors and licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License.\n\nImages are copyright of the authors.
