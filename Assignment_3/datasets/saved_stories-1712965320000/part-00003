Date: April 12, 2024 1 Likes 486 Views\n\nFrom our friend of the program, curator of the Free Tools Association (FTA)\nand creator of the ActiveGS Plugin and iOS app emulator \u2013\n\nBack in 2011, I published my first iPhone app as a tribute to my Apple 2GS/FTA\ndays. It was both a challenging journey to develop for iPhone 3GS/4 and iOS\n3.2 back then, but also the beginning of a hectic journey... as the app was\nbanned by Apple 2 years later for violating the infamous 2.8 -no emulator-\nrule.\n\nYet, last Friday, something magical occurred as Apple revised its policies!\nWithin a couple of days, I was finally able to update this 15-year-old app\n(running 35-year-old emulated code) to have it re-instated in the App Store...\nmore than a decade after its initial ban.\n\nNever give up, never surrender; for tomorrow may hold unexpected surprises!\n\n(If you like very old oldies and are an Apple 2GS die-hard fan, you can have a\nlook at https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/activegs-best-of-fta/id405115025, but\nplease, be indulgent...)\n\nShare: TwitterFacebookPinterestRedditVKDiggLinkedinMix\n\nAuthor: A.P.P.L.E.\n\nThe A.P.P.L.E.
