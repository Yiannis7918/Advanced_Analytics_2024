The answer,\nit seems, is more intrusive advertisements.\n\nLast week, Janko Roettgers, a technology and entertainment reporter, uncovered\na dystopian patent filed last August by Roku, the television- and streaming-\ndevice manufacturer whose platform is used by tens of millions of people\nworldwide. The filing details plans for an \u201cHDMI customized ad insertion,\u201d\nwhich would allow TVs made by Roku to monitor video signals through the HDMI\nport\u2014where users might connect a game console, a Blu-ray player, a cable box,\nor even another streaming device\u2014and then inject targeted advertisements when\ncontent is paused. This would be a drastic extension of Roku\u2019s surveillance\npotential: The company currently has no ability to see what users might be\ndoing when they switch away from its proprietary streaming platform. This is\napparently a problem, in that Roku is missing monetization opportunities!\n\nAlthough the patent may never come to fruition (a spokesperson for Roku told\nme that the company had no plans to put HDMI ad insertion into any products at\nthis time), it speaks to a dispiriting recent trend in consumer hardware.\nInternet-connected products can transform after the point of purchase in ways\nthat can feel intrusive or even hostile to users. Another example from Roku:\nJust last month, the company presented users with an update to its terms of\nservice, asking them to enter a pre-arbitration process that would make it\nharder to sue the company. On one hand, this isn\u2019t so unusual\u2014apps frequently\nforce users to accept terms-of-service updates before proceeding. But on the\nother, it feels galling to be locked out of using your television altogether\nover a legal agreement: \u201cUntil I press \u2018Agree\u2019 my tv is essentially being held\nhostage and rendered useless,\u201d one Roku customer posted on Reddit. \u201cI can\u2019t\neven change the HDMI input.\u201d\n\nA Roku spokesperson confirmed that a user does have to agree to the latest\nterms in order to use the company\u2019s services but said that customers have the\noption to opt out, by sending a letter, in the actual mail, to the company\u2019s\ngeneral counsel (though the window to do so closed on March 21). \u201cLike many\ncompanies, Roku updates its terms of service from time to time,\u201d the\nspokesperson told me. \u201cWhen we do, we take steps to make sure customers are\ninformed of the change.\u201d\n\nBack in the day, a TV was a TV, a commercial was a commercial, and a computer\nwas a computer. They have now been mixed into an unholy brew by the internet\nand by opportunistic corporations, which have developed \u201cautomatic content\nrecognition\u201d systems. These collect granular data about individual watching\nhabits and log them into databases, which are then used to serve ads or sold\nto interested parties, such as politicians. The slow surveillance colonization\nof everyday electronics was normalized by free internet services, which\nconditioned people to the mentality that our personal information is the\nactual cost of doing business: The TVs got cheaper, and now we pay with our\ndata. Not only is this a bad deal; it fundamentally should not apply to\nhardware and software that people purchase with money. One Roku customer aptly\nsummed up the frustration recently on X: \u201cWe gave up God\u2019s light (cathode rays\nand phosphorus) for this.\u201d\n\nAnd this phenomenon has collided with another modern concern\u2014what the writer\nand activist Cory Doctorow evocatively calls \u201censhittification.\u201d The term\nspeaks to a pervasive cultural sense that things are getting worse, that the\ndigital products we use are effectively being turned against us. For example:\nApart from its ad-stuffed streaming devices, Roku also offers a remote-control\napp for smartphones. In a Reddit post last month, a user attached a screenshot\nof a subtle ad module that the company inserted into the app well after\nlaunch\u2014gently enshittifying the simple act of navigating your television\nscreen. \u201cJust wait until we have to sit through a 1 minute video ad before we\ncan use the remote,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t give them any ideas,\u201d another\nreplied.\n\nCory Doctorow: This is what Netflix thinks your family is\n\nPart of Doctorow\u2019s enshittification thesis involves a business-model bait and\nswitch, where platforms attract people with nice, free features and then turn\non the ad faucet. Roku fits into this framework. The company lost $44 million\non its physical devices last year but made almost $1.6 billion with its ads\nand services products. It turns out that Roku is actually an advertising\ncompany much like, say, Google and Meta. And marketing depends on captive\naudiences: commercial breaks, billboards that you can\u2019t help but see on the\nhighway, and so on.\n\nElsewhere, companies have infused their devices with \u201cdigital rights\nmanagement\u201d or DRM restrictions, which halt people\u2019s attempts to modify\ndevices they own. I wrote last year about my HP inkjet printer, which the\ncompany remotely bricked after the credit card I used to purchase an ink-\ncartridge subscription expired. My printer had ink (that I\u2019d paid for), but I\ncouldn\u2019t use it. It felt like extortion. Restrictive rights usage happens\neverywhere\u2014with songs, movies, and audiobooks that play only on specific\nplatforms, and with big, expensive physical tech products, such as cars. The\nentire concept of ownership now feels muddied. If HP can disable my printer,\nif Roku can shut off my television, if Tesla can change the life of my car\nbattery remotely, are the devices I own really mine?\n\nRead: My printer is extorting me\n\nThe answer is: not really. Or not like they used to be. The loss of meaningful\nownership over our devices, combined with the general degradation of products\nwe use every day, creates a generally bad mood for consumers, one that has\nstarted to radiate beyond the digital realm. The mass production and Amazon-\nification of cheap consumer goods is different from, say, Boeing\u2019s decline of\nquality in airline manufacturing allegedly in service of shareholder profits,\nwhich is different from televisions that blitz your eyeballs with jarring ads;\nyet these disparate things have started to feel linked\u2014a problem that could be\ndefined in general by mounting shamelessness from corporate entities. It is a\nfeeling of decay, of disrespect.\n\nIn some areas, it means that quality goes down in service of higher margins;\nin others, it feels like being forced to expect and accept that whatever can\nbe monetized will be, regardless of whether the consumer experience suffers.\nPeople feel this everywhere. They feel it in Hollywood, where, as the reporter\nRichard Rushfield recently put it, the entertainment industry is full of\nexecutives \u201cwho believe the deal is more important than the audience\u201d\u2014and that\nconsumers ultimately \u201chave no choice but to buy tickets for the latest Mission\nImpossible or Fast and Furious\u2014because they always have and we own them so\nthey\u2019ll see what we tell them to see.\u201d People feel it in unexpected places\nsuch as professional golf: Recently, I was surprised to read an issue of the\nFried Egg Golf newsletter that compared NBC Sports\u2019 weak PGA Tour broadcasts\nto the ongoing debacle at Boeing. \u201cIs there a general lack of morale amongst\npeople right now?\u201d the author wrote. \u201cDoes anyone take pride in their work? Or\nare we just letting quality suffer across all domains for the sake of cutting\ncosts?\u201d\n\nThese last two examples aren\u2019t Doctorowian per se: They are merely things that\npeople feel have gotten worse because companies assume that consumers will\naccept inferior products, or that they have nowhere else to go. In this sense,\nDoctorow\u2019s enshittification may transcend its original, digital meaning. Like\ndoomscrolling, it gives language to an epochal ethos. \u201cThe problem is that all\nof this is getting worse, not better,\u201d Doctorow told me last year when I\ninterviewed him about my printer-extortion debacle. He was talking about\ncompanies locking consumers into frustrating ecosystems but also about\nconsumer dismay at large. \u201cThe last thing we want is everything to be inkjet-\nified,\u201d he said.\n\nDoctorow\u2019s observation, I realize, is the actual reason I and so many others\nonline are so worked up over a theoretical patent that might not come to\nfruition. Needing to do a hostage negotiation with your television is\nannoying\u2014enraging, even\u2014but it is only a small indignity. Much greater is the\ncreeping sensation that it has become standard practice for the things we buy\nto fail us through subtle, technological betrayals. A little surveillance\nhere, a little forced arbitration there. Add it up, and the real problem\nbecomes existential. It sure feels like the inkjets are winning.\n\nCharlie Warzel is a staff writer at The Atlantic and the author of its\nnewsletter Galaxy Brain, about technology, media, and big ideas.
