This\nlethargic reptile, which mostly dwells underground and eats just three to four\ntimes a year, is the unlikely inspiration for one of pharma\u2019s biggest\nblockbusters: a new generation of weight-loss drugs that has patients\u2014and\ninvestors\u2014in a frenzy. Originally made for diabetes, evidence is growing that\nthey also have benefits in diseases of the heart, kidney, liver and beyond.\n\nSince the late 1980s scientists believed that a gut hormone called glucagon-\nlike peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is secreted by the intestines after a meal,\ncould help treat diabetes. GLP-1 increases the production of insulin (a\nhormone that lowers blood-sugar levels) and reduces the production of glucagon\n(which increases blood-sugar levels). But GLP-1 is broken down by enzymes in\nthe body very quickly, so it sticks around for only a few minutes. If it were\nto be used as a drug, therefore, patients would have faced the unwelcome\nprospect of needing GLP-1 injections every hour.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get the full story\n\n### Enjoy a month of insightful analysis for free.
