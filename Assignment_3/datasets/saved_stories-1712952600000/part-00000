At Arduino, he collaborated with Google to create the world's first\ndeveloper-friendly embedded AI kit. Dominic is co-founder & principal\nconsultant at Astur.\n\n## Leadership\n\n### Product 0-1\n\nAs a Product Manager I took entry-level Arm Cortex-M processors from concept\nto global launch, partnering with the world's leading semiconductor companies\nand OEMs to deliver one of the fastest growing products in Arm's history.\n\nRoadmapping\n\nCompetitive Analysis\n\nData-Driven Decision Making\n\nRequirements Gathering\n\nProduct Launch\n\nCross-Functional Collaboration\n\n### Strategy\n\nAs Arm's Director IoT Segment I drove Arm beyond its traditional audience to\nengage developers of emerging applications directly and accelerate into new\nmarkets. I built partnerships with the hardware startup ecosystem, Raspberry\nPi, and Arduino.\n\nVision\n\nStrategic partnerships\n\nTeam Leadership\n\nMarket Analysis\n\nIndustry Recognition\n\nPress and Analyst Briefings\n\n### Ecosystem\n\nAt Arduino, I worked with Google to enter the nascent embedded AI market. The\nlaunch reached hundreds of thousands of developers, and led to a partnership\nwith Harvard University to deliver an Arm Cortex-M based kit for their TinyML\ncourse.\n\nInnovation\n\nDevelopers\n\nMass Market\n\nStartups\n\nMarket Entry\n\nPrototyping\n\nAnalytics\n\n## Values\n\nAccess to a computer at an early age opened up huge opportunities for me, so\nI'm a big believer in Arduino and Raspberry Pi lowering barriers for the next\ngeneration of kids - and companies. I've seen first hand that vast scale is\npossible if you inspire people with the potential of technology, and empower\nthem to create.\n\nTechnology keeps moving forward. As an industry we have to be life-long\nlearners, and teachers.\n\n## Prototyping\n\nThe best way to truly understand the potential of a technology is to built\nwith it. These are just a few of the projects I've built for research, for\ndemos, or for fun.\n\n### GenAI / Mixed Reality\n\nImagine conjuring any object into existence on command. In the VoxelAstra\nproject I combined voice recognition and generative AI to create a mixed-\nreality experience that let you do just that. Built over the holidays, it was\nmainly just tested with snowmen.\n\n### TinyML\n\nAt Arduino I used color and proximity sensor data with on-device ML to detect\nfruit variety and ripeness. The accompanying blog I wrote is featured in\nTensorFlow Blog.\n\n### Robotics\n\nThis project for READY Robotics used live motor torque data for training and\ninference of preditive maintenance AI. As well as integrating this flow end-\nto-end, I built a live dashboard and 3D visualization.\n\n### Social Media\n\nBBC Micro Bot took geek Twitter by storm. People pushed the limits of\npossibility within one tweet of retro code. It gained millions impressions,\nand thousands of users who between them submitted over 10,000 programs. Now on\nMastodon.\n\n### Spatial Computing\n\nVirtual Beeb is a free computer simulation in a webpage. Now ported to mixed-\nreality using WebXR, you can experience it today on Meta Quest 3 and Apple\nVision Pro!\n\n### Web\n\nAI copilots have made coding vanilla sites fast! I built and open sourced this\nsite in case it's useful to anyone else. Did you try the interactive Conway's\nGame of Life at the top of the page?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Dominic Pajak CC BY-NC-SA\n\nFollow me:\n\n", "frontpage": false}
