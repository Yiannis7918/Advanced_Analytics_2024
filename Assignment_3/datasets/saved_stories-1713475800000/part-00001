How we can tell that eyes are watching us\n\nShare Share Share\n\nIntegrative Neuroimaging Research\n\n20 September 2016\n\nHarriet Dempsey-Jones, University of Oxford\n\nWe\u2019ve all had that feeling that somebody is watching us \u2013 even if we\u2019re not\nlooking directly at their eyes. Sometimes we even experience a feeling of\nbeing watched by someone completely outside our field of vision. But how can\nwe explain this phenomenon without resorting to pseudoscientific explanations\nlike extrasensory perception (or a \u201csixth sense\u201d)?\n\nThe human fascination with eyes lies at the heart of the issue. Eyes are the\nwindow into the soul, goes the saying. And it\u2019s no wonder we\u2019re so interested\nin them \u2013 the human brain is highly tuned to lock onto the gaze of others.\nIt\u2019s been suggested that there\u2019s a widespread neural network in the brain just\ndedicated to the processing of gaze. Scientists have already identified a\nspecialised group of neurons in the macaque brain that fire specifically when\na monkey is under the direct gaze of another.\n\nWe also appear to be wired for gaze perception. The mechanism that detects\neyes and shifts our attention towards them may be innate \u2013 newborns just two\nto five days old prefer staring at faces with direct gaze, for example, (over\naverted gaze).\n\nIt\u2019s not just our brains that are specialised to draw us to the gaze of others\n\u2013 our eyes are also exceptionally formed to catch attention and easily reveal\nthe direction of gaze. Indeed, our eye structure is distinct from almost all\nother species. The area of our eye surrounding our pupil (the sclera) is very\nlarge and completely white. This makes it very easy to discern the direction\nof someone\u2019s gaze. In many animals, by contrast, the pupil takes up a lot of\nthe eye, or the sclera is darker. This is thought to be an adaptation to\ncamouflage the eye in predators \u2013 cleverly hiding the direction of gaze from\npotential prey.\n\nIt can be hard to tell exactly where a cat is looking. Pixabay\n\nBut why is gaze so important that it needs all this specialised processing?\nBasically, eyes provide us with insights into when something meaningful is\nhappening. Shifts in attention from another person are able to, almost\nreflexively redirect our attention in line with their gaze. Our heightened\nattention to gaze is thought to have evolved to support cooperative\ninteractions between humans, and is argued to form the foundation for many of\nour more complex social skills.\n\nDisturbances of normal gaze processing are seen across a wide range of\nconditions. For example, people on the autistic spectrum spend less time in\ngeneral fixating on the eyes of others. They also have more trouble extracting\ninformation from eyes, such as emotion or intentions, and are less able to\ntell when someone is looking directly at them. On the other extreme, highly\nsocially anxious people tend to fixate on eyes more than those with low\nanxiety, even though they show increased physiological fear reactions when\nunder the direct gaze of another.\n\nYou may not realise it, but eye gaze affects something so primitive as our\npsychological reactions to other people. It is a large cue in establishing\nsocial dominance. Also, here\u2019s a tip: direct gaze makes people appear more\ntrustworthy and attractive (you\u2019re welcome). This also seems to apply to\nanimals. One study suggested that dogs may have evolved to adaptively react to\nour gaze preferences. It found that dogs in a shelter that gaze at humans\nwhile furrowing their inner brows (momentarily making their eyes look larger)\nget adopted significantly faster than dogs that didn\u2019t.\n\nGaze also helps unconsciously regulate turn-taking in our conversations \u2013\npeople more often than not look away while talking (as compared to when\nlistening), and we typically exchange a mutual gaze with our partner to\nindicate a changeover between talking and listening. Try messing with this\nnatural gaze flux \u2013 you will probably weird out your conversational partner.\n\n## The truth about gaze detection\n\nBecause the human eye gaze is optimised for easy detection, it is often easy\nfor us to work out whether someone is looking at us. For example, if someone\nsitting right opposite you on the train is looking at you, you can register\nthe direction of their gaze without looking directly at them. However, it\nturns out we can only reliably detect such gaze within four degrees of our\ncentral fixation point.\n\nHowever, we can use other cues to tell when someone is looking at us in our\nperipheral vision. Typically we also rely on the position or movement of their\nhead (such as a turn towards you). We also rely on head or body cues when the\npotential watcher is in the dark or is wearing sunglasses. But, interestingly,\nyou may not be right about being watched as often as you think. It turns out\nthat in uncertain situations, people systematically overestimate the\nlikelihood that the other person is looking at them. This may be an adaptation\nto prepare us for interactions that are about to occur, particularly if the\ninteraction may be threatening.\n\nProbably nobody there. J Walters\n\nBut what about the feeling that someone outside your field of vision, such as\nbehind you, is watching? Is it really possible to \u201csense\u201d that? This has long\nbeen a source of scientific investigation (the first study on this was\npublished in 1898) \u2013 probably because this idea is very popular. Some studies\nhave found that up to 94% of people report that they have experienced the\nfeeling of eyes upon them and turned around to find out they were indeed being\nwatched.\n\nSadly for those who wish we were X-men, it appears much of the body of\nresearch supporting the \u201cpsychic staring effect\u201d appears to be suffering from\nmethodological issues, or unexplained experimenter effects. For example, when\ncertain experimenters act as the watcher in these experiments, they seem to be\nmore \u201csuccessful\u201d at getting people to detect their stares than other\nexperimenters. It is almost certainly an unconscious bias, perhaps due to\ninitial interactions with the experimenter.\n\nMemory biases may also also come into play. If you feel like you are being\nwatched, and turn around to check \u2013 another person in your field of view might\nnotice you looking around and shift their gaze to you. When your eyes meet,\nyou assume this individual has been looking all along. Situations where this\nhappens are more memorable than when you look around to find no one looking at\nyou.\n\nSo remember \u2013 the next time you think someone you can\u2019t see is watching you,\nit could be your mind playing tricks on you, no matter how real it feels.\n\nHarriet Dempsey-Jones, Postdoctoral Researcher in Clinical Neurosciences,\nUniversity of Oxford\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.
