It has been over 15 years since this\nbook was last in print. The original book was published by WhiteWalls, and\nwe've taken on the printing of this new edition. The second printing is\nidentical to the 2020 edition, save for the correction of a tiny handful of\ndetails.\n\nThis greatly expanded new edition includes over 80 additional pages of\nmaterial including many new drawings and writings about prisoners' inventions\nthat Angelo created after the last printing, new writing from Temporary\nServices, blueprint drawings by Angelo of his prison cell, and photo\ndocumentation of the cell's recreation for Temporary Services' exhibitions of\nthe project. The book also has a completely new design by Partner & Partners.\nWe could not be happier that a new generation of readers will finally get to\nsee this book, and that longtime fans who have worn out their original copies\nwill be able to have this fresh, expanded edition.\n\nFrom the back cover:\n\nIn 2001, the group Temporary Services invited their friend Angelo, a prisoner\nin California, to write about and draw the different things he had seen other\nprisoners invent.\n\nAngelo illustrated everything from immersion heaters with electrical plugs\nmade from razor blades, paper clips, and popsicle sticks, to cooking methods\nfor bologna jerky on built-in cell light fixtures. These drawings and writings\nbecame the book and widely exhibited project Prisoners\u2019 Inventions, first\npublished in 2003.\n\nThis redesigned and expanded edition of Prisoners\u2019 Inventions includes many\npages of additional drawings and writings that Angelo produced after the last\nprinting, as well as a new introduction by Temporary Services that details the\norigins and life of the project. Prisoners\u2019 Inventions reveals an often-\nneglected side of prison existence: the need to create those objects and\nexperiences that allow the most basic human desires to be satisfied.\n\nCurrent Stock:\n\n770\n\nWeight:\n\n0.95 LBS\n\nWidth:\n\n9.50 (in)\n\nHeight:\n\n6.50 (in)\n\nDepth:\n\n1.00 (in)\n\nShipping Cost:\n\nCalculated at Checkout\n\nClose\n\n# Create Wishlist\n\n## No Reviews Write a Review\n\n## Related publications\n\n  * Quick View\n  * Add to Cart\n\nPublic Collectors\n\n### Angelo's Ashes or To Live and Die in L.A.\n\n$5.00\n\n  * Quick View\n  * Add to Cart\n\nHalf Letter Press\n\n### Fish-Ins & Black/Native Solidarity in the 1960s\n\n$7.00\n\n  * Quick View\n  * Add to Cart\n\nHalf Letter Press\n\n### Leftover Rightunder\n\n$10.00\n\n  * Quick View\n  * Add to Cart\n\nPublic Collectors\n\n### Legal Concealers\n\n$12.00\n\n  * Quick View\n  * Choose Options\n\nHalf Letter Press\n\n### Mobile Phenomena\n\n$8.00\n\n  * Printed\n  * Digital\n  * Wholesale\n  * FREE\n  * Archive\n\n  * Temporary Services\n  * Public Collectors\n  * Half Letter Press\n  * Breakdown Break Down Press\n  * AREA Chicago\n  * Koenig\n  * Journal of Aesthetics & Protest\n  * Free the Future Press\n  * Soberscove Press\n  * Josh MacPhee\n  * View all publishers\n\n  * About\n  * Shipping & Returns\n  * Wholesale Information\n  * Newsletter\n  * Contact\n\nYour cart is empty.\n\n### Join our mailing list\n\nWe promise to send only good things.\n\nP.O.
