A couple of years\nago, I found myself seeking to expand my design services into the U.S. market,\naiming to offer subscription-based design services to startups and venture\ncapital firms.\n\nThe problem is that I'm from Eastern Europe, and my English isn't strong\nenough for fluent video meetings. Faced with a language barrier, I turned to\nmy partner, Roman Hokhloff, an experienced sales expert, for help.\n\nThanks to this limitation, Roman built a customer engagement funnel that\nallowed us to get paid without live conversation. As a result, our design\nservices turned into an AI startup aiming to revolutionize the sales\ndepartment.\n\n> If you have no problem talking to customers, you definitely want to have\n> fewer live meetings, get more warm leads, and make more sales. In this\n> story, I'll show you how, step by step, using readily available and\n> affordable tools, you can start increasing your sales.\n\nI know that most of those reading this material are independently searching\nfor potential clients on LinkedIn, writing them the first cold message, and\ntrying to arrange a demo call. By following at least some of the steps\noutlined in this article, you'll make your job a lot easier, and you'll be\nable to get a lot more client meetings.\n\n### Step One: Prospect Gathering\n\nWe began by assembling a pool of potential clients and leveraging tools like\nSales Navigator on LinkedIn to identify companies that fit our ideal customer\nprofile. This step was crucial in setting the foundation for our outreach\nstrategy. Sales Navigator is not the only tool. For example, the base can also\nbe gathered in Apollo or Lusha. There are other ways and sources, but these\nare the most popular.\n\n### Step Two: Automating Outreach\n\nNext, we employed Waalaxy to automate our LinkedIn outreach efforts, sending\npersonalized connect requests and initial messages. You can check out other\ntools, like Buzz AI. Each has its pros and cons.\n\nInitially, we offered a free template with a marketing website structure to\navoid needing a demo presentation. But later, making such templates became\nlabor-intensive, and we had to solve the demo issue.\n\nAt the time, our website looked like this: tocoway.webflow.io\n\nIt is important to note that this approach has obvious disadvantages:\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Manual analysis and testing. What is the response conversion rate? Should\nthe message be changed to improve the response rate, etc.?\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Time-consuming to communicate. The average number of messages in a dialog is\nbetween 5 and 15.\n\n> Looking ahead, today at this stage, we are working with an AI bot that\n> learns and changes its strategy if it fails to engage the interlocutor in a\n> dialog. But when we first started, we used template messages.\n\n### Step Three: Scheduled a Demo\n\nIf the contact went to the contact and responded to automated messages, we\nengaged in a dialog to confirm the customer's need and tailor a solution for\nthem. The targeted action of this funnel was to invite an interested customer\nto a Demo meeting. The customer signed up for the meeting via Calendly. In\nreality, these were pre-recorded webinars, cleverly designed to simulate a\nlive interaction, thus personalizing the experience without direct\ninvolvement.\n\n### Step Four: The Demo\n\nOn Fiver, we hired an actress to record a webinar-style presentation.\n\nWe hosted this video on a webinar platform. You can find many webinar hosting\nand automation platforms, or try EverWebinar which has good functionality.\n\nBefore the meeting, the client was informed that it would be a group meeting.\nThe client could ask questions in the chat and receive answers from the\nmoderator in real-time. This approach allowed us to engage with clients in\nreal time during these webinars without the need for our direct involvement in\nevery presentation.\n\nIf this seems complicated, you can offer to watch a demo instead of a video\nmeeting and direct the user to a video hosted on your website.\n\n> \ud83d\udcac\u2757\ufe0f Write in comments if you want to learn more about how to automate demo\n> meetings. If we get more than 20 comments, I'll make a separate post with a\n> link to our video, terms of reference for the actor and tips on automation.\n\n### The Final Step: Closing the Deal\n\nThe final step was closing the sale, which we managed through follow-up\ncommunications on LinkedIn. It's a dance of persuasion, where each message is\ncrafted to inch closer to that decisive 'yes.'\n\nThe thrill of this phase is unparalleled. Our first client, a venture capital\nfirm based in Atlanta, navigated through our sales funnel without a single\nlive conversation, culminating in a $2,100 transaction entirely via LinkedIn.\nIt was proof that we had the right strategy.\n\n### \ud83d\udc49 Still not enough\n\nAfter making a few sales, we realized that it is possible to sell products or\nservices in the United States using messages only, even if the product costs\nseveral thousand dollars. But despite our early success, we quickly realized\nthat to minimize personal involvement, we needed a new approach. Even with an\nautomated demo meeting, someone has to handle the communication, right? So, we\nneed a sales manager who is responsible for every funnel step. We weren't\nready for it, and we stopped.\n\nAnd here we are, a year later, Roman has implemented AI in our other local\nbusiness, Leadhero. Leadhero was founded in 2020 and helped SMBs get leads\nthrough automated calls. However, due to the specifics of the channel, these\nleads didn't get warm enough, so Roman started using AI in messengers to have\nmeaningful dialogs with the prospects after the first call, preparing the lead\nfor further communication with a salesperson. And it was a game-changer.\n\nAll that remained was to combine AI capabilities with outbound sales. So we\nreturned to the U.S. market, but this time not as a design service but as\nGenerative AI managers for sales.\n\n### The Culmination of Our Efforts: Tocoway AI\n\nTocoway represents the evolution of our initial sales process into a fully\nautomated system powered by AI. At every stage of our sales funnel, we employ\nAI managers capable of conducting meaningful conversations with potential\nclients across various platforms, including LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and Telegram.\nThese AI managers are trained to identify customer needs and guide them toward\nthe desired action, whether attending a demo or registering for a service.\nMost importantly, they start the dialog first.\n\nThe Tocoway AI operates without human intervention, boasting impressive\nconversion rates at every funnel stage.

And even if you're not ready to accept that in 2024, you don't need\nlive people to build your sales team, you can at least simplify your work and\nautomate some of the processes.\n\n> \ud83d\udcac\ud83d\ude4f We're curious to hear your thoughts.
