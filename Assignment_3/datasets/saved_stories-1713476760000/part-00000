They think about how to\nmeasure their business growth and how to get to the next order of magnitude\nscale. If they\u2019re making $1M ARR today, they think about how to get to $10M\nARR. If they have 1,000 users today, they think about how to get to 10,000\nusers.\n\nThis made me wonder if/how people are measuring personal growth. I don\u2019t want\nto use metrics like net worth or the number of followers, because that\u2019s not\nwhat I live for. After talking with a lot of friends, I found three\ninteresting metrics: rate of change, time to solve problems, and number of\nfuture options.\n\nSome friends told me they find this blog post mildly sociopathic. Why do I\nhave to measure everything? Life is to be lived, not to be measured. As\nsomeone lowkey fascinated by numbers, I don\u2019t see why measuring and living\nhave to be mutually exclusive \u2013 measuring often helps me live better \u2013 but I\nsee where they come from. This post is more of a thought exercise than a\nrigorous experiment.\n\n## Rate of change\n\nI have this theory that life has a circadian rhythm. Every 3-6 years, you\nbecome a different person. You work on different problems. Your lifestyle\nchanges. The people you hang out with are different. If you haven\u2019t caught up\nwith a friend in 5 years, you might no longer have anything in common. It\u2019s\nnot a coincidence that schools are structured into chunks of 3-6 years.\n\nLooking back, I realized that every 3-6 years, my life completely changed.\nFrom grade 3 to grade 10, I did competitive math. For the next 5 years, I\nworked as a writer. Then I went to college and studied computer science for 4\nyears. After that, I fumbled around for almost 6 years. It was only recently\nthat I felt like I had a handle on life.\n\nSami, a new friend who loves designing strategy games, told me about the rule\nof 72 in finance. It\u2019s a simple formula that estimates the number of years it\nwill take for an investment to double in value. If the annual interest rate is\n8%, it\u2019ll take 72/8 = 9 years for the value of your investment to double.\n\nI wonder if I could treat myself as an investment, and measure my growth by\nhow long it\u2019d take me to become a new person. Becoming a new person isn\u2019t\nalways a good thing, and probably not the goal for everyone. But for me, it\nis. I want to be able to see things from a new perspective. I want to be\nexposed to new challenges. I treasure old friends (I still talk to my best\nfriends in elementary school), but I like learning from new friends.\n\n## Time to solve problems\n\nQuynh, an old friend who runs a publishing house in Vietnam, believes that\nthere are three big problems in life: career, family, and finance. It usually\ntakes people a decade to figure each out.\n\n  1. For the first decade after graduation, you figure out what you want to do with your life.\n  2. For the next decade, you get married, buy a house, and have kids.\n  3. For the next decade, you build out your savings to retire.\n\nHer goal is to solve these problems as fast as possible, so she can focus on\nother more interesting problems.\n\nThis made me think that perhaps I can measure my growth by looking at what big\nproblems I\u2019ve solved. What big problems was I worried about 5 years ago that I\nno longer worry about now? What big problems am I worried about now that I\ndon\u2019t want to worry about in 5 years?\n\nWhat is considered a big problem depends on each person. For me, it\u2019s career,\nfinance, social, immigration, family, and health. Here are a couple of\nconcrete examples that made me feel like I\u2019ve made progress. 5 years ago, I\nwas anxious about being in the US on a visa. This problem went away when I got\nmy green card. 5 years ago, I constantly felt insecure like I was an imposter\nin the Bay. Today, I feel at home here.\n\n## Number of future options\n\nA friend I\u2019ve met through my Discord, Denys, told me that his friend has this\ntheory that every few years, half of your dreams die. People give up on their\ndreams because they realize that they can no longer achieve them.\n\nI disagree. As I grow older, I have more dreams. I now know many things that I\ndidn\u2019t know before, and I have access to more resources than I ever did. This\nallows me to do things that I used to think of as impossible.\n\nDuring a reinforcement learning course in college, I learned about empowerment\nmaximization. It\u2019s a simple principle that enables robots/agents to exhibit\nrelatively intelligent behavior. In the face of uncertainty, an agent\nfollowing empowerment maximization would choose the action that maximizes\nfuture options. For example, facing multiple switches, it\u2019d choose the switch\nthat opens the most doors.\n\nI realized that this is the same principle that I\u2019ve followed. In the face of\nuncertainty, I lean towards the decision that would give me the most future\noptions. For example, I\u2019d choose a job that pays less but gives me more job\noptions in the future (e.g. if the job gives me exposure like allowing me to\nwork on open source or publish papers). I\u2019d prioritize tasks that teach me\ntransferable skills instead of tasks that teach me niche, narrow skills.\n\nPerhaps I can measure my growth by how many new options I have gained/lost.\nWhat options are available to me today that were not available to me 5 years\nago? What options were available to me 5 years ago that aren\u2019t available to me\nnow? More importantly, what options that are not available to me today do I\nwant 5 years from now?\n\nSami pointed me to this image from Wait But Why. As time goes by, many doors\nare closed to us, but many new doors open up. Denys\u2019s friend was referring to\nthe black lines on the left, and I focus on the green lines on the right.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere are three heuristics that I follow for personal growth:\n\n  1. I try to become a new person every 3-6 years.\n  2. I try to solve big problems as fast as possible. I think of this as creating safety nets that allow me to take bigger risks and explore more things in the future.\n  3. I take actions that help me maximize future options.\n\nThese heuristics work for me (so far) because I have a strong bias towards\nnovelty and exploration. Maybe one day, I\u2019ll get tired of exploration, and\nthese heuristics will change. When that happens, that\u2019ll be growth.\n\n  * chip@[thiswebsite]\n  * chiphuyen\n  * chipro\n  * chipiscrazy\n  * huyenchip19\n  * chiphuyen\n\nI help companies deploy machine learning into production.
