A company that's used to almost any problem being solved\nby hitting a breakpoint and entering a debugger, suddenly facing a universe of\natoms, and physics, and far-away factories with lots (and lots) of\nuncontrollable variables, not to mention shipping companies.Ridiculous? Yes.\n(Ultimately) successful? Also yes!The journey of creating Playdate, our indie\nbright-yellow handheld video game system (and now, platform!) was fulfilling,\nbut also challenging, but also really fulfilling. And if you some time to\nspare, I'd love to share with you a collection of stories about the ups,\ndowns, and inside-outs of hardware development, some key learning moments we\nhad along the way, and maybe even some thoughts about just, you know, running\na business in general.
