In it, a humanoid android lifts\nitself up from the floor by bending its legs backward and then swivels its\nfathomless void of a head a full 180 degrees like it\u2019s Linda Blair in The\nExorcist. The footage is obviously creepy.\n\nIn a press release, the company said that it decided to make the new, fully\nelectric Atlas robot move like an undead Cirque du Soleil performer\n(paraphrasing) because it can more efficiently complete tasks when it is not\n\u201cconstrained by a human range of motion.\u201d I am OKAY with this! Boston Dynamics\nis doing exciting things with technology!\n\nI do, however, have a novel suggestion for Boston Dynamics: give the robot\nhair. Watch the video again, but this time, imagine Mx. Atlas with a lush,\nflowing mane. Does that make you feel better?\n\nOkay, press that play button one more time, but now, imagine the bot with a\nhealthy coat of brightly colored fur, Furby-style. Are you feeling more\nrelaxed? I am.\n\n### Related\n\n  * Boston Dynamics\u2019 new Atlas robot is a swiveling, shape-shifting nightmare\n\nKarl MacDorman, the associate dean at Indiana University\u2019s Luddy School of\nInformatics, Computing, and Engineering, who researches the uncanny valley,\ntold me that the reason people find robots like the Atlas creepy is because\n\u201cit moves in a way that violates all human expectations.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine the same robot, but you put human skin on it,\u201d MacDorman said. \u201cIt\nwould be much worse because our expectations of human behavior would be even\nstronger.\u201d\n\nBut what about giving Atlas hair? \u201cFor this robot, it would be quite\nincongruous because we generally wouldn\u2019t expect a human to be covered in fur\nunless maybe it\u2019s a caveman,\u201d MacDorman said. \u201cIt would probably make it more\nuncanny, but it might be better than skin.\u201d\n\nWhat about an ape android covered in hair? \u201cIf you can have an ape-like robot\nthat is moving around in strange ways, it would probably be less disturbing,\u201d\nMacDorman said. In his research about nonhuman animals and the uncanny valley,\nhe found that people still find synthetic creatures uncanny, but the feeling\nis more acute when it comes to human-like robots.\n\nMacDorman emphasized that what really makes Atlas creepy is not the hair, or\nlack thereof, but the inhuman movement. Masahiro Mori, the scientist\nresponsible for the theory of the uncanny valley, created two separate graphs\nfor the uncanny valley: one for still objects and another for moving things.\nThat feeling of uncanniness, MacDorman told me, \u201cis much more pronounced for\nmoving objects.\u201d\n\nThe academic literature on hairy robots is sadly limited \u2014 and the results are\nmixed. In a paper published in 2019, scientists compared people\u2019s reactions to\nrobots with plastic exteriors, wooden exteriors, and fur exteriors.\nResearchers found that \u201cpeople rated the plastic robot significantly lower on\nperceived warmth as compared to the wooden and furry robots,\u201d but also,\n\u201cpeople did not rate the three robots differently in terms of competence or\ndiscomfort.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a study published in 2022 titled \u201cDesigning Man\u2019s New Best Friend:\nEnhancing Human-Robot Dog Interaction through Dog-Like Framing and Appearance\u201d\nnoted that Boston Dynamics\u2019 (fur-free) dog-like robot \u201creceived praise for its\nepic dancing moves online but when deployed in New York for street\nsurveillance, caused concern among residents who were disturbed by these\nrobots.\u201d\n\nWould fur have made any difference? The researchers had 29 participants play\nwith Aibo, a robot dog manufactured by Sony. When they added fur to Aibo, they\nwere surprised to find that it \u201cinhibited social reactions like smiling and\nlaughing when Aibo was framed as a puppy,\u201d adding:\n\n> One explanation may be that the fur suit did not cover the entire Aibo, but\n> only part of its body. This may have resulted in a somewhat \u201cuncanine\u201d\n> effect, although this was not reflected in subjective reports.\n\nIf the researchers had only asked me, I could\u2019ve shared a lesson that\u2019s just\nas true in robotics as in so many other areas of life: half measures\n(partially furred robot dogs) will not do (induce social reactions like\nsmiling and laughing).\n\nNo, if robot makers want to inspire affinity instead of repulsion with their\ncreations, they need to accept what the creative industry has long understood:\nhair sells, the more the better. Need proof? Just look at the most beloved\nmonster of the last 10 years:\n\nPhoto by Len Redkoles / NHLI via Getty Images\n\nIconic.\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## The invisible seafaring industry that keeps the internet afloat\n\n  2. ## The free Delta game emulator for iPhones is live on Apple\u2019s App Store\n\n  3. ## Sony might have perfected Mini LED TVs with its new 2024 lineup\n\n  4. ## Google fires 28 employees after sit-in protest over Israel cloud contract\n\n  5. ## Nine Google employees arrested after eight-hour sit-in protest\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from this stream Boston Dynamics Atlas robot: a full history\n\n  * ### Boston Dynamics\u2019 new Atlas robot is a swiveling, shape-shifting nightmare\n\nApr 17, 2024, 5:39 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Boston Dynamic\u2019s Atlas robot has picked up some new tricks.\n\nFeb 7, 2024, 12:28 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Boston Dynamics\u2019 Atlas robot is tossing tool bags around a (fake) construction site\n\nJan 18, 2023, 4:23 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Boston Dynamics shows how bipedal Atlas robot flips, vaults, and falls over in latest videos\n\nAug 17, 2021, 2:00 PM UTC\n\nSee all 18 stories\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
