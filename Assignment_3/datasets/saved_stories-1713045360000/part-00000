Occasionally, the steady gurgling is interrupted by\nannouncements and the rumbling of light rail vehicles.\n\nOn the boarding platform of Chinatown-Rose Pak Station last Thursday, 100 feet\nunderground, a steady stream of water fell from the ceiling onto the tracks\nand walkway, some captured in two buckets surrounded by orange safety cones.\nIt smelled of sulfur, and the nearby wall was damp and coated in a residue\napparently left behind by a trickle.\n\nWater pooled in the trackway, and ceiling panels were missing over the\nplatform. One section of tracks was visibly rusty. A bug zapper hung from a\nwall by an empty chair, apparently to kill insects attracted by the swampy\nconditions. More water pooled in the glass-encased elevator shaft.\n\n\u201cLeaks are everywhere,\u201d said a station agent who asked not to be named because\nhe was not authorized to speak to the press by his bosses at the San Francisco\nMunicipal Transportation Agency.\n\nA bug zapper hangs in the Central Subway's Chinatown-Rose Pak Station on April 4 as station experienced water leaks. | Source: Alex Mullaney/The Standard\n\nEd Siu of the Chinatown Merchants United Association said his members have\nbeen asking the SFMTA to fix the leaks for the last 16 months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally ridiculous,\u201d Siu said. \u201cIt\u2019s brand new. We spent a lot of tax\nmoney for it.\u201d\n\nThe $1.9 billion, 1.7-mile-long Central Subway was San Francisco\u2019s first new\nsubway in more than 40 years. The project arrived four years late and hundreds\nof millions of dollars over budget.\n\nWhen it officially opened in January 2023, extending the T-Third Street line\nfrom Bayview to Chinatown, the transportation agency touted it as a way to\nprovide \u201cfaster, smoother transit service between some of the city\u2019s busiest,\nmost vibrant areas.\u201d But last August, a leak at the Chinatown-Rose Pak Station\nforced the closure of the main stairwell from the concourse level to the\nplatform, inconveniencing riders. Officials said the leaks would take at least\nsix months to fix. Eight months later, the cash-strapped agency is still\nworking out repair plans.\n\nHowever, internal emails between SFMTA staff and consultants reveal that there\nare persistent leaks throughout the subway and its three subterranean\nstations.\n\nA section of the platform is blocked off due to water leaks at Chinatown-Rose Pak Station in San Francisco on April 11. | Source: Estefany Gonzalez/The Standard\n\n## Containing the leaks\n\nThe Chinatown-Rose Pak Station was a complicated engineering problem from the\nstart because the water table in the area is very high and the station itself\nis very deep.\n\nTo deal with this, dewatering wells were used to lower the water table so the\nstation could be built with a waterproof membrane wrapped around it.\n\nBut water has risen to the top of the station\u2019s main cavern and begun to enter\nat construction joints, according to an Aug. 8 internal presentation on the\nleaks by SFMTA Deputy Director of Maintenance of Way Terrance Fahey. There are\nspaces between the \u201cwater stops\u201d\u2014devices that wick the water away\u2014at\nconstruction joints and the waterproofing membrane.\n\n\u201cBeyond concerns for patrons slipping on the terrazzo flooring, water seepage\nin the long run will start corroding fasteners holding up the glass fiber-\nreinforced concrete panels, steel conduit and concrete reinforcement,\u201d Fahey\u2019s\npresentation warned.\n\nLeaks and water damage are seen in the Central Subway on April 4. | Source: Alex Mullaney/The Standard\n\nIn emails, staff wrote that leaks have emerged in back-of-house rooms: The\nplatform elevator shaft area on Aug. 8, 2023, the fan room on Oct. 8, 2023,\nand the air conditioning room on Jan. 4 of this year.\n\nThe subway does have a drainage system that allows water to run out of the\ntunnel, \u201cbut the leaks that we\u2019re trying to address are on the roof of the\ntunnel,\u201d transportation agency spokesperson Michael Roccaforte said. \u201cThe\nsystem for water mitigation helps contain the leaks and run the water through\npipes out to the sewer.\u201d\n\nBART owns and manages much of the Muni Metro. Its tunnel between Embarcadero\nand 16th Street Mission stations is below the water table, meaning either\nseawater or freshwater is constantly a threat. BART\u2019s maintenance crews are\nsaid to call the stretch of trackway \u201cthe rainforest.\u201d\n\n\u201cBART has leaks. But they have a budget, staff and plan; they address it, and\nthey fix it,\u201d said Nadeem Tahir, the Central Subway\u2019s former project director.\n\u201cThis is all new for SFMTA. They need to fix the leaks that are there, make a\nlong-term plan and then execute. They\u2019ve hired some of the best experts.\nUnfortunately, SFMTA had to wait to find the cash. Otherwise, this work would\nhave been done a long time ago.\u201d\n\nWater pools around the tracks at Chinatown-Rose Pak Station. | Source: Estefany Gonzalez/The Standard\n\nThe Central Subway tunnel was built with special holes for grout to be\nrepeatedly injected over it to seal it. Think of it like a roof that needs to\nbe rebuilt as it periodically gets washed away.\n\n\u201cIt will take time and effort to fill voids with grout and isolate areas that\nare leaking until we can finally plug them,\u201d Fahey wrote in his presentation.\n\nWater intrusion even cost the SFMTA two retail leases to Dragon City Inc.\u2014the\nbusiness behind AA Bakery and Cafe on Stockton Street. Henry Chan, the owner,\nsaid he was frustrated by the situation, but understood the necessity of the\nrepairs.\n\nThe retail spaces \u201care unavailable for leasing by a long-term tenant until at\nleast 12 months after the water mitigation is completed and tenant\nimprovements are done,\u201d Roccaforte said.\n\nIn the meantime, the spaces are being used for short-term pop-up stores.\n\nSigns alert riders to the wet floor on the platform of Chinatown's Rose Park Station. | Source: Estefany Gonzalez/The Standard\n\n## 'Hydrological puzzle'\n\nDaily weekday ridership for the T Third averaged about 14,300 in 2023, way\nbelow the 43,000 riders SFMTA expects by 2030. (Last month it had 17,300\nweekday ridership.) Also last year, the Chinatown-Rose Pak Station averages\n1,250 daily weekday entries, the Union Square/Market Street station gets 1,110\nand the Yerba Buena/Moscone Station gets just 350. Plugging the leaks for this\nsmall group of passengers will cost millions.\n\nThe SFMTA\u2019s Transportation Capital Committee budgeted $7 million for the\nsubway leaks and expects to spend $4.5 million on Chinatown-Rose Pak Station.\n\n\u201cWe will present the water mitigation contract to the SFMTA Board of Directors\nonce it is ready to be issued and repairs are anticipated to take six months,\u201d\nRoccaforte said. \u201cImprovements and repairs for the Central Subway are being\npaid for by the SFMTA using local sources, with federal funding running out a\nfew years ago.\u201d\n\nThe subway was largely funded by the Federal Transit Administration, whose\nregional office is working with SFMTA on all administrative requirements to\nclose out the grants for the project, according to a FTA spokesperson.\n\nThe agency is working with Gall Zeidler on the water mitigation plan \"as part\nof the remaining repairs and improvements for the Central Subway,\" Roccaforte\nsaid. \"We\u2019re working with them because of their experience and expertise, as\nthis specific issue requires some specialization since the leaks are not at a\nfixed location.\"\n\nAaron Peskin, president of the Board of Supervisors who represents Chinatown,\nsaid he\u2019s been keeping tabs on the leaks since before the line even opened.\n\n\u201cThey have dealt with some of the problem, but not all of the problem,\u201d Peskin\nsaid. \u201cIt's a complex hydrological puzzle to solve, and they're working on it.\nBut it obviously comes with unfortunate impacts\u2014including the impacts to the\nleaseholders.\n\n\u201cIt's not free,\u201d Peskin added. \u201cIt comes with expenses and part of the cost of\nrunning the new subway.\u201d\n\nUpdate: The ridership figures for the T-Third Street light rail line have been\nupdated\n\nAlex Mullaney can be reached at amullaney@sfstandard.com\n\n## Filed Under\n\nCentral SubwayChinatownNewsSan Francisco Municipal Transportation\nAgencyTransportation\n\n## Read More\n\n  * ### Why drivers risk tickets instead of parking in their garages\n\nThe Standard investigated why so many San Franciscans with garages still park\nin their driveway, blocking the sidewalk with their cars.\n\n  * ### Oakland just changed its airport name.
