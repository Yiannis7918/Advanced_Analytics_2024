(Greg Johnson,\nCowboy State Daily)\n\nDevelopers of wind and solar projects in Wyoming are about to get a jolt of\neconomic benefits from a new federal rule issued Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, mining, oil and gas interests are having a difficult time digesting\nthe clean-power agenda outlined in a new renewable energy rule that they say\ncreates an uneven playing field.\n\nOn Thursday, the Biden administration announced an updated regulation to\nincentivize and expedite wind and solar energy development on \u201cidentified\npriority areas\u201d located on public lands.\n\nThe new regulation is designed to help the administration achieve its goal of\ncreating a pollution-free power sector by 2035.\n\nIn announcing the change, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland said that\nthe administration is well ahead of its clean power goals, having permitted\nmore than 25 gigawatts of alternative energy projects.\n\n## Wyoming Project\n\nOf 45 renewable energy projects that have been approved since January 2021 on\npublic land managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, one is located in\nWyoming, according to a BLM statement provided to Cowboy State Daily.\n\nThat project is the 590-megawatt Rock Creek wind project located about 25\nmiles north of Laramie between Rock River and Interstate 80. It straddles\n37,000 acres in Albany County and 6,000 acres in Carbon County.\n\nThe project is sponsored by Chicago-based Invenergy Services LLC, which in\nrecent years has attracted a $4 billion investment from Blackstone Inc., the\nworld\u2019s largest alternative asset investor.\n\nThe 25 gigawatts of renewable clean energy projects is enough to electrify\nmore than 12 million homes and surpasses a milestone set originally for 2025.\n\nAs for Wyoming, the new regulation could incentivize clean power development\non 18.4 million acres of BLM land.\n\nThat\u2019s just under 8% of BLM\u2019s total 245 million acres of land in a dozen\nWestern states.\n\nThe rule has its cheerleaders.\n\n\u201cAs the U.S. accelerates its transition to clean energy, it\u2019s important to\nrecognize that there are areas where it makes sense to incentivize the rapid\nand extensive development of renewable energy and areas where it doesn\u2019t,\u201d\nsaid Rachael Hamby, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities in\nDenver.\n\n\u201cIn areas that have already been identified and prioritized as most suitable\nfor renewable energy development, this will streamline the leasing process and\nhelp develop renewable energy capacity more quickly,\u201d Hamby said.\n\n## Uneven Playing Field\n\nMining and oil and gas interests in Wyoming that extract energy from the BLM\nland aren\u2019t happy with the uneven playing field.\n\n\u201cWhile utility operators continue to sound the alarm on the president\u2019s hasty\nand foolish forced transition to unreliable energy sources, the Biden\nadministration continues its blind march toward further destabilizing the\nAmerican electric grid to appease its puppet masters in the radical\nenvironmental movement,\u201d said Travis Deti, executive director for the Wyoming\nMining Association.\n\n\u201cThis latest in a long line of anti-fossil fuel measures picks winners and\nlosers, throws out the concept of multiple use of federal lands, and will\ndrive up energy costs on Americans while further eroding reliability and\ndispatchability,\u201d he said. \u201cThe country is being sacrificed on the altar of\nthe climate cult.\u201d\n\nThe Petroleum Association of Wyoming (PAW) also finds the new renewable energy\nrule difficult to swallow.\n\nIn summary, PAW noted that the rule adjusts acreage rents and capacity fees\nfor solar and wind energy projects, provides BLM staff with more flexibility\nwhen processing applications for solar and wind energy development inside\ndesignated leasing areas, updates agency criteria on prioritizing solar and\nwind applications, and makes various other technical changes and\nclarifications to BLM\u2019s existing (rights of way) regulations.\n\nThese favorable changes contrast sharply with the substantial additional\nburdens contained in BLM\u2019s proposed revisions to its federal oil and gas\nprogram, which would revise BLM\u2019s oil and natural gas leasing regulations,\nexplained Ryan McConnaughey, vice president of the Petroleum Association of\nWyoming.\n\n\u201cThe rule would alter basic principles of federal land management, create an\nunlevel playing field among energy sources on federal lands, and potentially\nrestrict access for oil and natural gas development in some areas for decades\nto come,\u201d he said.\n\n## Increasing Footprint In Wyoming\n\nIn recent years, Wyomingites have seen billions of dollars of wind and solar\nprojects sprout up on the prairies and vast landscape of the Cowboy State \u2014\nespecially concentrated in the wind alleys of Albany, Carbon and Converse\ncounties.\n\nThe updated regulation issued Thursday is called the \u201crenewable energy rule,\u201d\nwhich largely reduces rents and fees for BLM land by about 80% compared to\nthose in place prior to guidance given just two years ago.\n\nThe rule implements part of the Energy Policy Act of 2020 that authorized BLM\nto reduce rents and fees for wind and solar development on public lands.\n\nThe renewable energy rule also allows the BLM to accept wind and solar lease\napplications in priority areas without holding a competitive auction if doing\nso is in the public interest.\n\nAccording to WindExchange, more than 3,286 megawatts of wind-producing\nturbines have been built in the Cowboy State, everywhere from areas along\nInterstate 80 in southern Wyoming, to large fields near Douglas in Converse\nCounty off of the I-25 corridor.\n\nAnother 3,503 megawatts in wind power are in various stages of planning or\nconstruction.\n\nBesides coal-fired power plants, which make up about 72.6% of the electric\ngrid mix in Wyoming, wind makes up the next largest category at 22.4%,\nfollowed by 2.35% for natural gas, 2% for hydro and less than 1% for solar and\noil, according to WindExchange.\n\nThose percentages will dramatically shift in coming years as some coal-fired\nplants convert to gas, and some small nuclear plants begin to emerge in\nWyoming.\n\nPat Maio can be reached at pat@cowboystatedaily.com.\n\n## In case you missed it\n\n### Cowboy State Daily Video News: Friday, April
