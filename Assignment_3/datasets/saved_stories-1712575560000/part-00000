That\u2019s because Wu didn\u2019t\nhave to stop and wait for his battery to charge \u2014 he stopped at a battery\nswapping station.\n\nInstead of parking next to a row of charging stations, he drove into a modern,\ngarage-like structure and pressed a button on his dashboard. After he backed\nhis vehicle onto an elevated platform, a mechanical arm extended to remove the\noriginal battery from the bottom of the car and install a new battery, as\nstaff looked on for quality assurance. The automated process was complete in\njust five minutes.\n\n\u201cI am happy that I don\u2019t have to wait for hours on the roadside like a lot of\nother EV owners,\u201d Wu told Rest of World. Wu\u2019s Nio ES6 is one of a few models\nfrom the brand that specifically support battery swapping; it\u2019s not something\nthat can be done with just any EV. \u201cIt was even faster than topping up at a\n[traditional] gas station.\u201d\n\nBattery swapping is rarely seen globally because it requires both specialized\nEVs that support the feature and a network of swapping stations. But it has\nfound a strong foothold in China. By the end of 2023, the total number of\nbattery swapping stations in China reached 3,567, of which 2,333 were operated\nby Nio. The International Energy Agency hailed China a \u201cleader in global\nbattery swapping infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe technology was originally pioneered in 2008 by Better Place, a San\nFrancisco\u2013based company operating in Israel that aimed to lower EV prices\nworldwide; the system didn\u2019t take off in Israel because of financial\ndifficulties caused by the high investment required to develop battery\nswapping infrastructure.\n\nChinese EV makers are banking on a different outcome. Home to almost half the\nglobe\u2019s electric vehicles, China has 85% of the world\u2019s fast chargers and 65%\nof slow chargers, leading the globe in EV infrastructure. Yet, battery life\nand access to charging stations remain the biggest barriers for Chinese\nconsumers considering the switch from internal combustion engine (ICE)\nvehicles to EVs, according to a survey by J.D. Power.\n\nChinese EV owners queue for well over an hour for a charging station during\nholidays and then wait another average 50 minutes for the vehicle to charge,\naccording to a 2023 report by the China Electric Vehicle Charging\nInfrastructure Promotion Alliance (EVCIPA). On busy days, long queues form on\nhighways, and 70% of surveyed Chinese EV owners reported dissatisfaction with\nwaiting times. In rural regions, charging stations are scarce or simply out of\nservice.\n\n> 3,567 The total number of battery swapping stations in China by the end of\n> 2023.\n>\n> Nio\n\nThe earliest users of battery swap stations in China, namely Nio owners, tell\nRest of World that the service has already dramatically improved their\nexperiences, especially when traveling longer distances. Now, they simply\ndrive up to battery swap stations and trade their drained batteries for fully\ncharged ones.\n\nThis solution could address a major pain point for both consumers and\ncommercial fleets and inspire international counterparts, said Bill Russo,\nfounder and CEO of EV consulting firm Automobility. \u201cThe world is walking to\nthe future, whereas China is racing,\u201d Russo told Rest of World.\n\nWu is one of the hundreds of thousands of owners of an EV made by Nio, a local\ncompetitor of Tesla in China, which is hoping to stand out from competitors by\nproviding superior customer service. Another customer, James Zhang, a Nio EV\nowner in Shanghai, told Rest of World that the ease of battery swapping was\none of the main reasons he chose the brand over other competitors.\n\n> \u201cIt was even faster than topping up at a [traditional] gas station.\u201d\n\nWhen buying a Nio vehicle, customers can choose to own a battery or simply\nsubscribe to a battery rental service (BaaS) at 12,720 yuan ($1,760) per year.\nIf the customer chooses to not own a battery, the purchase price could drop by\nas much as 70,000 yuan ($9,687). Each battery swap costs 80\u2013100 yuan\n($11\u2013$13.8).\n\nA failing or damaged battery is also one of the top reasons EV owners choose\nto trade in their cars. \u201cBesides shorter charging time, battery swapping would\nde-risk battery obsolescence, allowing users to swap for upgraded batteries as\ntechnology advances,\u201d said Russo.\n\nK. Z\u00e9 Liu, a research analyst at World Resources Institute, pointed out that\nwith the battery swap model, EV owners don\u2019t need to pay for new batteries,\nwhich are the most expensive component of a new energy vehicle. \u201cThis reduces\nthe cost of cars and is very attractive for commercial fleet companies. They\ncan buy cars in bulk at a lower cost and then lease batteries, which\nsignificantly reduces their operating costs,\u201d Liu told Rest of World.\n\nFollowing Nio\u2019s lead, prominent players in the EV sector are joining the\nbattery swapping trend. On January 28, battery manufacturer Contemporary\nAmperex Technology (CATL) and ride-hailing behemoth Didi announced their\ncollaboration to launch a new battery swapping venture. The partnership aims\nto develop battery swap stations for commercial fleets in ride-hailing\nbusinesses.\n\nHowever, the future of battery swapping hinges on industry-wide standards to\nensure cross-brand battery compatibility. In 2021, China\u2019s EV main regulatory\nbody, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, published a safety\nstandard for battery swap stations. In June 2023, Xin Guobin, the vice\nminister of the ministry, announced that China is going to push toward a\nuniversal standard of battery size, connection points, and protocols to\nfacilitate the growth of battery swapping.\n\nNio has already formed a battery swapping partnership with brands including\nGeely, Changan, Jianghuai Automobile (JAC), and Chery. The companies announced\nthat they will work together to standardize battery packs across brands,\ndetermine battery asset management standards, and roll out other measures to\nexpand the EV battery swap ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThe growing interest from various EV manufacturers is promising, signaling a\npotential for industry-wide scalability. The adoption of a universal battery\nstandard is essential for cross-brand compatibility,\u201d Alexander Li, a battery\nengineer and co-founder of the U.S. China Climate Forum, told Rest of World.\n\nNio vehicle customers can choose to own a battery or subscribe to a battery\nrental service.

The cost of building each second-generation power swap station for\nNio is a minimum of 1.5 million yuan ($207,581), higher than most small-to-\nmedium-scale charging stations. A fast charging station can cost as little as\n100,000 yuan ($13,838), while a slow public charging point costs as little as\n10,000 yuan ($1,383).\n\nNio is yet to be profitable and reported a $2.9 billion loss in 2023, adding\nto the company\u2019s existing deficit of over $2 billion. Outside of China, Nio\nhas built only 30 battery swap stations across Europe, in Denmark, Germany,\nNorway, the Netherlands, and Spain. With only a handful of stations in each\ncountry, it is unlikely that the service will attract users, analysts say.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see Nio\u2019s battery swap stations taking off in Europe anytime soon\nbecause it\u2019s one of those things that only works at scale,\u201d Liu, the analyst\nat World Resources Institute, told Rest of World. \u201cIt\u2019s a chicken-and-egg\nproblem \u2014 there are not enough cars that support battery swapping, not to\nmention Scandinavian countries like Norway already have the best charging\ninfrastructure globally. Without policy support from the EU, Nio\u2019s push in\nEurope is going to be very difficult, and battery swap is likely to remain\nvery niche.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThe world is walking to the future, whereas China is racing.\u201d\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Nio sold 200 and 1,350 cars in Europe respectively. In the\nfirst half of 2023, Nio reported that it sold 832 cars in Europe. While the\nnumber is increasing every year, Nio\u2019s market share remains low, only about\n0.1%.\n\nBut China remains the place where this vision of a green, swap-friendly future\nis closest to being realized. \u201cIn China, there\u2019s a lot of [governmental]\nsupport on financing, but the U.S. government initiative has mostly favored\ntrucks, none in the smaller vehicle space,\u201d Baruch Herzfeld, founder of New\nYork City\u2013based e-bike battery swapping company Popwheels, told Rest of World.\n\u201cI believe the future of mobility in America is a smaller vehicle, a personal\nvehicle with a swappable battery, but it will not happen in the U.S. without\nsubstantial investment. There simply isn\u2019t a network of manufacturers,\nsuppliers, and financers for it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSetting up battery stations is an extremely costly undertaking,\u201d Jason Hong,\nU.S. general manager of battery company Ruipulan Jun Energy (REPT) Battero,\ntold Rest of World, \u201cbut an industry-wide standardization, if achieved, could\nreduce overall cost to keep these stations running in the long run in China.\u201d\n\nCaiwei Chen is a Rest of World reporter based in New York.\n\nAdditional reporting by Anthony Mei.\n\nRead more stories\n\nEV Revolution\n\nLas compa\u00f1\u00edas de autos el\u00e9ctricos quieren el litio de Argentina.
