In many cases the cable installation is pre-existing and uses\nlow cost RG-59 cable but this cable is limited to low frequency use (Existing\nmethods to transmit HD video include separate analogue RGB/YPbPr, which\nrequires three coaxial cables to transmit, or HD-SDI (and its derivative HD-\nCCTV), a serial digital transmission method which runs at a bit rate of\n1.485MHz and can only achieve small distances with such cable.\n\nWhilst analogue cable equalizers are available from some semiconductor\nmanufacturers (e.g., Analog Devices and Intersil), they still require the\ntransmission of three components (e.g., YPbPr) which involves the re-\ninstallation of additional cables, which can add considerably to the total\nsystem cost of a security installation.\n\nOther methods, such as compression of the video prior to transmission, (the IP\ncamera), add considerable cost and power budget to each camera as well as\nlimiting options in the post-processing of the image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this article we will discuss a method of transmitting HD video across this\nmedium using a modified form of the well-known NTSC analogue composite video\nstandard to create the signal for transmission: we have christened the method\nHD-CVI, for High Definition Composite Video Interface.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPartner Content\n\nAMD-Powered Advantech AIMB-723 Industrial Motherboard Future-Proofs AOI\nDeployments\n\n04.09.2024\n\nNuvoton drives the EV market with its cutting-edge battery monitoring chipset\nsolution\n\n04.03.2024\n\nImproved Power Efficiency and AI Inference in Autonomous Systems\n\n03.26.2024\n\nDistances of greater than 300m are achievable and in excess of 500m at\n720p/60Hz with some small signal degradation. As with most analogue\ntransmission methods, the signal degradation is 'graceful' with no sudden cut-\noff of the signal that is encountered with digital methods. HD-CVI is\ncompatible with most HD video standards and also non-standard video, (e.g.,\nfrom HD-CCD cameras).\n\nHD-CVI is also backward compatible to standard definition NTSC/PAL\ntransmissions whilst also offering a considerable transmission distance\nincrease.\n\nHD-CVI is also designed to support a back channel allowing control information\nto be embedded in the vertical blanking interval for information transfer\nbetween the receiver/transmitter; for example to control camera functions, and\nbetween the transmitter/receiver for embedding information about the\ntransmitter signal source, standard or the camera environment. The back\nchannel also permits automatic cable equalization.\n\nRG-59 Cable Specification Exact specifications vary across cable providers but\nan average of these will show an attenuation of approximately 2.4dB/100ft at\n50MHz and 3.5dB/100ft at 100MHz, the frequency range of interest to us;\n(7.8db/100m and 11.5dB/100m respectively).\n\nThese figures do not take into account cable installation issues or other\nissues such as hum pickup. The HD-CVI interface has some degree of hum\nrejection through its pseudo-differential receiver input stage.\n\nFor the target distance specification of 300m and at the highest transmitted\nfrequency (for 720p/60Hz = 73MHz) we are therefore required to accommodate\napproximately 3dB/100ft, (9.8dB/100m), or 29.5dB of loss.\n\nThe loss at 100kHz for a 300m cable run is 0.9dB.\n\nA typical cable specification is shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: Typical RG-59 Cable Specification from Hosiwell Technology Co. Ltd.\nAt 1GHz the attenuation of 30dB/100m makes it totally unsuitable for\ntransmitting HD-SDI at 1.485GHz.\n\nHD-CVI Technical Overview The following is a brief overview of the HD-CVI\ninterface for the transmission of 720p/60Hz HD video. The parameters may be\naltered to adapt to other resolution requirements.\n\nThe basic concept of the HD-CVI interface is to build on the proven and\nreliable transport method of NTSC; (the advantages of PAL \u2013 v.v. multi-path\nreception \u2013 is not relevant to a cable system so the simpler NTSC standard is\nused as the model). NTSC transmissions are capable of being transmitted over\nmore than 1km across RG-59 cable but the bandwidth is limited to 5MHz. NTSC\nalso has chroma/luma crosstalk issues because of the interleaved nature of the\nsignal that are difficult to resolve at the receiver end.\n\nBecause the cable system is a closed system it is only necessary for the\ntransmitter and receiver to 'understand' each other and we can modify the\nbasic NTSC method to suit HD transmissions.\n\nThe first thing to overcome is the bandwidth restrictions of the cable. HD\n720p/60Hz transmission requires a luma bandwidth of 30MHz. Because we have\nonly a single coaxial cable for the transport we have chosen to transmit luma\nand colour difference signals, (as opposed to component red, green blue), as\nthe colour difference signals, because of the visual perception of the eye\nbeing less acute to colour, can be sent at half the bandwidth: i.e., 15MHz\neach. This is in accordance to the SMPTE-296M specification.\n\nTo further reduce the bandwidth of the transmission the colour difference\nsignals are modulated onto a carrier in quadrature so they effectively use the\nsame bandwidth. However, to avoid the signal recovery problems of NTSC, (and\nas we have no backward compatibility issues), the carrier is set above the\nluma bandwidth so there is no interference between the two signals.\n\nFor 720p/60Hz transmission the carrier is at 58.559489MHz which ensures there\nis no beating with the horizontal or vertical scan frequencies; (the line\nfrequency/carrier phase relationship of NTSC does not have to be adhered to\nbecause the chroma and luma are not interleaved). The carrier frequency is\nsuitably far above the luma maximum frequency to allow inexpensive (in terms\nof silicon area) filters to be used in the transmitter and receiver.\n\nThe effective bandwidth of the complete signal is therefore approximately\n15MHz + 58.6MHz or about 73MHz. This also sets the minimum sampling frequency\nat 2x 73MHz or 146MHz. For convenience we choose 148.5MHz as this is related\nto the 720p/60 SMPTE standard.\n\nFor 300m of RG-59 cable we can expect a 30dB loss at this frequency. However\nthe synchronizing signals are at a much lower frequency where the loss is only\nabout 1-2dB so reliable rastering of the received signal should always be\nassured.\n\nTo improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the transmission pre-emphasis is\nused. The degree of pre-emphasis is programmable to allow for different cable\nlengths. The maximum pre-emphasis is set at 30dB for our evaluation and the\nfrequency response is set to approximate the RG-59 cable loss.\n\nA further improvement in the SNR is achieved through transmitting a peak to\npeak video level of 2V which maintains compatibility with any legacy SD\nequipment on the network and also allows common low-power 5V drivers to be\nused.\n\nBeyond 300m the bandwidth will start to further fall off. The chroma signal\nwill be the first affected by this being the highest-frequency component.\nHowever automatic colour control in the receiver can maintain the colour\nsaturation over a further 20dB signal attenuation (to approximately 500m).\n\nFall off in the luma bandwidth can be compensated by a small boost in the\nreceiver circuit. At extreme distances the signal will revert to monochrome as\nthe chroma signal falls below the receiver's range of compensation but\nsynchronizing signals should be able to be received at greater than 1km\ndistance. The luma bandwidth will be 'gracefully' reduced as the distance is\nincreased.\n\nBecause of the similarity in the transmission method to NTSC both the\ntransmitter and receiver can easily be made to accommodate conventional\nNTSC/PAL transmissions.\n\nThe HD-CVI Encoder The following is a detailed description of the HD-CVI\nencoder (see Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2: HD-CVI Transmitter Block Diagram. In this example the input is\nSMPTE-296M (720p/60Hz) component video at 74MHz. The output HD-CVI video at\n148MHz can be transmitted across >300m of RG-59 cable with almost no\ndegradation.\n\nThere are two clock inputs to the HD-CVI encoder, 74.25MHz (the SMPTE sampling\nfrequency for the luma channel) and 148.5MHz. The 74MHz clock is used for the\ninput data clocking and the 148MHz clock is used for the output clock timing.\nAn additional enable is used for the Cb/Cr signals, (at 37.125MHz).\n\nIn addition two synchronizing inputs are required, HSync for the horizontal\nline input (45kHz) and VSync for the frame input (60Hz). From these inputs we\ncreate a composite sync pulse which complies with the SMPTE timing.\n\nThe HD-CVI sync waveform uses conventional syncs rather than tri-level syncs\nand with slower rise and fall times which helps to prevent ringing of the sync\npulse edges with long cable runs and aid sync recovery. The rise and fall\nwaveforms approximate a raised cosine shape over a period of 28 clocks. The\nshaped composite sync is then scaled and an offset added to avoid the negative\nclipping in the output amplifier.\n\nThe 10-bit luma data is scaled and added to the analogue composite sync\noutput. The composite sync + luma signal is then interpolated from 74.25MHz to\n148MHz in a 49-tap FIR filter. The filter has a pass-band of 30MHz and a stop\nband attenuation of > -50dB at 37MHz. The filter response is shown in Figure\n3.\n\nFigure 3: Luma Interpolator Filter response. The filter is flat to 30MHz\nallowing transmission of the full SMPTE specification luma bandwidth yet fully\nrejecting the chroma component ensuring no cross-colour effects.\n\nThe 10 bit B-Y and R-Y data is first scaled using the NTSC scaling parameters.\nThe scaled U and V signals are then interpolated from 37.125MHz to 148MHz in a\n63 tap FIR filter. The filter has a pass-band of 15MHz and a stop band\nattenuation of > -50dB at 20MHz. The filter response is shown in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4: Chroma Interpolator Filter Response. The 15MHz chroma bandwidth\ncomplies with the SMPTE-296M specification. By separating the luma and chroma\nchannels we ensure there is no crosstalk and simplify the decoder design.\n\nThe subcarrier frequency used to modulate the chroma is generated using a 32\nbit ratio counter clocked from the 148.5MHz clock.\n\nThe top 11 bits of this ratio counter (the phase word) are used by the\ndemodulator to generate the sine and cosine waveforms.\n\nThe lower frequency of the luma filter cutoff is 37MHz and the cutoff\nfrequency of the chroma filter is 20MHz. The minimum value for the subcarrier\nfrequency to avoid crosstalk is therefore 57MHz. The subcarrier chosen for the\n720p/60Hz standard is 58.559489MHz which ensures a small gap between chroma\nand luma and is also chosen to ensure there are no multiples of the horizontal\nor vertical scan frequencies which could cause beating effects.\n\nThe subcarrier phase word is used to address a ROM containing sine and cosine\nvalues. A sample of the sine waveform is added, after shaping, to the back\nporch of the video signal to synchronise the chroma demodulator of the\nreceiver to provide an amplitude and phase reference to the receiver. This\ncolour burst is blanked during the field pulse.\n\nThe sine and cosine values are multiplied, in turn, by the B-Y and R-Y. The\nresulting U.sin(2\u03c0F_sc .t) and V.cos(2\u03c0F_sc .t) data is added together to form\nthe final chroma signal.\n\nThis chroma output is then passed through a notch filter centred on the\nsubcarrier frequency. The notch ensures no harmonics generated by the\nmodulator can interfere with the luma component. The response of the notch\nfilter is shown in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5: The chroma modulator notch filter frequency response. This filter\nmay prove unnecessary in the final evaluation but is designed to prevent any\nartifacts from the modulation process causing crosstalk in the luma channel.\n\nThe colour burst, chroma and luma with composite sync are added to create the\ncomplete HD-CVI output waveform. This waveform is then subjected to a variable\ndegree of pre-emphasis with a maximum boost of +30dB at >50MHz. The pre-\nemphasis filter is a 5 tap FIR.\n\nThe degree of pre-emphasis is dependent on the cable length and is designed to\napproximately compensate for the loss of 300m of RG-59 cable. The response of\nthe pre-emphasis filter is shown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6: The transmitter pre-emphasis filter frequency response. This filter\napproximates the high frequency attenuation of the coaxial cable and its\neffect is programmable depending on the length of the cable installation.\n\nAnalogue considerations The 10-bit HD-CVI output from the pre-emphasis filter\ndrives a high-speed DAC, an Analog Devices (ADI) AD9705 for the evaluation\nplatform.\n\nThe 1-volt nominal pk-pk output from the DAC differentially drives an ADI\nAD8051 high-speed amplifier. This amplifier is set for a gain of x4 giving a\npeak-to-peak output of 4V which is then AC coupled into the cable via a 75\u03a9\nseries termination. The AD8051 has a high current drive capability allowing it\nto fully swing the 4V into a 150\u03a9 termination.\n\nThe output BNC is effectively floating although coupled to ground at high\nfrequencies. This allows a pseudo-differential mode for the received vertical\ninterval data (used, for example, for camera control).\n\nAt full pre-emphasis gain the sync outputs will be approximately 65mV pk-pk\nand about 1dB less than this at the receiving end after 300m of cable loss.\nFrequencies above 50MHz, subject to full pre-emphasis gain will be -30dB after\n300m of cable or approximately 63mV pk-pk so for a typical installation our\nreceived frequency response will be essentially flat.\n\nThe HD-CVI input is AC coupled into a differential amplifier. The input is\npseudo-differential at low frequencies which affords some hum rejection. The\ngain of this stage is -6dB; (ADI AD4830 amplifier \u2013 this amplifier also has\ninput clamping to stop any electrical interference pickup destroying the front\nend).\n\nThe output from the input receiver is DC coupled into a voltage controlled\namplifier, (ADI AD8337), which is able to apply up to +30dB of gain,\nsufficient for this evaluation. Another amplifier, or a cascaded design of\nthis one, could be used for longer cable installations where more gain is\nrequired.\n\nThe output from this amplifier is then at a nominal amplitude for driving the\nADC. This output is black level clamped using an analogue switch, the black\nlevel being clamped to 2.8V which is the operating point of the selected ADC\nanalogue inputs.\n\nThe clamped signal is then buffered and provides the single ended drive into\nthe ADC inputs. The ADC used for the evaluation is the ADI AD9430 (170MHz\nversion).\n\nThe ADC is sampled at 148.5MHz. The output from the ADC is straight binary at\n12 bits. Although 12 bits was used for the evaluation platform, a lower-cost\n10-bit ADC is expected to perform satisfactorily. Experiments are also being\nperformed on dual ADCs, (sub-100MHz sample rates), operating them 180 degrees\nout of phase, as the dual ADCs are considerably lower cost than the single\nhigh-speed ADC.\n\nHD-CVI Decoder The following is a description of the HD-CVI decoder, (see\nFigure 7).\n\nFigure 7: HD-CVI Decoder Block Diagram. Because the chroma is modulated onto a\ncarrier above the luma signal there is no crosstalk and the decoder is\nconsiderably less complicated than a conventional NTSC video decoder with comb\nfilter.\n\nThe HD-CVI input from the ADC is a straight binary, 12-bit input sampled at\n148.5MHz. Analogue clamping prior to the ADC ensures the black level of the\nsignal is at the midpoint of the ADC code, below that is sync, above that is\nvideo. There is no pedestal on the transmission.\n\nThe HD-CVI input is first low pass filtered to remove the chroma component.\nThe filter is the same 49-tap FIR used in the transmitter, (see Figure 3). As\nthe stop band of this filter is 37MHz we can decimate the output of the filter\nto 74.25MHz clock frequency.\n\nA fixed offset is subtracted from the low-pass-filtered luma video such that\nthe midpoint of the sync pulse is at value 0. Values 1-32 from the horizontal\npixel counter address a look up table whose output coefficients form a FIR low\npass filter to further reduce noise and subcarrier from the composite video.\nThe coefficients are multiplied by the offset video and accumulated across the\n32 samples, effectively being updated once per horizontal line. When the\nmidpoint of the falling edge of the horizontal pulse is coincident with the\nmidpoint of the FIR filter the accumulated result will be zero. When they are\nnot coincident an error will be generated.\n\nThis error is filtered using a recursive filter (integrator) and proportional\nand integral terms are added to create an error word which is used to control\na pulse width modulator output, which via a low pass filter produces an\nanalogue control voltage to a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). The\nresulting clock output from the VCO is the nominal 148.5MHz clock into the\nreceiver module.\n\nThe horizontal pixel counter is used by the SPG (sync pulse generator) to\nprovide the horizontal timing pulses required by the decoder, including the\nblack level clamp pulse to the analogue front end and the burst gate pulse for\nthe demodulator.\n\nThe vertical field pulses are recovered by using a digital integrator on the\nsliced composite video.\n\nA free-running subcarrier frequency is generated using the same method\nemployed in the transmitter. The free-running frequency of the subcarrier is\n58.559489MHz. The top 11 bits of this ratio counter (the phase word) are used\nby the demodulator to generate the sine and cosine waveforms.\n\nFor the demodulation to correctly operate the generated subcarrier must be\nfrequency and phase locked to the HD-CVI video subcarrier which is done by\nmeasuring the amplitude of the demodulated and low pass filtered V output\nduring the colour burst. If the frequency and phase of the free-running\nsubcarrier and the colour burst are the same then this error will be zero. 32\nsamples of the V output waveform are taken during the burst pulse; the burst\ngate pulse from the SPG being used for this purpose. The seed word is then\nmodified using the phase error signal until the input colour burst and the\nratio counter are phase locked.\n\nThe HD-CVI chroma signal is originally generated as follows:\n\nchroma = U sin(\u03c9t) + V cos(\u03c9t)\n\nWhen the burst lock loop (BLO) is in lock, the frequency and phase will be the\nsame as when the signal was being modulated. Thus, multiplying the HD-CVI\ncomposite video by the sine and cosine of the same frequency and phase gives\nthe following:\n\nand for the V component:\n\nThe reconstructed sine and cosine waveforms are multiplied by the input\n148.5MHz free-running composite video. The output of the sine channel is the\ndemodulated U signal and the cosine channel is the demodulated V output.\n\nThe output of the demodulator also comprises twice subcarrier frequencies. The\noutput is therefore low-pass filtered using a 63-tap filter, the response for\nwhich is shown in Figure 4. The output of the filter is the clean 'simple'\ndemodulated U and V.\n\nThe low pass filtered luma is conditioned by the processing amplifier. First\nthe black level offset is subtracted from the luma signal to set the black\nlevel at zero. The luma is then amplified to provide a 960 code (10 bit)\noutput for a 100% white input. The luma output is sampled at 74.25MHz.\n\nThe low-pass-filtered chroma outputs are amplified separately to provide a\nnominal 700mV output for a 100% colour bar input. These outputs are valid on\nthe rising edge of the 74MHz clock when the Cmux (37MHz) enable signal is\nhigh.\n\nThe SPG also provides Vout (vertical) and Hout (horizontal) synchronizing\noutputs which can be used for later processing blocks or for a digital to\nanalogue converter.\n\nHD-CVI Evaluation Platform An evaluation platform for the HD-CVI interface has\nbeen developed to prove the concept. A small transmitter and receiver module\nhave been developed and the encoder and decoder have been written in Verilog\nand compiled for an Altera Cyclone III FPGA (EP3C25).\n\nThe interface has proven reliable over 300m of RG-59 cable with a frequency\nresponse to 30MHz \u00b10.2dB being achieved.\n\nFigure 8: This is a screen capture of the output of the HD-CVI receiver. It\nshows a 30MHz sweep waveform after transmission across 300m of RG-59 cable.\n\nFurther work is proceeding on lowering the BOM cost, increasing the cable\ndistance and transmitting 1080p/60Hz video.\n\nConclusion I would be the first to complain against the proliferation of\nunnecessary standards or worse, the abuse of existing standards.\n\nHowever, the increasing use of HD video cameras in the surveillance market has\ncreated a problem for the transmission of the same standards.\n\nA large number of buildings have already been cabled for security, but using\nRG-59 cable with the expectation those cameras would be standard definition\nand existing methods of transmitting the video uncompressed are not compatible\nwith these installations. Even for future installations either multiple cables\nor more expensive cable/repeaters will be required for the transmission of HD\nvideo, adding considerably to the cost of the installation.\n\nThe interface described above allows the transmission of HD video using RG-59\ncable over distances of greater than 300m with very little degradation. The\ntransmitter adds minimal cost overhead to the camera whilst the receiver up\ncost is expected to be comparable to adding HD-SDI. These costs could of\ncourse be mitigated by the development of an ASIC.\n\nAbout the author Daniel Ogilvie is Technical Director of SingMai Electronics\nand has been involved with electronics, both at an amateur and professional\nlevel, since he was sixteen.
