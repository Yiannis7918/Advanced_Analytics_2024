But the business impact of this month\u2019s total solar eclipse, which\nstarts over the Pacific Ocean, cuts a path across North America and ends in\nthe Atlantic, is already plain to see. According to Jamie Lane of AirDNA, a\ntravel-data firm, on a typical Sunday night in April around 30% of homes\nlisted for short-term rental on Airbnb or Vrbo in areas in or around the\neclipse\u2019s path are occupied. A remarkable 92% of listings within the zone of\ntotality have been booked for April 7th. Demand for homes just a few towns\noutside this roughly 180km-wide strip has barely changed.\n\nThe eclipse will be visible from a handful of big or biggish cities, including\nDallas, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Buffalo and Montreal. CoStar, a hotel-data\nprovider, reckons that occupancy rates in those places are up anywhere from 12\npercentage points (in Montreal) to 67 (in Indianapolis). The remaining rooms\nappear to be available only at elevated prices. The New York Times reports\nthat nearly half of Super 8 motels in the eclipse\u2019s path with rooms still\navailable are charging at least twice the standard rate.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get the full story\n\n### Enjoy a month of insightful analysis for free.
