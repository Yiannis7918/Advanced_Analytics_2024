(AP Photo/Dake Kang)\n\nBy DIDI TANG and DAKE KANG\n\nUpdated 11:43 AM UTC, April 13, 2024\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n\nLink copied\n\n  * Email\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * X\n\n  * Reddit\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Pinterest\n\n  * Flipboard\n\n  * Print\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Stephen Garrett, a 27-year-old graduate student, always\nthought he would study in China, but first the country\u2019s restrictive COVID-19\npolicies made it nearly impossible and now he has other concerns.\n\nThe cost is one deterrent, but Garrett is more worried about restrictions on\nacademic freedom and the personal risk of being stranded in China. He is not\nalone.\n\nThese days, only about 700 American students are studying at Chinese\nuniversities, down from a peak of close to 25,000 a decade ago, while there\nare nearly 300,000 Chinese students at U.S. schools.\n\nSome young Americans are discouraged from investing their time in China by\nwhat they see as diminishing economic opportunities and strained relations\nbetween Washington and Beijing.\n\nWhatever the reason for the imbalance, U.S. officials and scholars bemoan the\nlost opportunities for young people to experience life in China and gain\ninsight into a formidable American adversary.\n\nAnd officials from both countries agree that more should be done to encourage\nthe student exchanges, at a time when Beijing and Washington can hardly agree\non anything else.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nA Chinese official meets North Korean leader Kim in Pyongyang in highest-level\ntalks in years\n\nUS intelligence finding shows China surging equipment sales to Russia to help\nwar effort in Ukraine\n\nUS and Philippines step up strategic partnership as China threats loom in\nSouth China Sea\n\n\u201cI do not believe the environment is as hospitable for educational exchange as\nit was in the past, and I think both sides are going to need to take steps,\u201d\nsaid Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell.\n\nThe U.S. has advised its. citizens to \u201creconsider travel\u201d to China over\nconcerns of arbitrary detentions and widened use of exit bans to bar Americans\nfrom leaving the country. Campbell said this has hindered the rebuilding of\nthe exchanges and easing the advisory is now under \u201cactive consideration.\u201d\n\nFor its part, Beijing is rebuilding programs for international students that\nwere shuttered during the pandemic, and Chinese President Xi Jinping has\ninvited tens of thousands of U.S. high school students to visit.\n\nThe situation was far different after President Barack Obama started the\n100,000 Strong initiative in 2009 to drastically increase the number of U.S.\nstudents studying in China.\n\nBy 2012, there were as many as 24,583 U.S. students in China, according to\ndata by the Chinese education ministry. The Open Doors reports by the\nInstitute of International Education, which only track students enrolled in\nU.S. schools and studying in China for credit, show the number peaked at\n14,887 in the 2011-12 school year. But 10 years later, the number was down to\nonly 211.\n\nIn late 2023, the number of American students stood at 700, according to\nNicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador to China, who said this was far too few in\na country of such importance to the United States.\n\n\u201cWe need young Americans to learn Mandarin. We need young Americans to have an\nexperience of China,\u201d Burns said.\n\nWithout these U.S. students, \u201cin the next decade, we won\u2019t be able to exercise\nsavvy, knowledgeable diplomacy in China,\u201d warned David Moser, an American\nlinguist who went to China in the 1980s and is now tasked with establishing a\nnew master\u2019s program for international students at Beijing Capital Normal\nUniversity.\n\nMoser recalled the years when American students found China fascinating and\nthought an education there could lead to an interesting career. But he said\nthe days of bustling trade and money deals are gone, while American students\nand their parents are watching China and the United States move away from each\nother. \u201cSo people think investment in China as a career is a dumb idea,\u201d Moser\nsaid.\n\nAfter 2012, the number of American students in China dipped but held steady at\nmore than 11,000 for several years, according to Open Doors, until the\npandemic hit, when China closed its borders and kept most foreigners out.\nPrograms for overseas students that took years to build were shuttered, and\nstaff were let go, Moser said.\n\nAmy Gadsden, executive director of China Initiatives at the University of\nPennsylvania, also attributed some of the declining interest to foreign\nbusinesses closing their offices in China. Beijing\u2019s draconian governing\nstyle, laid bare by its response to the pandemic, also has given American\nstudents a pause, she said.\n\nGarrett, a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced\nInternational Studies, or SAIS, had lived in Hong Kong as a teenager and\ninterned in mainland China. He said he\u2019s still interested in traveling to\nChina but not anytime soon, citing the lack of access to information,\nrestrictions on discussions of politically sensitive issues and China\u2019s\nsweeping anti-spying law.\n\nSome American students remain committed to studying in China, said Andrew\nMertha, director of the China Global Research Center at SAIS. \u201cThere are\npeople who are interested in China for China\u2019s sake,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nthose numbers are affected at all.\u201d\n\nAbout 40 U.S. students are now studying at the Hopkins-Nanjing center in the\neastern Chinese city, and the number is expected to go up in the fall to\napproach the pre-pandemic level of 50-60 students, said Adam Webb, the\ncenter\u2019s American co-director.\n\nAmong them is Chris Hankin, 28, who said he believed time in China was\nirreplaceable because he could interact with ordinary people and travel to\nplaces outside the radar of international media. \u201cAs the relationship becomes\nmore intense, it\u2019s important to have that color, to have that granularity,\u201d\nsaid Hankin, a master\u2019s student of international relations with a focus on\nenergy and the environment.\n\nJonathan Zhang, a Chinese American studying at the prestigious Schwarzman\nScholars program at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said it was more important\nthan ever to be in China at a time of tense relations. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to\ntalk about China without being in China,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s truly a shame\nthat so many people have never stepped foot in China.\u201d\n\nZhang was met with concerns when he deferred an offer at a consulting firm to\ngo Beijing. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018oh, be safe,\u2019 or like, \u2018what do you mean, you\u2019re\ngoing back to China?\u2019\u201d Zhang said. \u201cI feel like the (Chinese) government is\ntrying with an earnest effort, but I feel like a lot of this trust has been\nbroken.\u201d\n\nGadsden said U.S. universities need to do more to nudge students to consider\nChina. \u201cWe need to be more intentional about creating the opportunities and\nabout encouraging students to do this deeper work on China, because it\u2019s going\nto be interesting for them, and it\u2019s going to be valuable for the U.S.-China\nrelationship and for the world,\u201d she said.\n\nIn China, Jia Qingguo, a professor of international relations and a national\npolitical adviser, has suggested Beijing clarify its laws involving foreign\nnationals, introduce a separate system for political reviews of foreign\nstudents\u2019 dissertations, and make it easier for foreign graduates to find\ninternships and jobs in Chinese companies.\n\nMeanwhile, China is hosting American high school students under a plan Xi\nunveiled in November to welcome 50,000 in the next five years.\n\nIn January, a group of 24 students from Iowa\u2019s Muscatine High School became\nthe first to travel to China. The all-expenses-paid, nine-day trip took them\nto the Beijing Zoo, Great Wall, Palace Museum, the Yu Garden and Shanghai\nMuseum.\n\nSienna Stonking, one of the Muscatine students, now wants to return to China\nto study.\n\n\u201cIf I had the opportunity, I would love to go to college in China,\u201d she told\nChina\u2019s state broadcaster CGTN. \u201cHonestly, I love it there.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nKang reported from Beijing.\n\nDAKE KANG\n\nKang covers Chinese politics, technology and society from Beijing for The\nAssociated Press.
