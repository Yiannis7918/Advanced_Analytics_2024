Wild!\n\nSome people consider it reasonable to name combinators after types of birds.\nThey make lists like the Ornithodex or L\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki's comprehensive Combinator\nbirds (naturally, there's a list for these lists). There is something wrong\nwith these people. Some of these birds are not even real. \"Quixotic bird\"?\nHave you not heard of a quail? Nonetheless, I don't judge such afflicted souls\n(certainly not publicly), and have provided this translation table to explain\nBQN in terms they can understand.\n\nBQN| Bird 1| 1| Bird 2| 2  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n\u22a3| Identity| I| Kestrel| K  \n\u22a2| Identity| I| Kite| KI  \n\u2218| Bluebird| B| Blackbird| B1  \n\u25cb| Bluebird| B| Psi| \u03c8  \n\u0307| Kestrel| K| KK  \n\u22b8| B1CBSC| Queer| Q  \n\u27dc| Starling| S| ~Dove| D-like: labcd.ac(bd)  \n\u0303| Warbler| W| Cardinal| C  \nk G H| Dove| D| Eagle| E  \nF G H| Phoenix| \u03a6| Pheasant| \u03a61  \n  \nLambda calculus doesn't have BQN's polymorphism on one or two arguments, so\neach BQN combinator corresponds to two lambda calculus forms depending on the\nnumber of arguments, giving the two columns of birds above.\n\nInputs are mapped to lambda calculus arguments according to the ordering FGwx,\nand GFH for a 3-train F G H. For example, when I write that the combination w\nF \u0303 x corresponds to a call of C or labc.acb, a is F and bc are wx.\n\nBird enthusiast Conor Hoekstra now claims what he originally mistook for a\n\"Golden Eagle\" is in fact a Pheasant. Announced in that paper mentioned at the\ntop, the new identification is based on Haskell Curry's use of \u03a61 for the\ncombinator in a 1931 paper.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
