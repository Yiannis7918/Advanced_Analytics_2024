The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been\npresented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.\n\nVendors43 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adform\n  * Advanced store\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bannernow\n\n1-10 / 43\n\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit,\ncontent you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about\nyou (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 / 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It\nwants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on\nits mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have\npreviously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present\nyou with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n\nA profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having\nsearched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant\nadvertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors127 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * ADventori\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n\n1-10 / 127\n\nMeasure advertising performance\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an\nonline shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click\nwill be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will\nbe measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n\nYou are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an\n\u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the\napp of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 / 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the\nadvertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile\ndevices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors28 vendor(s)\n\n  * AdGear\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Amobee (Nexxen)\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bombora\n  * Clinch\n  * Crimtan\n  * Emerse\n  * Google Ads\n\n1-10 / 28\n\nDevelop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nA technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in\nmobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are\nconnecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads\nthat are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve\ntheir performance.\n\nAn advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer\ndevice.

than all the portraits in the world except possibly\nfor the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it\u2019s in the Frick which thank\nheavens you haven\u2019t gone to yet so we can go together for the first time and\nthe fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurism just\nas at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or at a rehearsal\na single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me and what good\ndoes all the research of the Impressionists do them when they never got the\nright person to stand near the tree when the sun sank or for that matter\nMarino Marini when he didn\u2019t pick the rider as carefully as the horse it seems\nthey were all cheated of some marvellous experience which is not going to go\nwasted on me which is

O\u2019Hara\u2019s poem \u201cHaving a Coke With You,\u201d which reads:\n\nIt captures the thrill of romantic infatuation, the feeling of being so\nsmitten with someone that spending time in their company is better than\nanything else you can imagine.\n\nThe text of \u201cHaving a Coke With You.\u201d\n\nTravel, work, painting, even poetry itself \u2014 none of that can hold a candle to\nthe everyday pleasure invoked in the title.\n\n\u201cHaving a Coke With You\u201d is breezy and forthright, and also intriguing and\nelusive.\n\nReading it is like going on a perfect first date: It makes a beguiling\nimpression, and right away you want to get to know it better.\n\nFrank O\u2019Hara, a fixture of the New York School of poets in the 1950s and early\n\u201960s, wrote poems about \u2014 and in the midst of \u2014 a busy social and professional\nlife.\n\nA photograph of Frank O\u2019Hara exiting the Museum of Modern Art. He wears a dark\novercoat and tie.\n\nHis writing is crowded with friends, lovers, cab rides, parties and gossip.\n\nA photograph of a crowded party, people standing in their coats, holding\ndrinks and cigarettes. Frank O\u2019Hara is in the center of the frame.\n\nThis busy, unassuming everydayness \u2014 \u201cI do this I do that\u201d poems, O\u2019Hara\ncalled them \u2014 has led some critics to dismiss his poetry as trivial, or to\ncelebrate its ephemeral, spontaneous qualities at the expense of its formal\naccomplishment.\n\nA photograph of Frank O\u2019Hara, sitting in a butterfly chair, with legs crossed.\nHe smiles at someone off-camera.\n\nHaving a Coke With You by Frank O\u2019Hara\n\nis even more fun than going to San Sebastian, Ir\u00fan, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonne\nor being sick to my

Thou art more lovely and more\ntemperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer\u2019s lease\nhath all too short a date; Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And\noften is his gold complexion dimm'd; And every fair from fair sometime\ndeclines, By chance or nature\u2019s changing course untrimm'd; But thy eternal\nsummer shall not fade, Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow\u2019st; Nor shall\ndeath brag thou wander\u2019st in his shade, When in eternal lines to time thou\ngrow\u2019st: So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, So long lives this, and\nthis gives life to thee.\n\nSonnet 18 by William Shakespeare\n\nShall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day? Thou art more lovely and more\ntemperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer\u2019s lease\nhath all too short a date; Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And\noften is his gold complexion dimm'd; And every fair from fair sometime\ndeclines, By chance or nature\u2019s changing course untrimm'd; But thy eternal\nsummer shall not fade, Nor lose possession of that fair thou

life to thee.\n\nSong of Myself by Walt Whitman\n\n1 I celebrate myself, and sing myself, And what I assume you shall assume, For\nevery atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.\n\nI loafe and invite my soul, I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of\nsummer grass.\n\nMy tongue, every atom of my blood, form\u2019d from this soil, this air, Born here\nof parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same, I, now\nthirty-seven years old in perfect health begin, Hoping to cease not till\ndeath.\n\nCreeds and schools in abeyance, Retiring back a while sufficed at what

as the horse it seems\nthey were all cheated of some marvellous experience which is not going to go\nwasted on me which is why I\u2019m telling you about it\n\nBut as with most good poetry, the effects \u2014 in this case, of informality, of\ncasualness, of companionable ease \u2014 are the products of precise and careful\ncraft.\n\nThe text of \u201cHaving a Coke With You.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving a Coke With You\u201d unfolds as one breathless ungrammatical utterance: a\n325-word run-on that starts with the title ...\n\n... and ends without a period.\n\nAll those words are layered into counterpointed rhythmic passages and arranged\nin long-lined stanzas.\n\nIn the first stanza, a blizzard of exotic place-names (gleaned from O\u2019Hara\u2019s\nrecent trip to Europe for the Museum of Modern Art, where he worked) ...\n\n... dissolves into a series of partial explanations for why O\u2019Hara would\nrather be with you.\n\nThese lines are stitched together with visual and verbal echoes. The orange of\nthe tulips and the orange shirt.\n\nThe Spanish city of San Sebasti\u00e1n and the martyr St. Sebastian, an emblem of\nmale beauty in European painting since the Middle Ages, and a longstanding\nqueer icon.\n\nThe \u201cbetter happier St. Sebastian\u201d O\u2019Hara is talking to has the advantage of\nbeing a real person. A guy who likes yogurt. Is there any word, or any\nsubstance, less poetic than that (especially when you spell it with an \u201ch\u201d)?\nThat\u2019s part of the charm, of course.\n\nThe poem\u2019s hinge comes in this crucial, two-word line.\n\nNow we see that the joy of looking is what the poem is all about.\n\nLooking at paintings.\n\nLooking at flowers.\n\nAbove all, looking at \u201cyou,\u201d kid.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d like other pronouns, is what linguists call a \u201cshifter,\u201d a word without\na fixed referent. Whoever is reading the poem is, literally and impossibly,\nthe person O\u2019Hara would like to have a Coke with.\n\nSome of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets achieve this kind of immediacy.\n\nThe text of William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cSonnet 18.\u201d\n\nShall he compare you to a summer\u2019s day?\n\nMany of Walt Whitman\u2019s poems use the second person to draw the reader near.\n\nThe first section of Walt Whitman\u2019s \u201cSong of Myself.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cyou\u201d occurs more than 100 times in the 1892 version of Whitman\u2019s\nlong poem \u201cSong of Myself\u201d \u2014 twice in the first three lines.\n\nAnd \u201cyou,\u201d since it doesn\u2019t specify gender ...\n\nThe text of \u201cHaving a Coke With You.\u201d\n\n... can throw a cloak of discretion over same-sex attraction.\n\nThe identity of this particular \u201cyou\u201d isn\u2019t a secret at all.\n\n\u201cHaving a Coke With You\u201d was written for Vincent Warren, a dancer O\u2019Hara met\nin the summer of 1959.\n\nA full-length photograph of Vincent Warren, shown in a graceful, balletic\npose. He is dressed in black, his body silhouetted against a stark white\nbackground.\n\nOver the course of their nearly two-year love affair, Warren inspired almost\n50 poems, which, according to O\u2019Hara\u2019s biographer, Brad Gooch, surprised even\nthe poet \u201cin their openness and clarity.\u201d\n\nA photograph of Vincent Warren and Frank O\u2019Hara. Warren looks directly at the\ncamera, while O\u2019Hara is shown in profile.\n\nO\u2019Hara was more than a decade older than Warren, and the age gap may have\nsomething to do with the hint of didacticism that runs beneath the poem\u2019s\nfrisky surface.\n\nThe world of art is one that the poet might help his less worldly boyfriend\ndiscover, for example by accompanying him to the Frick for his first viewing\nof Rembrandt\u2019s \u201cThe Polish Rider,\u201d the only portrait that might compare to\nWarren\u2019s beauty.\n\nA photograph of Rembrandt\u2019s \u201cThe Polish Rider\u201d as it appeared in a gallery at\nthe Frick. The painting is hung in an ornate gilt frame.\n\nO\u2019Hara was an art critic and a curator at MoMA as well as a poet. He counted\namong his friends some of the leading painters and sculptors of the day.\n\nHe was particularly close to second-generation abstractionists, including Joan\nMitchell and Grace Hartigan, and to figurative painters like Larry Rivers,\nWynn Chamberlain and Alex Katz, all of whom painted his portrait.\n\nArt was his life, and the source of his livelihood.\n\nHaving a Coke With You by Frank

is Vincent Warren, so why should O\u2019Hara care?\n\nThe text of \u201cHaving a Coke With You.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Hara\u2019s love for him renders art redundant, annoying, beside the point.\n\nPartly because (as O\u2019Hara might say), one of the functions of art is to arrest\nthe flux of experience, to freeze it, to stop time. But that\u2019s not what this\npoem wants.\n\nWhat it aspires to is captured in a surreal, synesthetic image of the two\nlovers dissolving into the air as afternoon turns to evening.\n\nCould that be painted?\n\nThe image approximates, or maybe reverses, what O\u2019Hara is doing in the poem.\nHis voice evokes, expresses \u2014 exhales \u2014 what his eyes have seen.\n\nBut the emphasis is less on the things he sees than on the act of looking,\nless on the fixed meaning of words than on the act of speaking them.\n\nIn \u201cPersonism: A Manifesto,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek broadside written in September\n1959, several months before \u201cHaving a Coke With You,\u201d O\u2019Hara wrote about\nsitting down to write a love poem and realizing he \u201ccould use the telephone\ninstead of writing the poem.\u201d\n\nPersonism aspires to place the poem \u201cbetween two persons instead of two\npages.\u201d\n\nInstead of being about \u201csome marvellous experience,\u201d a poem is a marvelous\nexperience, like \u201cThe Polish Rider\u201d when you see it in the right company.\n\nCan any art really achieve that? Not if art is understood in terms of\n\u201cunpleasantly definitive\u201d works endowed with cultural authority and inherited\nprestige \u2014 as \u201cstatuary\u201d or as \u201cliterature.\u201d\n\nBut what if art, on the contrary, has the ability to dissolve the boundaries\nof time and space, to give shape and expression to fleeting sensations as well\nas deep emotions?\n\nSong of Myself by Walt Whitman\n\n2 Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with\nperfumes, I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it, The\ndistillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.\n\nThe atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is\nodorless, It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it, I will go to the\nbank by the wood and become undisguised and naked, I am mad for it to be in\ncontact with me.\n\nThe smoke of my own breath, Echoes, ripples, buzz\u2019d whispers, love-root, silk-\nthread, crotch and vine, My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my\nheart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs, The sniff of green\nleaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color\u2019d sea-rocks, and of hay\nin the barn, The sound of the belch\u2019d words of my voice loos\u2019d to the eddies\nof the wind, A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,\nThe play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag, The delight\nalone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides, The\nfeeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and\nmeeting the sun.\n\nHave you reckon\u2019d a thousand acres much? have you reckon\u2019d the earth much?\nHave you practis\u2019d so long to learn to read? Have you felt so proud to get at\nthe meaning of poems?\n\nStop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,\nYou shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns\nleft,) You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look\nthrough the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books, You shall not\nlook through my eyes either, nor take things from me, You shall listen to all\nsides and filter them from your self. ...\n\nSong of Myself by Walt Whitman\n\n2 Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with\nperfumes, I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it, The\ndistillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.\n\nThe atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is\nodorless, It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it, I will go to the\nbank by the wood and become undisguised and naked, I am mad for it to be in\ncontact with me.\n\nThe smoke of my own breath, Echoes, ripples, buzz\u2019d whispers, love-root, silk-\nthread, crotch and vine, My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my\nheart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs, The sniff of green\nleaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color\u2019d sea-rocks, and of hay\nin the barn, The sound of the belch\u2019d words of my voice loos\u2019d to the eddies\nof the wind, A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,\nThe play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag, The delight\nalone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides, The\nfeeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and\nmeeting the sun.\n\nHave you reckon\u2019d a thousand acres much? have you reckon\u2019d the earth much?\nHave you practis\u2019d so long to learn to read? Have you felt so proud to get at\nthe meaning of poems?\n\nStop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,\nYou shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns\nleft,) You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look\nthrough the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books, You shall not\nlook through my eyes either, nor take things from me, You shall listen to all\nsides and filter them from your self. ...\n\nThat\u2019s what poetry often aspires to do: to conjure a living presence through\nwords.\n\nThe second section of Walt Whitman\u2019s \u201cSong of Myself.\u201d\n\nWhitman does this in \u201cSong of Myself,\u201d when he grabs you by the arm and\nliterally promises you the world.\n\nPainters do it too.\n\nRembrandt, in the 1600s, captures the vitality of a young man you could swear\nyou just saw on the subway four centuries later.\n\nHaving a Coke With You by Frank O\u2019Hara\n\nis even more

O\u2019Hara.\n\nHe makes you feel as if the poem exists only between you and him, a private\nconfidence, a secret smile.\n\nHe was just 40 when he died, in July 1966, after being hit by a jeep on Fire\nIsland.\n\nYou can\u2019t really have a Coke with him. Except that, somehow, you can, which is\nwhy I\u2019m telling you about it.\n\nProduced by Erica Ackerberg, Lucky Benson, Greg Cowles, Alicia DeSantis, Nick\nDonofrio and Gabriel Gianordoli.\n\n### Take a Closer Look at This Art\n\nA Poem (and a Painting) About the Suffering That Hides in Plain Sight\n\nWith war looming, W.H. Auden stood in a museum and was inspired to write. The\nresulting poem, \u201cMus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts,\u201d is one of the most famous ever written\nabout art.\n\n19 Lines That Turn Anguish Into Art\n\nElizabeth Bishop was a master at containing and concealing emotion, but her\nextraordinary poem \u201cOne Art\u201d is a moving testament to loss.\n\nThe Impressionist Art of Seeing and Being Seen\n\nIt looks like a gentle scene of a seaside vacation. But this painting by\nBerthe Morisot, perhaps the most underrated Impressionist, is a layered vision\nof a dawning modern age.\n\nAn Art Revolution, Made With Scissors and Glue\n\nThe greatest breakthrough of 20th-century art was something you probably did\nin elementary school.\n\nA Picture of Change for a World in Constant Motion\n\nWhat a masterpiece of Japanese printmaking teaches us about the way images\ncirculate.\n\nA Madonna Who Shows the Beauty in Going Overboard\n\nThis Parmigianino painting is strange, unfinished and not to everyone\u2019s\nliking. But it\u2019s got style.\n\nHow a Gray Painting Can Break Your Heart\n\nThis austere work by Jasper Johns doesn\u2019t seem to invite much of a close read.\nBut its cool surface belies a depth of feeling, which shows us all the power\nof artistic restraint.\n\nSearching for Lost Time in the World\u2019s Most Beautiful Calendar\n\nWhat is a day, a month, a year? Science, religion and art coalesce in an\ninvaluable 15th-century book of hours.\n\nClose Read is a series produced by Alicia DeSantis, Nick Donofrio, Gabriel\nGianordoli, Tala Safie and Josephine Sedgwick.\n\nImages: Frank O\u2019Hara exiting MoMA: Fred W.
