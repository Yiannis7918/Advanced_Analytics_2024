Surely they're not the only open-source-based app out\nthere.\n\nRather reminds me of the ongoing spat between Archive.today and CloudFlare\n(https://community.cloudflare.com/t/archive-today-is-failing-again/534317).\nWhen something works for everyone else and not you... the problem might be\nyou.\n\nvintner\n\nApril 19, 2024 6:02 PM\n\nIs there an article about what restrictions exclude VLC from the Mac App Store\nbut not the iOS App Store?\n\ngalad\n\nApril 20, 2024 2:07 AM\n\nProbably they don't want to sandbox the Mac version, there is no additional\nlimitation specific to the Mac App Store. Even the Android version wants full\ndisk access, which is really horrible.\n\nbob\n\nApril 20, 2024 12:49 PM\n\nLast I tried to sandbox my Mac app (and gave up) it\u2019s really horrible for file\naccess. VLC wants to do things like auto detect and auto open a subtitles file\nadjacent to the video file. No can do, without annoying user prompts. There\u2019s\nno middle ground between full disk access and single file access. Sibling file\naccess is not a thing.\n\n### Leave a Comment\n\n\u2190 \u2192\n\nBlog Archives Tag Cloud Top Posts\n\nRecently Updated RSS Feed \u00b7 Comments Mastodon \u00b7 Twitter Apple News\n\nSupport this site via Patreon.\n\nTry my Mac apps:\n\nDropDMG EagleFiler SpamSieve ToothFairy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2000\u20132024 Michael Tsai.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
