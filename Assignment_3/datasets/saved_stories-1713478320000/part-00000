Gerby is tailored towards making large online\ntextbooks and reference works more accessible.\n\nIn case you were wondering, a gerbe is a kind of stack (in the mathematical\nsense), and the software was originally meant for the Stacks project.\n\n### Tags\n\nA tag is a short identifier (usually four symbols long, e.g. 02DX), that is\npermanently associated to a label in your LaTeX document. If the number\nassociated to the label changes, because you move it or because the text\nbefore the label changes, the tag remains the same.\n\nAnything in your document which has a number (sections, theorems, equations,\n...) needs to have a label associated to it in your LaTeX code, and then in a\nseparate file (the tags file) you set up a dictionary between labels and tags.\nThis file looks like\n\n    \n    \n    0000,first-definition 0001,first-lemma 0002,second-lemma 0003,second-definition 0004,second-lemma 0005,main-theorem\n\nalbeit it much longer probably.\n\nAt this point you only have a LaTeX document, and a tags file. These are all\nthe ingredients you need for the next step.\n\n### Online view\n\nWhen everything has been assigned a tag, Gerby will convert your LaTeX\ndocument into small HTML files, one for each tag. We then import these into\nthe database, which in turn is used by a Flask website. This way you get\n\n  * a page for every tag\n  * easy navigation around your document\n  * a fulltext search\n\nAdditionally\n\n  * the bibliography is taken care of\n  * there are statistics pages for each tag\n  * it is possible to comment on each tag, so that readers can interact when there are questions, typos or mistakes\n\n## Showcase\n\nThe main example are\n\n  * The Stacks project: an open source textbook and reference work on algebraic geometry, by Johan de Jong (Gerby was originally developed for this purpose)\n  * Kerodon: an online resource for homotopy-coherent mathematics, by Jacob Lurie.\n\nIf you are interested in using the system for your own project and have\nquestions, please get in touch!\n\n## How to use it\n\nThe process consists of 3 parts, which we will explain in detail below.\n\n  1. run plastex on your LaTeX file and tags file\n  2. run the import script on the output from step 2\n  3. start the server\n\nThe result of each step is\n\n  1. a large number of small HTML and auxiliary files\n  2. an SQLite3 database containing the output of step 1, together with all the metadata\n  3. a local web server that serves your Gerby instance\n\nWe are in the process of making the code more generic, please get in touch if\nyou are interested in running your own instance.\n\n## Hello world\n\nIn gerby-project/hello-world we have collected a minimal working example of\nwhat it means to use Gerby and plasTeX for your own project.\n\nThe main files here are:\n\n  * document.tex contains a minimal LaTeX document, with labels\n  * tagger.py is an example script to automate the tag assignment\n  * configuration.py is the Gerby configuration file for our example project\n\nand most importantly .travis.yml contains all the steps that are needed to\nsetup the system. This script is run automatically on a virtual server, so all\nsteps are guaranteed to work (provided your configuration approximates that of\nthe virtual server).\n\nSome remarks:\n\n  * the file document.tex cannot be built by pdflatex: we have to remove the amsthm package\n  * similarly other packages might break plasTeX, so you should keep your packages as vanilla as possible, and work with custom preambles\n\nThe file .travis.yml should be self-explanatory, as it lists the shell\ncommands one needs to execute to set up everything. The subtle steps are\nprobably step 4 and 5 of the installation. One way of avoiding this is by\nusing full paths in the configuration file.\n\nIf you are more ambitious, you can also set up the Stacks project, following\nsome more elaborate instructions.\n\n## Contributors\n\n  * Pieter Belmans\n  * Raymond Cheng\n  * Johan de Jong\n\nThis page was generated by GitHub Pages.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
