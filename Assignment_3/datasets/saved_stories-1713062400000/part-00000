Win a ticket to QCon or InfoQ Dev Summit.Find\nout more\n\nDuring his QCon London presentation, Ranbir Chawla, senior vice president of\nengineering at RB Global, presented the journey his team took from moving from\nan \"architectural perfect storm\" and a highly manual operational system to a\nproduct company with a modern event-based architecture that can be released in\nless than one hour. The company now focuses on providing real business\noutcomes to its stakeholders, and ensuring developers find joy in their work.\n\nRB Global, an auction platform for agricultural and heavy-duty machinery, is\nan atypical candidate for digital transformation. Chawla mentioned that many\nof the company\u2019s operations involved \"white glove\" manual operations\nexternally and internally. Through the transformation process, he wanted to\nretain the care for the sellers and buyers using the platform but simplify the\nworkflow of internal workers. One of the end users described the ideal system\nas \"one she could work with using just one monitor\", not using three monitors\nas with the previous system.\n\nThe initial system was an \"architecture perfect storm\" that resulted from\nRitchie Brothers becoming RB Global through multiple acquisitions. This\nprocess brought together a series of systems without proper integration.\n\nDuring the discovery period, Chawla had to work through the cacophony of\nvoices, although nobody was talking publicly about the system\u2019s shortcomings.\nHe decided to start as if he were building the system from scratch and tackle\neach problem as he got to it.\n\nChawla pointed to the important aspects of the transformation process:\n\n> You need to know your business model to transform it.\n\nEven if some voices felt they were doing e-commerce and wanted to create a new\nsystem by extending the Shopify platform, he challenged that affirmation \u2013 the\ncompany didn\u2019t sell any \"two items that are the same (even if they are the\nsame model of digger, they always had a different history)\". The inventory is\nalso distributed across the world. So, he concluded their business model is\ncloser to that of a stockbroker: selling the product owned by a party to\nanother party and asking for a commission for the operation.\n\n> The product is your partner. Become a product-driven company.\n\nChawla underlined that during the transformation, the company was also moving\ntowards becoming a software product company (and similar statements were made\nduring the keynotes and other presentations from the architectural track). In\nthis journey, a key role was that of the product department as they were \"the\nintegrating circuit\" connecting the business side and the technology team.\nThis allowed each technical team to focus on the domain of the services they\nwere responsible for, incorporating the needed logic in the service\nresponsible for it.\n\nChawla stated that to cut through the complexity of the inherited system, the\nkey aspect was the focus on \"radical simplicity\", focusing on what would\ndeliver the most meaningful value to the company \"the unfair competitive\nadvantage\" that will allow the company to have the edge against its\ncompetitors. From the technical perspective, he mentioned that they didn\u2019t\ncount lines of code but focused on delivering business outcomes and \"developer\njoy\". To ensure those were met, they deployed code fast (under <1 hour even\nthough they didn\u2019t deliver each day to production), but the product team\nprovided feedback often.\n\nChawla considered that as an architect, you are responsible for \"retaining\ndeep knowledge\" but also for helping the stakeholders understand the\ndecisions\u2019 tradeoffs of moving or rebuilding a system. He pointed out that\ndiagrams representing the domain capabilities of different systems are useful,\neven if they are not architectural diagrams. Another decision was: what needs\nto be customised for RB Global, and what can be bought?\n\nIn the final part of the presentation, Chawla pointed out the key serendipity\nmoments of the journey to the platform: the business owners speaking in the\ndomain language, starting to hear a common language across the organisation,\nand the development team considering composing different APIs for building new\nfeatures.\n\nChawla underlined the importance of containing the complexity of the systems\nbehind clean APIs. In the case of the system his team built, he pointed to the\ncomplexity of different taxation rules around the globe. For example, in the\nEU there are tax exemptions for agricultural machinery, while in some of the\nstates in the US, payments above a given limit must be conducted in a specific\nway.\n\nChawla closed the presentation by pointing out that the engineering\norganisation is the competitive advantage of RB Global. The company built its\nenablement platform to ensure the teams receive feedback swiftly. As a servant\nleader, he ensured everybody had the proper tools to deliver value. He\nconcluded that the journey never ends, pointing to the difficulties of moving\nfrom a project to a product mindset.\n\n## About the Author\n\n#### Olimpiu Pop\n\nTech Executive and Engineer Focused on a Holistic Approach and using\ntechnology to provide solutions to real problems with minimal impact on the\nenvironment.
