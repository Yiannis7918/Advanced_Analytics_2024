First, features of mitochondrial dysfunction in the general\npopulation of children with ASD were identified. Second, characteristics of\nmitochondrial dysfunction in children with ASD and concomitant mitochondrial\ndisease (MD) were compared with published literature of two general\npopulations: ASD children without MD, and non-ASD children with MD. The\nprevalence of MD in the general population of ASD was 5.0% (95% confidence\ninterval 3.2, 6.9%), much higher than found in the general population\n(\u223c0.01%). The prevalence of abnormal biomarker values of mitochondrial\ndysfunction was high in ASD, much higher than the prevalence of MD. Variances\nand mean values of many mitochondrial biomarkers (lactate, pyruvate, carnitine\nand ubiquinone) were significantly different between ASD and controls. Some\nmarkers correlated with ASD severity. Neuroimaging, in vitro and post-mortem\nbrain studies were consistent with an elevated prevalence of mitochondrial\ndysfunction in ASD. Taken together, these findings suggest children with ASD\nhave a spectrum of mitochondrial dysfunction of differing severity. Eighteen\npublications representing a total of 112 children with ASD and MD (ASD/MD)\nwere identified. The prevalence of developmental regression (52%), seizures\n(41%), motor delay (51%), gastrointestinal abnormalities (74%), female gender\n(39%), and elevated lactate (78%) and pyruvate (45%) was significantly higher\nin ASD/MD compared with the general ASD population. The prevalence of many of\nthese abnormalities was similar to the general population of children with MD,\nsuggesting that ASD/MD represents a distinct subgroup of children with MD.\nMost ASD/MD cases (79%) were not associated with genetic abnormalities,\nraising the possibility of secondary mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment\nstudies for ASD/MD were limited, although improvements were noted in some\nstudies with carnitine, co-enzyme Q10 and B-vitamins. Many studies suffered\nfrom limitations, including small sample sizes, referral or publication\nbiases, and variability in protocols for selecting children for MD workup,\ncollecting mitochondrial biomarkers and defining MD. Overall, this evidence\nsupports the notion that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with ASD.\nAdditional studies are needed to further define the role of mitochondrial\ndysfunction in ASD.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Exome-wide analysis implicates rare protein-altering variants in human\nhandedness\n\nArticle Open access 02 April 2024\n\nDick Schijven, Sourena Soheili-Nezhad, ...

ASDs are behaviorally\ndefined by impairments in communication and social interaction along with\nrestrictive and repetitive behaviors.^1 An estimated 1 out of 110 individuals\nin the United States is currently affected with ASD, with a male-to-female\nratio of 4.5:1.^2 The etiology of ASD is not known in most cases, but a\ngenetic component, possibly involving 15 or more loci, is widely accepted to\ncontribute to the development of ASD.^3 However, the robust phenotypic and\ngenotypic heterogeneity among individuals with ASD^4, 5 has limited the case\nfor a purely genetic etiology.^6, 7 Indeed, it is becoming apparent that many\nchildren with ASD have associated underlying medical comorbidities, such as\nepilepsy, sleep disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction and gastrointestinal\n(GI) abnormalities.^8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in several psychiatric^14, 15\nand neurological^16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 disorders. Over 20 years ago,\nColeman and Blass^23 hypothesized that individuals with ASD may have an\nabnormality in carbohydrate metabolism, and in 1998 Lombard^24 proposed that\nASD may be a disorder of impaired mitochondrial function. Over the past\ndecade, evidence has accumulated that some individuals with ASD have\nconcomitant mitochondrial dysfunction, and some have proposed a \u2018mitochondrial\nautism\u2019 subgroup.^25 Several review articles have been recently published\nconcerning mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD.^9, 26, 27, 28 However, to date,\nneither a systematic comprehensive review nor a meta-analysis of this recently\nevolving literature has been published. In this paper, we systematically\nreview the evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD with the following\nspecific objectives:\n\n  * To calculate the prevalence of mitochondrial dysfunction and clinical, biochemical, histological, and genetic markers of mitochondrial dysfunction in the general population of children with ASD.\n\n  * To calculate the effect size of the differences in the values of biochemical markers of mitochondrial dysfunction between the general population of children with ASD and control groups.\n\n  * To examine the clinical, biochemical, histological and genetic characteristics of children diagnosed with mitochondrial disease (MD) or mitochondrial dysfunction and concomitant ASD (referred to hereafter as ASD/MD) and compare these characteristics with the general ASD population and to the general childhood MD population.\n\n  * To review studies examining the prevalence of ASD or autistic features in children with MD.\n\n  * To review studies correlating biomarker values of mitochondrial dysfunction with the severity of ASD symptoms.\n\n  * To review animal models of ASD with abnormal energy pathways.\n\n  * To examine treatments of mitochondrial dysfunction in children with ASD.\n\nBefore presenting this analysis, we provide an overview of the importance of\nmitochondrial function in health and disease, with reference to mechanisms\nthat overlap biochemical abnormalities associated with ASD. We also briefly\ndiscuss the standardized methods for diagnosing MD.\n\n## Mitochondrial function in health and disease\n\nMitochondria are distinct cellular organelles that generate adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP), the energy carrier in most mammalian cells, from adenosine\ndiphosphate by oxidizing glucose and fatty acids (for a review, see Haas et\nal.^29). Acetyl-CoA is a key intermediate generated from the oxidation of\nglucose and fatty acids that is further metabolized by the tricarboxylic acid\n(TCA) cycle. The TCA cycle produces reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide and\nreduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Reduced nicotinamide adenine\ndinucleotide and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide transport energy to the\nmitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), a series of reactions known as\noxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria contain two plasma membranes, an inner\nand an outer membrane. The ETC is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane\nand consists of five multi-subunit enzyme complexes (complexes I through V)\nand two electron carriers (ubiquinone, also known as co-enzyme Q10, and\ncytochrome c).^30 See Figure 1 for an overview of mitochondrial function.\n\nFigure 1\n\nMitochondrial function and the electron transport chain (ETC).

The color reproduction of this figure\nis available on the html full text version of the article.\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\nFull size image\n\nMitochondria are the only organelle in mammalian cells with their own genome.\nThe ETC is coded by both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA).^30\nmtDNA contains 37 genes that code for 13 subunits of complexes I, III, IV and\nV, as well as the machinery required to translate and transcribe the mtDNA\ngenes into ETC complex subunits. The remainder of the ETC complex subunits are\ncoded by over 850 nDNA genes.^31 nDNA also codes for mitochondrial enzymes\nthat participate in carbohydrate and fatty acid oxidation. Thus, mutations in\neither genome can impair mitochondrial function and cause ETC complex\ndeficiencies.^32\n\nThe ETC is the predominant source and the major target of reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS)^20, 33 and is protected from damage caused by ROS by a\nmitochondrial-specific superoxide dismutase and antioxidants such as\nglutathione (GSH).^33 Mitochondria lack the enzymes to synthesize GSH and\ntherefore are dependent on cytosolic GSH production.^34, 35 The depletion of\nGSH in mitochondria makes cells more vulnerable to oxidative stress and damage\nfrom ROS originating from the mitochondria.^36 Additionally, factors that\nincrease ROS production (such as, environmental toxicants, infections and\nautoimmune disease) can directly and indirectly lead to impairments in ETC\nactivity,^27, 37, 38 deplete GSH,^37 and activate mitochondrial and non-\nmitochondrial-dependent biochemical cascades that result in programmed cell\ndeath (apoptosis).^39\n\nCertain mammalian cells, such as neuronal and non-neuronal brain cells, are\nvery vulnerable to oxidative stress (for example, damage caused by ROS). The\nhigh rate of oxygen delivery and consumption in the brain provides the oxygen\nmolecules necessary to generate ROS. The brain's ability to withstand\noxidative stress is limited because of: (a) a high content of substrates that\nare easily oxidized, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids; (b) relatively low\nlevels of antioxidants, such as GSH and antioxidant enzymes; (c) the\nendogenous generation of ROS via several specific reactions; and (d) the\nendogenous generation of nitric oxide (NO), a compound that readily transforms\ninto reactive nitrogen species. Furthermore, the brain is very vulnerable to\noxidative damage because it contains non-replicating cells which, once\ndamaged, may be permanently dysfunctional or committed to apoptosis.^37, 39\n\nThe number of mitochondria in each cell depends on the cellular energy\ndemands. For example, low energy cells, such as skin cells, have fewer\nmitochondria, while cells that require high energy demands, such as muscle,\nliver, brain, cerebrovascular endothelium and GI cells, have many\nmitochondria. Neural synapses are areas of high energy consumption^40 and are\ntherefore especially dependent on mitochondrial function.^41 Mitochondria are\nconcentrated in the dendritic and axonal termini where they have an important\nrole in ATP production, calcium homeostasis and synaptic plasticity.^42, 43\nMitochondrial dysfunction can lead to reduced synaptic neurotransmitter\nrelease, and neurons that have high firing rates, such as GABAergic\ninterneurons, may be the most adversely affected.^27 Mitochondria also have an\nimportant role in cellular lipid metabolism, signaling and repair.^44, 45\n\nMD was once thought to be uncommon but is now considered the most recognized\ncause of metabolic disease.^30 Despite increased recognition, the prevalence\nof MD is probably underestimated.^46 The minimum birth prevalence of an ETC\ndefect with onset at any age has been estimated at 1 in 7634 individuals\n(\u223c0.01%).^47 More than 100 mtDNA deletions and over 150 mtDNA point mutations\nhave been described in individuals with MD.^29 MD has a broad phenotypic\npresentation: children with MD can have normal intelligence, mental\nretardation or developmental delay.^48 Stressors, such as dehydration, fever\nand infection can lead to a functional decline and neurodegenerative\nregression in individuals with MD.^49, 50\n\nThe diagnosis of MD can be challenging, and is based on several objective\nclinical, histological, biochemical, molecular, neuroimaging and enzymatic\nfindings. Several major diagnostic criteria are used^51, 52, 53, 54, 55 to\nclassify the probability of MD into: not likely, possible, probable or\ndefinite; individuals reaching the criteria for probable or definite are\ntypically considered to have MD. The diagnostic criteria recognize several\ntypes of clinical presentations. These include primarily muscular or central\nnervous system presentations or multisystem presentations.^54, 55 In addition,\npatients can present clinically with one of the well-characterized\nmitochondrial syndromes.^55 Other important diagnostic features include\nabnormal histology (such as, ragged-red or blue fibers in skeletal muscle, or\nskeletal muscle with reduced cytochrome c oxidase or succinate dehydrogenase\nstaining, or electron microscopy demonstrating abnormal mitochondria or\nsubsarcolemmal mitochondrial accumulations), abnormal enzymology\n(significantly impaired ETC activity), identification of an mtDNA or nDNA\nmutation, abnormal neuroimaging and abnormal biochemical markers.^54, 55\n\nNo reliable biomarker exists to identify all cases of MD.^29 Biochemical\nmarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction described in the literature include\ndirect (lactate, pyruvate, lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, ubiquinone, alanine,\nalanine-to-lysine ratio and acyl-carnitine) and indirect markers (creatine\nkinase (CK), carnitine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine\naminotransferase (ALT) and ammonia).^25, 29, 54, 56, 57 These markers can be\nabnormal for several reasons. For example, mitochondrial dysfunction impairs\naerobic respiration, leading to a reduction in TCA cycle function resulting in\nan elevation in pyruvate (see Figure 1). Pyruvate is metabolized to lactate\nand alanine, leading to elevations in these metabolites when pyruvate\nmetabolism is impaired.^30, 56 Inhibition of the TCA cycle may result in an\nelevation of TCA cycle intermediates. Inhibition of aerobic respiration also\nimpairs fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation, leading to elevations in the concentrations of\nacyl-carnitines. Furthermore, anaerobic respiration increases when aerobic\nrespiration is insufficient to meet cellular energy demands. As lactate is one\nof the end-products of anaerobic respiration, deactivation of aerobic\nrespiration further elevates lactate. As a result of this, the measurement of\nplasma lactate can be helpful in the initial workup of mitochondrial\ndysfunction.^30, 54 However, lactate may be elevated only during illness, or\nnot at all, in children with MD.^48, 57 In fact, normal cerebrospinal fluid or\nserum lactate levels do not rule out MD.^48, 58\n\nIndirect markers of mitochondrial function can also be abnormal in MD. For\nexample, depletion in total and free carnitine can occur as a consequence of\nexcessive unprocessed fatty acids.^56 Ammonia may be elevated for at least two\nreasons. First, under anaerobic conditions, ammonia is produced when adenosine\nmonophosphate is broken down into inosine monophosphate in order to replenish\nATP. Second, as the urea cycle is partially located in the mitochondria,\nmitochondrial dysfunction can result in secondary urea cycle dysfunction and\nan elevation in ammonia. In addition, the integrity of certain high-energy\ntissues, such as muscle and liver, can be compromised from mitochondrial\ndysfunction, resulting in elevations in indicators of tissue damage such as\nCK, AST and/or ALT.\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction can be classified as either primary or secondary.^29\nPrimary mitochondrial dysfunction generally refers to mitochondrial\ndysfunction caused by a defect in a gene directly involved in the function of\nmitochondrial systems responsible for producing ATP, whereas secondary\nmitochondrial dysfunction refers to other metabolic or genetic abnormalities\nthat impair the ability of mitochondria to produce ATP. For example,\nmetabolites produced by toxic substances (for example, environmental\ntoxicants) or by the dysfunction of other metabolic systems that are not\nspecifically involved in producing ATP (for example, increased oxidative\nstress because of dysfunctional antioxidant pathways) can interfere with the\nability of mitochondria to make ATP and lead to secondary mitochondrial\ndysfunction. Other reported causes of secondary mitochondrial dysfunction\ninclude: certain medications;^29, 59, 60 enteric short chain fatty acids, such\nas propionic acid;^61, 62, 63, 64, 65 elevated concentrations of tumor\nnecrosis factor-\u03b1;^66, 67, 68 cerebral folate deficiency;^69, 70\nmalnutrition;^71 heme, vitamin B6, or iron deficiencies;^72 elevated NO;^73,\n74, 75 GSH deficiency;^73 oxidative stress;^36 or exposure to environmental\ntoxicants, such as heavy metals,^76, 77, 78, 79 chemicals,^80 polychlorinated\nbiphenyls^81 or pesticides.^82, 83 Some individuals have findings consistent\nwith MD but do not have an identifiable genetic defect and/or do not meet full\ncriteria for definite or probable MD. It is possible that these individuals\nhave secondary mitochondrial dysfunction^9, 25, 84, 85 or may have an as yet\nunidentified genetic abnormality. In this review article, we collate evidence\nof both primary and secondary mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Search strategy\n\nA prospective protocol for this systematic review was developed a priori, and\nthe search terms and selection criteria were chosen in an attempt to capture\nall pertinent publications. A computer-aided search of PUBMED, Google Scholar,\nCINAHL, EmBase, Scopus and ERIC databases from inception through August 2010\nwas conducted to identify pertinent publications using the search terms\n\u2018autism\u2019, \u2018autistic\u2019, \u2018Asperger\u2019, \u2018ASD\u2019, \u2018pervasive\u2019, and \u2018pervasive\ndevelopmental disorder\u2019 in all combinations with the terms \u2018mitochondria\u2019 OR\n\u2018mitochondrial\u2019 OR \u2018lactic\u2019 OR \u2018lactate\u2019 OR \u2018pyruvate\u2019 OR \u2018pyruvic\u2019 OR\n\u2018ammonia\u2019 OR \u2018creatine kinase\u2019 OR \u2018oxidative phosphorylation\u2019 OR\n\u2018phosphorylation\u2019 OR \u2018carnitine\u2019 OR \u2018acyl-carnitine\u2019 OR \u2018fatty acid oxidation\u2019\nOR \u2018alanine\u2019 OR \u2018respiratory chain\u2019 OR \u2018electron transport chain\u2019 OR \u2018energy\u2019\nOR \u2018ATP\u2019 OR \u2018adenosine.\u2019 The references cited in identified publications were\nalso searched to locate additional studies.

Studies were initially included if they (1) involved individuals\nwith ASD, and (2) reported at least one finding that could indicate\nmitochondrial dysfunction. We also included animal models of ASD with abnormal\nenergy pathways. Abstracts or posters from conference proceedings were\nincluded if published in a peer-reviewed journal. After screening all records,\n98 publications met inclusion criteria; both reviewers then independently\nreviewed these articles. Articles were excluded if they:\n\n  * Did not involve animals or humans or human cells (for example, cellular models).\n\n  * Did not present new or unique data (such as, review articles or letters to the editor).\n\n  * Presented duplicate data.^51, 86, 87\n\n  * Reported biochemical markers related to a non-mitochondrial disorder^88, 89, 90, 91 or cellular mechanism.^92, 93\n\n  * Reported markers related to a known side effect of a medication (for example, elevated ammonia from valproic acid or rhabdomyolysis from olanzapine).^94, 95\n\n  * Involved only Rett syndrome or childhood disintegrative disorder.\n\nA total of 68 publications,^5, 23, 25, 28, 35, 48, 49, 58, 61, 62, 64, 65, 85,\n96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111,\n112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126,\n127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141,\n142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150 describing 65 unique studies, met\ninclusion and exclusion criteria (see Figure 2), including three sets of\npublications (6 publications total) that studied the same population but\nprovided slightly different information.^28, 119, 120, 132, 133, 144\n\n### Clinical characteristics in children with ASD compared with controls\n\nWe reviewed all studies that included children with ASD and presented\nbiochemical markers that could indicate mitochondrial dysfunction. A meta-\nanalysis was performed based on the information derived from these studies.\nThere are two types of measures derived from the studies reviewed: prevalence\nvalues, and comparisons of biomarker values between ASD and control groups. A\nmean prevalence value was computed by dividing the number of participants with\nabnormal values for all studies by the number of participants evaluated for\nall studies. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was then calculated assuming a\nBernoulli distribution.^151 Several statistics were computed for the\ncomparisons of continuous biomarker values between the ASD and control groups:\n(a) means and variances were computed for both groups; (b) the variances of\nthe two groups were compared using an F-ratio; (c) two different methods were\nused to calculate the effect size; and (d) the homogeneity statistic Q was\ncalculated for each effect size. Calculating effect size from populations that\nhave different variability can be problematic. Therefore, we formally compared\nthe variability in the ASD and control groups using an F-ratio. Two approaches\nare used to calculate the effect size for populations with different\nvariability. Glass et al.^152 introduced the Glass's \u0394, which is based only on\nthe control s.d. Others have suggested that a statistic, such as the Hedge's\ng, which uses the average sample s.d., is a truer representation of the effect\nsize.^153 Thus, we calculated both Glass's \u0394 and Hedge's g. In addition, we\ncalculated the homogeneity statistic Q in order to test whether or not the\neffect sizes are estimated from the same population means across studies.^154\n\n### Clinical characteristics in children with ASD and MD compared with\ncontrols\n\nWe also reviewed all studies that reported individuals with ASD and a\nconcomitant diagnosis of MD or mitochondrial dysfunction (ASD/MD). All of\nthese studies described young children and adolescents, with the oldest being\n20 years old. Since these studies spanned the entire childhood population, we\nrefer to this population as children. One case series reported that the\nclinical characteristics of children with ASD/MD are atypical of the general\nASD population.^25 However, that study^25 did not quantitatively compare the\ncharacteristics of these two groups. Therefore, we directly compared the\nprevalence of characteristics of these two groups to determine if, in fact,\nthere are differences in the characteristics of ASD/MD as compared with the\ngeneral ASD population, and, if so, which characteristics distinguish these\ntwo groups. In order to perform this analysis, we calculated the prevalence of\ncommonly reported clinical characteristics compiled from the studies of\nchildren with ASD/MD as well as biochemical and genetic markers of\nmitochondrial dysfunction (see Table 3 and Supplementary Table S1). We\nidentified a total of 11 commonly reported clinical characteristics of\nmitochondrial dysfunction (ataxia, cardiomyopathy, fatigue/lethargy, GI\nabnormalities, growth delay, hypotonia, male-to-female ratio, motor delay,\nmyopathy, regression and seizures). We then compared the prevalence of these\n11 characteristics and abnormal biomarker values for children with ASD/MD to\ntwo control groups: (a) the general population of children with ASD, and (b)\nthe general population of children with MD. In order to determine the\nprevalence of these 11 clinical characteristics of mitochondrial dysfunction\nin the general population of children with ASD, we performed a literature\nsearch for these characteristics in ASD. The results of this search are found\nin the Supplementary Table S2. In order to minimize bias, we only included\nstudies that had large sample sizes (96\u2013987 children per study; mean 359\nchildren; total of 2870 children), were published in high impact journals, and\nwere either epidemiology/population-based/longitudinal studies^155, 156, 157,\n158, 159, 160 or large studies performed in academic settings.^161, 162 The\nprevalence of certain clinical characteristics uncommon in the general ASD\npopulation, such as ataxia, cardiomyopathy, fatigue/lethargy, growth delay and\nmyopathy could not be calculated for this group because adequate studies\nreporting these characteristics could not be identified. For the prevalence of\nabnormal mitochondrial biochemical markers in the general ASD population, we\nused the prevalence results generated from our meta-analysis (as listed in\nTable 1) for comparison. In order to determine the prevalence of clinical\ncharacteristics and biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction in the general\npopulation of children with MD, we performed a literature search for the above\n11 clinical characteristics as well as the biomarkers listed in Table 3. The\nresults of this search are found in the Supplementary Table S3. To minimize\nbias, we only included studies of MD that had large sample sizes (25\u2013133\nchildren per study; mean 61 children; total of 428 children; one study^50\nincluded 4 adults), were published in high impact journals, and were either\npopulation-based^163 or from large academic/referral centers.^48, 50, 51, 58,\n164, 165, 166 Chi-square analysis was used to compare the prevalence rates\nbetween children with ASD/MD and the prevalence rates in the two comparison\ngroups. We calculated the \u03c7^2 using the observed frequencies of the ASD/MD\ngroup and calculated the expected frequencies using the prevalence rates in\nthe comparison group. Since we conducted 31 statistical tests, we controlled\nfor inflated alpha using the Bonferroni correction. Thus, the statistical\nthreshold was set at an alpha of 0.002 (0.05/31).\n\nTable 1 Pooled prevalence estimates for MD in ASD and for abnormal biomarkers\nof mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD\n\nFull size table\n\n## Results\n\nThe selected studies that reported clinical characteristics and biomarkers of\nmitochondrial dysfunction can be primarily separated into two groups: studies\nof the general ASD population, and studies of children with ASD/MD. In\naddition, two studies reported ASD or features of ASD in children with MD,^48,\n58 and two studies^105, 112 examined correlations between biomarkers of\nmitochondrial dysfunction and the severity of ASD symptoms. Several animal\nmodels of ASD reported abnormalities in energy metabolism. Finally, some\nstudies reported specific treatments for mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD.\nThese studies will be discussed in subsections I through VI separately.\n\n### I. Studies examining the general ASD population\n\nTable 1 outlines the prevalence estimates of MD and abnormal mitochondrial\nbiomarkers in the general ASD population, while Table 2 outlines the mean\ndifferences in mitochondrial biomarker values and associated statistics in\nchildren with ASD as compared with controls. The studies reviewed and selected\nfor individual biomarker calculations are outlined in the Supplementary Table\nS4.\n\nTable 2 Pooled statistics and meta-analysis of group differences for\nmitochondrial biomarkers in ASD compared with controls\n\nFull size table\n\n#### Prevalence of MD in ASD\n\nThree studies examined the prevalence of MD in ASD. Two were large prospective\nstudies^115, 132 that examined the prevalence of MD using criteria as outlined\nby Bernier et al.^55 and used an elevated plasma lactate to select children to\nundergo further workup for MD (a muscle biopsy). In these two studies, MD was\ndiagnosed in 19%^115 to 43%^132 of ASD children with an elevated lactate;\nhowever, only 56%^115 to 79%^132 of children with an elevated lactate\nunderwent a clinical workup for MD. The third study was a retrospective case\nseries that examined 4194 individuals suspected of having mitochondrial\ndysfunction; 276 were reported to have autistic features and 14 of these had\nMD^145 using the modified Walker criteria outlined by Morava et al.^54 From\nthese three studies, meta-analysis (Table 1) demonstrated the overall\nprevalence of MD in ASD was 5.0% (95% CI 3.2, 6.9%). However, it is likely\nthat the prevalence of MD is underestimated by these three studies because:\n(a) individuals with a normal lactate did not undergo a thorough evaluation\nfor MD even though normal lactate levels are found in some children with\nASD/MD;^25, 49, 143, 147, 150 (b) lactate alone was used in two studies^115,\n132 to screen for MD, whereas additional biochemical markers could have been\nused; and (c) children with known medical disorders, such as septo-optic\ndysplasia, which could be related to mitochondrial dysfunction,^167 were\nexcluded from testing for MD.^132 One study was particularly robust as it was\npopulation based and examined the prevalence of MD in children with ASD\nidentified from a population of 67 795 children.^132, 133\n\n#### Prevalence of abnormal biochemical markers of mitochondrial dysfunction\nin ASD\n\nWe reviewed studies that examined the prevalence of abnormalities in\nbiochemical markers, which could indicate mitochondrial dysfunction (Table 1).\nStudies that used unusual methodology could not be included in the analysis:\none study examined the prevalence of abnormalities in a combination of\nbiomarkers rather than just one biomarker;^23 another study examined the\nprevalence of high (alanine and ammonia) and low (free and total carnitine)\nbiomarker values with respect to the normal mean laboratory values instead of\nthe upper or lower limit of normal;^141 and one study reported the prevalence\nof an elevated lactate-to-pyruvate ratio only in a subgroup of ASD children\nwith elevated lactate.^132\n\nSix studies^107, 112, 115, 116, 132, 136 examining the prevalence of elevated\nlactate, two studies^116, 136 examining the prevalence of elevated pyruvate,\none study reporting the prevalence of lactate-to-pyruvate ratio elevation,^115\nand another study reporting the prevalence of elevated alanine^104 in the\ngeneral population of ASD were included in the meta-analysis. Almost one-third\nof children with ASD had elevations in lactate and/or the lactate-to-pyruvate\nratio, while the prevalence of pyruvate and alanine elevation was lower. The\nprevalence of lactate elevation varied widely from study to study. The reason\nfor this is not clear; however, variations in blood collection technique are\nwell known to cause differences in lactate values. Unfortunately, many of the\nstudies that examined lactate, pyruvate or the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio did\nnot report the technique used to collect blood (for example, fasting vs non-\nfasting, tourniquet vs no tourniquet). Presumably, within each study, the\nblood collection technique was consistent, although failure to maintain such\nconsistency could result in an additional source of variation in these\nmeasurements.\n\nIndirect biochemical markers of mitochondrial dysfunction also appear to be\nabnormal in the general ASD population with a much higher prevalence than the\naforementioned direct biomarkers (see Table 1). The prevalence of low total\ncarnitine^112 and elevated ammonia^116 were examined in one study each. Only\none study^85 looked at the prevalence of CK, AST and ALT elevation, with the\nprevalence of AST elevation being significantly higher as compared with a\ncontrol group (children with other neurological disorders but not ASD). As\nthese indirect markers are more nonspecific than direct markers of\nmitochondrial dysfunction, they could be abnormal because of other problems.\n\n#### Values of abnormal biochemical markers of mitochondrial dysfunction in\nASD\n\nTable 2 outlines the mean values (with CIs) of biochemical markers of\nmitochondrial dysfunction, along with meta-analysis statistics, for ASD and\ncontrol groups. Five studies^107, 108, 112, 127, 131 reported lactate values;\none study reported pyruvate values;^107 one study reported carnitine\nvalues;^112 and one study examined ubiquinone concentrations.^110 Of note, one\nstudy examined the correlation between carnitine and lactate levels.^112\nAdditionally, one study reported AST and ALT values,^85 and two studies\nreported CK values.^106, 127 Some studies could not be included in the\nanalysis because of limitations. For example, one study reported significantly\nhigher mean plasma alanine and lysine in children with ASD compared with\ncontrols,^109 and another compared urinary alanine^103 between ASD and control\ngroups. However, both of these studies^103, 109 only provided the information\ngraphically. Another study reported a significantly lower mean lysine in a\nsubgroup of children with ASD on a restricted diet, but not in those on an\nunrestricted diet, compared with controls; this study also reported elevated\nalanine prevalence but not alanine values.^104 One study reported\nsignificantly increased mean alanine transport in fibroblasts from ASD\nchildren compared with controls but did not report alanine values.^118\nFinally, a longitudinal study reported abnormal elevations in polyunsaturated\nlong chain fatty acids and/or saturated very long chain fatty acid-containing\nethanolamine phospholipids in children with ASD compared with controls.^130\nAlthough the investigators in this latter study postulated that one mechanism\nthat could account for these elevations was mitochondrial dysfunction,^130\nthese abnormalities are not commonly accepted biochemical markers of\nmitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nPopulation variability, as indexed by the F-value, was significantly greater\nin the ASD group as compared with the control group for all biochemical\nmarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction except ubiquinone, with the difference\nparticularly marked for pyruvate. This is consistent with the notion that a\nsubgroup of ASD children has abnormal mitochondrial biomarker values or that\nthe range of biochemical marker values of mitochondrial dysfunction is much\nlarger for the ASD population in general, suggesting that children with ASD\nmight have a spectrum of mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nThe effect sizes calculated using either the Hedge's g or Glass's \u0394 methods\nwere large and statistically significant for lactate (1.9-fold higher in ASD),\npyruvate (2.0-fold higher in ASD), carnitine (1.7-fold lower in ASD) and\nubiquinone (1.6-fold lower in ASD) but not for CK, AST or ALT. Q was\nstatistically significant for the lactate Glass's \u0394 effect size indicating\nthat the effect size significantly varied across studies. Individual Glass's \u0394\neffect sizes for lactate were statistically significant for each study and\nvaried from a minimum of 1.56^127 to a maximum of 6.41.^107 Although the\neffect sizes for lactate varied across studies, even the smallest effect size\nwas quite robust. Interestingly, one study reported a significant inverse\ncorrelation between carnitine and lactate levels.^112\n\n#### Prevalence of mtDNA abnormalities in ASD\n\nIn one study, mtDNA deletions of varying length (9.7\u201313.7 kb) were found in 8\nof 12 (67%) children with ASD, but the specific genes affected were not\nreported.^146 However, when specific mtDNA mutations have been investigated in\nthe general ASD population, very few individuals with mutations have been\nfound. For example, one study of 810 individuals with ASD that searched for\nmtDNA mutations (A3243A>G, T8993T>G, T8993T>C and A8344A>G) only identified\ntwo individuals (0.2%) with a mutation affecting tRNA (A3243A>G).^135 Another\nstudy of 129 individuals with Asperger syndrome and 138 mothers of individuals\nwith Asperger syndrome searched for the A3243A>G mutation, but no such\nmutation was found.^134 Finally, in a study of 162 individuals with ASD, no\nsignificant association was observed between mtDNA haplogroup and ASD as\ncompared with a control population.^121\n\n#### Prevalence of nDNA abnormalities in ASD\n\nThree nDNA genes associated with mitochondrial function have been studied in\nthe general ASD population. Two studies examined the inner mitochondrial\nmembrane peptidase 2-like gene,^5, 102 while 11 studies examined gene\nexpression and/or single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the SLC25A12 gene that\ncodes for the calcium-dependent mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier\n(AGC) isoform 1.^101, 111, 113, 114, 115, 117, 122, 124, 125, 126, 129 The\nevidence for an association with either of these genes was mixed and thus\ninconclusive, possibly due to clinical and genetic heterogeneity between\nstudies and small sample sizes.^129 Additionally, one study reported that\nseveral single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the microtubule affinity-regulating\nkinase 1 gene, a gene associated with mitochondrial trafficking, were\nassociated with ASD, and microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 1\noverexpression was demonstrated in postmortem frontal cortex samples in\nindividuals with ASD as compared with healthy controls.^123 However, this\nassociation has yet to be confirmed by additional studies. Thus, to date, no\nconclusive association between ASD and an nDNA gene associated with\nmitochondrial function has been found.\n\n#### mRNA expression in ASD\n\nOne recent study found normal mRNA expression of the mitochondrial complex I\n75-kDa subunit in the general ASD population.^100\n\n#### In vitro studies of mitochondrial function and mitochondrial oxidative\nstress in ASD\n\nThree controlled studies compared in vitro mitochondrial function in\nlymphoblasts obtained from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange between\nindividuals with ASD and control individuals. In the first study, the ASD\ngroup demonstrated depressed complex I function, normal complex II activity\nand borderline elevated complex IV activity compared with controls. In\naddition, a higher mitochondrial maximal respiratory rate was found in the ASD\ngroup and believed to be a compensatory response to the depression in complex\nI function.^119, 120 In another lymphoblast study, the mean baseline ATP\nconcentration in the ASD group was equivalent to controls, but exposure to\nphysiological concentrations of NO reduced the mitochondrial membrane\npotential in the ASD lymphoblasts more than in the control lymphoblasts.^35\nFinally, one study reported a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in ASD\nmitochondria compared with controls.^128 These studies support the notion that\nsome individuals with ASD manifest mitochondrial dysfunction and compensatory\nmechanisms for such dysfunction.\n\nTwo studies using Autism Genetic Resource Exchange samples measured markers of\nmitochondrial oxidative stress in vitro between individuals with ASD and\ncontrol individuals. In one study, higher concentrations of ROS and reactive\nnitrogen species were found in ASD mitochondria compared with controls,\nconsistent with increased generation of mitochondrial free radicals.^128 In\nthe second study, a lower mean concentration of mitochondrial reduced GSH was\nfound in ASD lymphoblasts compared with controls, consistent with a lower\nmitochondrial GSH reserve. Additionally, exposure to ethylmercury (thimerosal)\nled to a larger increase in the generation of free radicals and a greater\nreduction in the ratio of reduced GSH to the oxidized disulfide form of\nglutathione (GSSG) in the ASD cells compared with control cells.^35 These\nstudies suggest that some individuals with ASD manifest increased oxidative\nstress that may originate from mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\n#### Neuroimaging in ASD\n\nIn some individuals with ASD, metabolites relating to brain bioenergetics have\nbeen measured non-invasively using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. One small\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy study demonstrated significantly decreased\nlevels of phosphocreatine and esterified end products (\u03b1ATP, \u03b1-adenosine\ndiphosphate, dinucleotides and diphosphosugars) in the brains of ASD\nindividuals compared with controls.^105 Another magnetic resonance\nspectroscopy study measured N-acetyl-aspartate and lactate levels in the\nfrontal lobe, temporal lobe and the cerebellum, and found significantly lower\nN-acetyl-aspartate levels in the cerebellum of ASD children compared with\ncontrols as well as elevated lactate in the frontal lobe of one child with\nASD.^108 A reduced concentration of brain N-acetyl-aspartate may be a marker\nof mitochondrial dysfunction,^168 although this is an area of debate.^169\nHowever, changes in the other metabolites appear consistent with abnormal\nbrain bioenergetics.\n\n#### Brain pathology in ASD\n\nIn one small controlled study, post-mortem brain oxidized (carbonylated)\nmitochondrial protein content was nonsignificantly (P=0.12) elevated by\nthreefold in the ASD group compared with controls with four of six (67%) ASD\nbrains demonstrating large elevations.^101\n\n### II. Studies examining children with ASD/MD\n\nEighteen studies reported a total of 112 children (up to 20 years of age) with\nmitochondrial dysfunction or MD and concomitant ASD\n(ASD/MD).^25,28,48,49,58,85,99,115,132,133,136,139,140,142,143,144,145,147,149,150\nMany (11 of 18, 61%) of these studies did not specify the diagnostic criteria\nused.^28, 58, 85, 99, 136, 139, 140, 142, 143, 147, 149 Only 8 of 18 (44%)\nstudies examined family history of MD with 3 of 8 studies (37.5%) noting a\npositive family history. Three additional studies^137, 138, 148 that did not\ndemonstrate sufficient evidence to confirm mitochondrial dysfunction or MD\nwere not included in the analysis: one study demonstrated elevations in\nseveral acyl-carnitines in a child^148 consistent with a fatty acid oxidation\ndefect; another reported reduced free carnitine and a mild ammonia elevation\nin two children;^138 while the final study described elevated urinary TCA\ncycle metabolites in two children.^137 Another study reported elevated\nlactate, pyruvate or alanine in 13 of 28 children with ASD/MD but did not\nreport a prevalence for each biomarker, and therefore the prevalence of these\nmarkers could not be calculated nor included in the analysis.^49 Finally, one\nstudy reported the prevalence of seven abnormal mitochondrial histological\nfindings, but it was unclear from the study how many children had more than\none abnormal finding, and therefore the prevalence of each finding could not\nbe calculated nor included in the analysis.^25\n\nClinical characteristics as well as the biochemical and genetic markers of\nmitochondrial dysfunction reported in these 112 children with ASD/MD are found\nin the Supplementary Table S1. Interestingly, 103 (92%) children were first\ndiagnosed with ASD before MD, 2 (2%) were diagnosed first with MD before\nASD,^140, 143 while in 7 (6%) it was unclear which diagnosis was made\nfirst.^48, 58, 136, 142 Several features of MD were not reported with enough\nfrequency to calculate the prevalence of such features in children with\nASD/MD. These features included sleep abnormalities,^85 ammonia\nelevations,^140 carnitine abnormalities,^140 elevated alanine-to-lysine\nratio^85 and nDNA or chromosomal abnormalities.^140, 150 The prevalence of the\nclinical characteristics and biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD/MD\nare provided in Table 3. Table 3 also presents prevalence estimates derived\nfrom the selected comparison papers (reviewed in Materials and Methods\nsection) and statistically compares children with ASD/MD with the general\npopulation of ASD children and the general population of children with MD. The\nprevalence of abnormal organic acids and elevated alanine was relatively high\nin ASD/MD, but adequate studies reporting these markers could not be\nidentified in the general population of MD in order to compare these markers.\n\nTable 3 Prevalence of clinical characteristics and mitochondrial biomarkers in\nchildren with ASD/MD with comparison with the general ASD and MD populations\n\nFull size table\n\n#### Comparisons between children with ASD/MD and the general ASD population\n\nChildren with ASD/MD demonstrated some distinct characteristics as compared\nwith the general population of children with ASD. Developmental regression,\nseizures, motor delay (such as, significantly delayed walking) and GI\nabnormalities (such as, reflux or constipation) were significantly more\nprevalent in children with ASD/MD as compared with the general ASD population.\nIt is notable that children with ASD/MD demonstrated a relatively high\nprevalence of motor delay (51%), regression (52%), fatigue/lethargy (54%),\nataxia (58%) and GI abnormalities (74%). Although motor delay was\nsignificantly more common in ASD/MD, the prevalence of hypotonia was not\nsignificantly different between children with ASD/MD and the general ASD\npopulation. Lactate and pyruvate, but not the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio or CK,\nwere elevated with a significantly higher prevalence in children with ASD/MD\nas compared with children in the general ASD population. Interestingly, the\nASD/MD population had a significantly more balanced male-to-female ratio than\nchildren from the general ASD population.\n\n#### Comparisons between children with ASD/MD and the general MD population\n\nThe prevalence of male gender, developmental regression, seizures, hypotonia,\ncardiomyopathy and myopathy was not significantly different between MD groups\nwith and without ASD. However, the prevalence of fatigue/lethargy, ataxia, GI\nabnormalities and elevated lactate was significantly higher in children with\nASD/MD as compared with the general population of MD. The prevalence of an\nabnormal brain imaging scan was significantly lower in children with ASD/MD as\ncompared with the general MD population.\n\nThe prevalence of complex I, II, III, IV, V and multiple complex deficiencies\nwas not significantly different between children with MD with and without ASD,\nnor was the prevalence of elevated citrate synthase or mtDNA abnormalities.\nHowever, the prevalence of abnormal histology on light microscopy was\nsignificantly more common in the general population of MD compared with\nASD/MD. The most common complex deficiency in children with ASD/MD was in\ncomplex I (53%). Children with ASD/MD were also significantly more likely to\nhave normal ETC activity. Of note, complex V activity was only reported in\nfive studies of ASD/MD,^48, 49, 58, 132, 139 although it was abnormal in a\nrelatively high percentage in some studies.^132, 139\n\n#### Mitochondrial histology and ultrastructural abnormalities in children\nwith ASD/MD\n\nOne case series reported several mitochondrial histological abnormalities,\nincluding variations in muscle fiber size, regenerating fibers, atrophic\nfibers, muscle inflammation, increased myofiber lipid content and reduced\ncytochrome oxidase staining.^25 Only three studies reported \u2018ragged-red\nfibers\u2019 in children with ASD/MD,^25, 99, 139 which is not surprising as the\npresence of ragged-red fibers is an unusual finding in children, even in those\nwith MD.^30\n\nThe ultrastructural abnormality most commonly reported was mitochondrial\nproliferation.^25, 28, 49, 138, 139, 140, 142, 144 Some studies described\nspecific ultrastructural abnormalities, such as mitochondria with abnormal\ncristae,^139 inclusions,^139 and abnormally shaped and sized mitochondria.^25,\n139, 149 However, these features were not reported with enough frequency to\ncalculate accurate prevalence values or to compare them with the general\npopulation of MD.\n\n#### Genetic abnormalities in children with ASD/MD\n\nOnly 24 of 112 (21%) children with ASD/MD had an mtDNA, nDNA or chromosomal\nabnormality. Table 4 reviews the mtDNA abnormalities reported in ASD/MD,\nincluding mtDNA depletion, mutations and deletions. mtDNA abnormalities were\ntested in 87 of 112 (78%) children with ASD/MD with 20 of 87 (23%)\ndemonstrating an abnormality (see Supplementary Table S1). mtDNA depletion and\ndeletions were reported in three^49, 142, 145 and five individuals with\nASD/MD,^139 respectively. Pathogenic mtDNA mutations were described in 12\nchildren with ASD/MD.^25, 99, 142, 145, 147 Interestingly, no abnormalities\nwere found in the majority (77%) of children with ASD/MD in which mtDNA was\nexamined.\n\nTable 4 Number of cases of mtDNA abnormalities reported in the general\npopulation of children with ASD and in children with ASD/MD\n\nFull size table\n\nAdditionally, one study reported an nDNA mutation (SCO2) in an individual with\nASD/MD.^145 This mutation could adversely affect the synthesis of cytochrome c\noxidase.^170 Two chromosomal abnormalities were reported to be associated with\nASD/MD: two children had an inverted duplication of 15q11\u2013q13^140, and one\nchild had a deletion in 5q14.3.^150 However, the relationship between these\nchromosomal abnormalities and ASD or mitochondrial dysfunction is unclear.\n\n### III. Studies correlating biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction with ASD\nsymptoms\n\nIn one study of 11 individuals with ASD and 11 normal controls, abnormal\nlevels of brain markers of mitochondrial function measured by magnetic\nresonance spectroscopy (including phosphocreatine, \u03b1ATP, \u03b1-adenosine\ndiphosphate, dinucleotides and diphosphosugars) significantly correlated with\nthe severity of language and neuropsychological deficits in the ASD group but\nnot in the control group.^105 In another study of 30 children with ASD, those\nwith severe ASD (as measured by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale) had both\nsignificantly lower carnitine and higher lactate concentrations than those\nwith mild or moderate ASD.^112 Additional studies are needed to evaluate these\napparent correlations.\n\n### IV. Prevalence of ASD or autistic features in MD\n\nTwo retrospective case series of children with MD reported ASD or features of\nASD in some of the children;^48, 58 one other case series presented duplicate\ndata and was not included in the analysis.^51 The overall prevalence of ASD or\nASD features in children with MD was calculated to be 4.6% (95% CI 0.3, 8.9%).\nHowever, since these studies were not population based, they may not\naccurately reflect the true prevalence of ASD in children with MD.\n\n### V. Animal models of ASD with abnormal function of the energy pathway\n\nSeveral animal models of ASD exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction. For example, a\nrecent rat model of ASD demonstrated that the administration of propionic\nacid, a fermentation end product of enteric bacteria, induced mitochondrial\ndysfunction and led to certain brain, behavioral and metabolic changes\nconsistent with ASD, including features such as repetitive behaviors, social\ninteraction problems, hyperactivity, oxidative stress, lowered GSH levels,\nmicroglial activation and altered carnitine levels.^61, 62, 64, 65 In a mouse\nmodel, mutations in the SLC25A12 gene, a susceptibility gene for ASD, which\ncodes for a mitochondrial AGC that is crucial for supporting oxidative\nphosphorylation and ATP production, resulted in neurofilamentous accumulations\nin neurons and myelination deficits. Interestingly, the myelin deficits could\nbe reversed by the administration of pyruvate in vitro.^97 The maternal\nubiquitin protein ligase E3A deficiency mouse is a model of Angelman's\nsyndrome, a syndrome that frequently includes ASD features. Recently, this\nmouse model was reported to have abnormal mitochondrial morphology and a\npartial oxidative phosphorylation defect in complex III in the hippocampal\nregion.^171 The MECP2-null mouse is a mouse model of Rett syndrome, a\nneurodegenerative disorder that includes ASD features. This mouse demonstrates\ndecoupling of the respiratory complexes and overexpresses the nuclear gene for\nubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 1, a gene that codes for a\nsubunit of ETC complex III.^172 Creatine helps to maintain adequate ATP levels\nin tissues with high energy requirements and a specific creatine transporter\nis required for the uptake of creatine by cells.^173 A mouse model of a\ncreatine transporter gene mutation (SLC6A8) reported seizure activity and\nautistic-like behavior.^98 Finally, a mouse model of neuronal glucose\ntransporter isoform 3 deficiency demonstrated certain autistic characteristics\nincluding seizure activity, abnormal social behavior and stereotypies.^96\nGlucose transporter isoform 3 mediates the uptake of glucose by neurons and\nimpaired glucose transporter isoform 3 activity in vitro has been associated\nwith subsequent ATP depletion.^174\n\n### VI. Treatment of mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD\n\nSeveral studies suggested that nutritional supplements and/or antioxidants may\nbe beneficial in some children with ASD who have MD or abnormal biomarkers of\nmitochondrial function. Carnitine was the most commonly noted supplement to be\nhelpful.^28, 85, 130, 138, 140, 150 Along with carnitine, some investigators\nreported clinical improvements with co-enzyme Q10^85, 143, 150 and high doses\nof B-vitamins, including thiamine or riboflavin.^85, 140, 150 Cerebral folate\ndeficiency was described in one child with ASD/MD,^49 and specific treatment\nwith folinic acid and a milk-free diet has been reported to result in\nsignificant improvements in ASD symptoms in children with cerebral folate\ndeficiency.^175, 176 Unfortunately, a majority of the reviewed studies did not\nreport on any potential treatments for mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examined the evidence for an\noverlap between ASD and mitochondrial dysfunction and/or MD. From our\nanalysis, MD was reported in 5.0% of children with ASD. We also found that\nthere is a rather high prevalence of abnormal values in direct (that is,\nlactate, pyruvate and lactate-to-pyruvate ratio) and indirect (that is,\ncarnitine, ammonia, CK and AST) biochemical markers of mitochondrial\ndysfunction in the general population of children with ASD, and that children\nwith ASD, as a group, have significantly abnormal values for direct (that is,\nlactate, pyruvate and ubiquinone) and indirect (that is, carnitine)\nbiochemical markers of mitochondrial dysfunction compared with controls. The\nvariability in the values of these biochemical markers was, for the most part,\nsignificantly larger in the ASD group as compared with the control groups,\nindicating that the ASD population manifests a wide variety of values of\nbiochemical markers for mitochondrial dysfunction. Two studies reported\nsignificant correlations between markers of mitochondrial dysfunction and\nautism severity. Additionally, there appears to be a high prevalence of mtDNA\ndeletions, but not pathogenic mtDNA mutations, in the general ASD population,\nand studies of nDNA have not found consistent abnormalities. In vitro studies\nwith limited sample sizes have identified mitochondrial dysfunction, lower\nmitochondrial GSH reserve and higher mitochondrial oxidative stress in the\ncells of individuals with ASD compared with controls. Neuroimaging studies\nhave also reported abnormalities in biomarkers of energy metabolism in\nchildren with ASD. One study reported a trend for higher levels of brain\noxidized mitochondrial protein content in ASD compared with controls. Although\nmany of the studies included in this review have limitations, their cumulative\nfindings suggest that there is evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD,\nor at the least, in a subset of children with ASD.\n\nOur review also demonstrates that children with ASD/MD have distinct\ncharacteristics as compared with the general population of children with ASD\nand have many similarities to the general population of children with MD.\nAbnormalities in mitochondrial histology and ultrastructure were reported in\nsome children with ASD/MD. Surprisingly, only a relatively modest percentage\n(21%) of children with ASD/MD had a genetic abnormality that might account for\nmitochondrial dysfunction. Although two studies suggested that children with\nASD or features of ASD constitute a small proportion of the general MD\npopulation,^48, 58 certain limitations of these studies indicate they may not\naccurately reflect true prevalence. Several animal models of ASD reported\nmitochondrial dysfunction. A limited number of studies reported various\nimprovements in children with ASD and mitochondrial dysfunction with certain\ntreatments. Below we will discuss some important aspects of this review,\nlimitations of our analyses, and important avenues for further study.\n\n### Children with ASD/MD: a distinct subgroup of children with ASD or a\ndistinct MD syndrome?\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction is the most common metabolic abnormality associated\nwith ASD.^115, 177 Meta-analysis of three studies^115, 132, 145 indicated that\nthe prevalence of MD in ASD was 5.0% (95% CI 3.2, 6.9%), which is\nsignificantly higher than found in the general population (\u223c0.01%),^47\nindicating that an association between ASD and MD is likely, at least in a\nsubgroup of individuals with ASD.^25 However, this 5% prevalence is most\nlikely an underestimate of the true prevalence of MD in individuals with ASD\nsince these studies excluded children from testing for MD who had either\nnormal lactate or medical disorders potentially related to mitochondrial\ndysfunction. Additionally, two of these three studies exclusively used lactate\nto identify children to be fully assessed for MD.^115, 132 This latter\nlimitation appears to be common in the reviewed studies, as only a few studies\nevaluated ASD children who had a normal lactate for MD.^142, 143, 147, 150\nUsing only lactate as a screening test for MD may miss some individuals with\nMD. In the future, the development of sensitive and specific non-invasive or\nminimally invasive methods for identifying MD, such as the routine examination\nof mitochondrial function in lymphocytes, should make the identification of\nthe true prevalence of MD in ASD children more realistic.\n\nIn general, MD and mitochondrial dysfunction may be underrecognized in the\ngeneral ASD population,^9 especially because the identification of children\nwith ASD and concomitant mitochondrial dysfunction can be quite challenging.\nFor example, biochemical markers may be abnormal only during illness,^25, 49,\n142, 143, 147, 150 tissue mitochondrial heteroplasmy can result in\nmitochondrial dysfunction being limited to only certain body tissues,^99, 139\nand known genetic defects are not commonly found in ASD/MD. Of note, routine\nlaboratory testing to screen for mitochondrial dysfunction in children with\nASD is not often performed,^132 perhaps because previous investigators have\nsuggested that mitochondrial dysfunction is rare in ASD^177 and should only be\nconsidered when there is a family history of MD or neurological features\nsuggestive of MD.^134, 142 However, our review indicates that many children\nwith ASD/MD do not have a family history of MD or neurological features that\ndistinguish them from the general ASD population.^25, 132, 133, 142 In fact,\nthe phenotypic presentation of mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD is quite\nbroad, ranging from significant to no neurological problems,^25, 139, 142, 147\nwith some investigators describing children with ASD/MD as being\nindistinguishable from other children with ASD and others describing them as\natypical for ASD.^25, 132, 133, 142 Furthermore, our review suggests that some\nASD children with abnormal markers of mitochondrial function do not meet\ndefinite or probable criteria for MD but rather may have a mild form of\nmitochondrial dysfunction, such as partial complex deficiencies, that may not\nbe considered significant by some clinicians.^9, 25, 35, 85\n\nInterestingly, two studies reported a significant correlation between\nbiochemical markers of mitochondrial dysfunction and the severity of ASD\nsymptoms.^105, 112 This correlation suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction\nexists on a continuum rather than in a discrete subgroup of ASD children. Such\na notion is consistent with many of the findings in this review, including the\nmuch higher prevalence of abnormal biochemical markers of mitochondrial\ndysfunction as compared with the prevalence of MD in the general ASD\npopulation, and the particularly high variability in biochemical markers of\nmitochondrial dysfunction in the general ASD population. Clearly, additional\nstudies are needed to better define the clinical and biochemical\ncharacteristics of ASD/MD children and to determine if a discrete ASD/MD\nsubgroup exists or whether mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD is better\nrepresented on a continuum.\n\nOur review of the 112 children with ASD/MD reported in the medical literature\nfound several distinct clinical characteristics in this group, such as\ndevelopmental regression, seizures, motor delay, GI abnormalities, and a\nhigher prevalence of elevated lactate and pyruvate, as compared with the\ngeneral ASD population. Additionally, children with ASD/MD had many\nsimilarities to the general population of children with MD, including the\nprevalence of male sex, regression, seizures, hypotonia, cardiomyopathy,\nmyopathy and ETC abnormalities. This suggests that these clinical\ncharacteristics are more likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction than to ASD.\nOf course, this might also be an artifact of using diagnostic criteria for MD\nto define children with ASD/MD. However, other clinical characteristics which\nwere significantly more prevalent in children with ASD/MD as compared with the\ngeneral population of MD, such as fatigue/lethargy, ataxia, GI abnormalities\nand elevated lactate, are unlikely to be due simply to the use of diagnostic\ncriteria. From our review, it also appears unlikely that these abnormalities\nreported in ASD/MD are due to factors, such as poor diet, anxiety or GI\nsymptoms. Although three studies did attempt to identify MD from the general\nASD population, these studies did not fully define the clinical or biochemical\ncharacteristics of the individuals identified.^115, 132, 145\n\nThe finding of a significantly elevated prevalence (74%) of GI abnormalities\n(such as reflux, constipation, diarrhea and inflammation) in children with\nASD/MD compared with both children with ASD and children with MD is intriguing\nand deserves further study. Recently, increased awareness of GI problems in\nASD has been noted^12, 178 and the findings of this review suggest that GI\nabnormalities in ASD may be related, in part, to mitochondrial dysfunction.\nInterestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction has been demonstrated in a mouse\nmodel of inflammatory bowel disease, and carnitine supplementation reversed\nboth the metabolic and clinical abnormalities in this model.^179 It is also\npossible that some metabolites originating from the GI tract, such as\npropionic acid produced by Clostridia, other enteric short chain fatty acids\nand certain cytokines might act as mitochondrial toxins. These factors might\nalso contribute to seizure activity and our analysis found that seizures were\nsignificantly more common in ASD/MD compared with the general population of\nASD. Given the high energy demands of both the GI tract and cerebrovascular\nendothelium, mitochondrial dysfunction may also contribute to barrier\ndysfunction in the brain and GI tract in ASD. Additionally, as mitochondria\nhave an important role in lipid metabolism, previous reports of abnormalities\nin lipid metabolism^180, 181 and lipid peroxidation^182 in some individuals\nwith ASD could be due to mitochondrial dysfunction. Further studies are needed\nto determine the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in barrier dysfunction,\nlipid abnormalities, GI dysfunction and seizure activity in ASD.\n\nInterestingly, in the reviewed studies, no child with ASD/MD presented with a\nclassic mitochondrial syndrome. Some experts have reported that autistic\nfeatures are relatively common in children with MD in conjunction with a\nglobal neurological syndrome.^183 However, the two studies that examined the\npresence of ASD characteristics in the general MD population did not support\nthis assertion. It is possible that children with MD do not present with the\ntypical symptoms of ASD. Alternatively, it may be that features of ASD are not\nspecifically examined or recognized in many children who are diagnosed with\nMD, or that a potentially high severity of the presenting symptoms of MD does\nnot trigger a differential diagnosis of ASD. These possibilities are supported\nby the finding that only 2% of children with ASD/MD were diagnosed with MD\nbefore ASD. It is possible that children with ASD/MD constitute a specific\nsyndrome within children with MD, but further studies will be needed to better\ndefine common clinical symptoms within larger cohorts of children with ASD/MD.\n\n### Regression in children with mitochondrial dysfunction and ASD\n\nTwelve studies reported a regression in developmental milestones in ASD\nchildren who had MD or abnormal biochemical markers of mitochondrial\nfunction.^23, 25, 49, 85, 132, 137, 139, 140, 141, 142, 147, 148, 149 In these\nstudies, regression was noted in several areas, including language, motor\nskills, eye contact, play skills, social interaction and receptive skills. In\none case series of 25 children with ASD/MD, unusual patterns of regression,\nsuch as multiple regressions (9 children), regression with catabolic stress (7\nchildren) and regression after age 3 (6 children) were noted.^25 In some\nstudies, factors associated with regression included illnesses^25, 140, 142\nand fever.^49, 142 For example, in one case series of 28 children with ASD/MD,\nregression was reported in 17 children (61%), with a majority (12/17, 71%)\nexperiencing regression with a fever >101\u00b0F, including 4 of 12 (33%) who\ndeveloped regression with fever following routine vaccination.^49 Regression\nafter routine vaccination was also reported in another child who developed\nASD/MD after a post-vaccination fever.^25, 85 However, these latter three\nstudies^25, 49, 85 noted the important role of childhood vaccinations in\npreventing life threatening diseases. Interestingly, some children with ASD\nhave clinical improvements during fever,^184 suggesting that there are\nsubgroups of children with ASD that respond differently to fever and that it\nis probably not the fever itself, but the underlying physiological process\nleading to fever that is related to regression in children with ASD.\n\nIt should be noted that, in each of the reviewed studies, it is not clear if\nmitochondrial dysfunction contributed to or caused the reported regression.\nOur analysis indicated that the prevalence of regression was significantly\nhigher in children with ASD/MD as compared with the general population of\nchildren with ASD (52 vs 25%). Given that regression in individuals with MD is\nknown to occur with stressors such as dehydration, fever and infection,^50 and\nthat the prevalence of regression in children with ASD/MD is approximately\ndouble that of the general population of ASD, it is likely that the regression\nreported in at least a subset of children with ASD/MD is related to\nmitochondrial dysfunction. This is significant because early identification of\nchildren with underlying MD who might be at risk of undergoing regression into\nASD because of a metabolic stressor could lead to prophylactic measures to\nprevent the development of ASD, or at least minimize the severity of ASD\nsymptoms once acquired. Although such a subset of children is likely to\nconstitute a limited proportion of the general ASD population, given the high\nprevalence of ASD, the absolute number of individuals who could be protected\nis likely to be significant. One caveat is the assumption that these children\nhad identifiable MD before the regression, which is empirically unproven\nbecause the MD was not identified until after the regression.\n\n### Secondary mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD\n\nA majority (79%) of the children with ASD/MD identified in this review did not\npossess a genetic etiology that might account for mitochondrial dysfunction.\nAlthough a yet unidentified genetic defect may be present in some of these\ncases, secondary mitochondrial dysfunction is likely.^9, 85 Biochemical\nabnormalities reported in some children with ASD could contribute to secondary\nmitochondrial dysfunction. For example, several studies have documented a\nsignificantly lower mean GSH concentration^110, 130, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189\nand a lower mitochondrial GSH reserve^35 in children with ASD as compared with\ncontrols. GSH depletion is associated with impaired mitochondrial function^73\nand increased ROS production.^36 Increased ROS can impair mitochondrial\nfunction^36, 190 and may be particularly significant in individuals with ASD\nbecause they have been shown, as a group, to be under higher oxidative stress\nand have reduced levels of antioxidants as compared with controls.^35, 110,\n130, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 191 Furthermore, GSH protects mitochondria\nagainst the adverse effects of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1,^36 a pro-inflammatory\ncytokine that can inhibit mitochondrial function.^66, 67 This might be\nparticularly important since studies have reported higher tumor necrosis\nfactor-\u03b1 in lymphocytes,^192 cerebrospinal fluid^193 and brains^194 of\nindividuals with ASD as compared with controls.\n\nIn one reviewed study, exposure to physiological concentrations of NO reduced\nthe mitochondrial membrane potential in ASD cells more than in control\ncells,^35 suggesting that ASD mitochondria are more vulnerable to the adverse\neffects of NO. Several studies have reported a significantly higher mean\nconcentration of NO in ASD individuals as compared with controls,^110, 195,\n196, 197 making it possible that individuals with ASD are not only more\nvulnerable to NO but also have higher baseline NO concentrations. These two\nfactors could act synergistically to cause significant mitochondrial\nimpairment in individuals with ASD.\n\nAbnormalities in synaptic transmission reported in ASD could also contribute\nto secondary mitochondrial dysfunction. For example, an imbalance in the\nexcitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) neurotransmitter systems\nhas been implicated in the pathogenesis of ASD, with a relative increase in\nthe glutamatergic neurotransmitter system.^198 In vitro glutamate exposure has\nbeen shown to inhibit mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation^130, 199 as well as generate\nROS^200 and deplete GSH.^130, 200 In one reviewed study, in vitro glutamate\nplus malate exposure adversely affected mitochondrial function in cells from\nindividuals with ASD to a greater extent as compared with control cells.^119\n\nIn another reviewed study, exposure to ethylmercury (thimerosal) led to a\nlarger increase in free radical generation and a greater reduction in the\nratio of reduced GSH to GSSG in ASD cells compared with control cells.^35\nThese findings suggest that mitochondria from children with ASD may be more\nvulnerable to damage from environmental toxicants than mitochondria from\ntypically developing children.^35 In this context, exposures to environmental\ntoxicants could contribute to secondary mitochondrial dysfunction in some\nchildren with ASD.^9, 201 For example, in vitro exposure to diesel exhaust\nparticles has been shown to inhibit mitochondrial function,^80 and elevated\nenvironmental concentrations of diesel exhaust particles have been associated\nwith ASD.^202 Other environmental toxicants that inhibit mitochondrial\nfunction and have been associated with ASD include mercury,^76, 77, 202, 203,\n204 lead,^78, 205, 206, 207 cadmium,^79, 202 polychlorinated biphenyls^81, 208\nand pesticides.^83, 209, 210, 211 Interestingly, some investigators have\nsuggested that mtDNA deletions reported in some children with ASD may be\nsecondary to elevated levels of ROS caused by environmental factors.^146\n\nAbnormal calcium signaling, which has been implicated in ASD,^212, 213 may\nalso contribute to secondary mitochondrial dysfunction.^26, 214 For example,\nthe mitochondrial AGC, which is coded by SLC25A12, is involved in the malate-\naspartate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide shuttle and is activated,\nin part, through calcium signaling.^215 One mouse model^97 reported\nmyelination deficits in mice with mutations in SLC25A12 and several\nstudies^111, 113, 122, 124, 125, 126 reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms\nin SLC25A12 were associated with ASD, although this association was not found\nin every study.^114, 115, 117, 129, 216 However, in one study of six\nindividuals with ASD and six controls, increased calcium levels and\nmitochondrial AGC transport rates were observed in all six ASD brains. The\nremoval of calcium by a chelator led to a larger drop in mean AGC transport\nrate in the ASD group compared with controls.^101 This finding suggests that\nabnormal calcium signaling contributes to AGC dysfunction in the brains of\nsome individuals with ASD and may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nA recent rat model of ASD demonstrated that the administration of propionic\nacid induced mitochondrial dysfunction and led to certain behavioral and\nbiochemical features of ASD, such as repetitive behaviors, social interaction\nproblems, hyperactivity, oxidative stress, lowered GSH levels and altered\ncarnitine levels.^61, 62, 64, 65 In addition, Clostridia, an anaerobic, spore\nforming Gram-positive rod bacteria, is known to produce propionic acid^61 and\na derivative of propionic acid recovered in the urine of ASD individuals has\nbeen reported as a marker of Clostridia.^217 Furthermore, significantly\nelevated concentrations of Clostridia in the GI tract have been reported in\nASD children compared with controls^218, 219, 220 with improvements noted with\nvancomycin treatment in some children.^221, 222 Additional studies examining\nthe roles of propionic acid and Clostridia in ASD are needed.\n\nCurrently, it is unclear if these endogenous and exogenous factors reported in\nsome individuals with ASD contribute to secondary mitochondrial dysfunction or\nASD symptoms, or if these factors are merely epiphenomena. However, these\nfactors represent potential pathways that may impair mitochondrial function\nand increase the vulnerability of mitochondria to damage. Furthermore, a\ncombination of these factors may lead to synergistic adverse effects on\nmitochondrial function. In this context, mitochondrial dysfunction could\nworsen a vulnerable system that is already under oxidative stress, resulting\nin an increase in the formation of ROS. As increased ROS can cause further\ndamage to already damaged mitochondria and can directly impair mitochondrial\nfunction,^190 adding mitochondrial dysfunction to a metabolic system that is\nalready under high oxidative stress can result in the initiation of a vicious\ncycle that progressively impairs cellular function, leading to\nneurodegeneration, regression or failure of cognitive systems to properly\ndevelop.^27 Clearly, further studies are needed to examine a possible link\nbetween the effects of these potentially detrimental substances and\nmitochondrial dysfunction in vivo. Although the effects of the environment on\nmitochondrial dysfunction are becoming increasingly recognized,^223 and\nenvironmental pollutants, particularly environmental mercury, have been\nassociated with an increased likelihood of ASD in epidemiological\nstudies,^202, 203, 204 the mechanism of such environmental toxicants for\nincreasing the risk of ASD has not been well studied in vivo. Clearly,\nmitochondrial function is a ripe area of research when investigating the\nbiological mechanism(s) of action of environmental toxicant exposures and\nindigenous abnormalities associated with ASD.\n\n### Mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic transmission in ASD\n\nGiven the association between ASD and mitochondrial dysfunction, it is\npossible that mitochondrial dysfunction might have a role in the development,\npathogenesis or severity of ASD. For example, mitochondrial dysfunction could\nbe specifically detrimental to synaptic transmission because synaptic function\nis highly dependent on mitochondrial function.^41 Furthermore, single-\nnucleotide polymorphisms in microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 1^123 and\nSLC25A12^122 reported in some individuals with ASD could alter synaptic\nplasticity and mitochondrial movement along dendrites. Such possibilities\nwould be consistent with recent studies that have implicated synaptic\ndysfunction in ASD.^224\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction can also lead to reduced synaptic neurotransmitter\nrelease, particularly in neurons with high firing rates, such as GABAergic\ninterneurons.^27 Since GABAergic neurons are inhibitory, they may be\nespecially important between 12 and 30 months of age, because this window of\ndevelopment corresponds to an over-production in excitatory neurotransmitters\nand receptors.^225, 226 Thus, without proper GABAergic neuronal function, the\nbrain may be highly susceptible to excitotoxicity during this developmental\nperiod. Interestingly, this is the age range when regression most commonly\noccurs in ASD.^227 Additional studies are needed to investigate these\npossibilities.\n\n### Identification of mitochondrial dysfunction in children with ASD\n\nIn the reviewed studies, the workup for MD varied widely from study to study.\nLactate was by far the most commonly studied biochemical marker of\nmitochondrial dysfunction in ASD. Both lactate and pyruvate demonstrated a\nhigh prevalence of being abnormal in ASD, were significantly elevated in the\ngeneral ASD population as compared with controls, and had a significantly\nhigher prevalence of being abnormal in ASD/MD as compared with the general ASD\npopulation. Carnitine also had a high prevalence of being abnormal in ASD and\nwas significantly depressed in the general ASD population as compared with\ncontrols. However, it is difficult to determine the utility of certain\nbiomarkers (alanine, ammonia, carnitine, ubiquinone, alanine-to-lysine ratio\nand acyl-carnitine panel) for identifying mitochondrial dysfunction in the\ngeneral population of children with ASD because the number of reports\ndescribing these biomarkers in ASD/MD was limited. Despite the lack of\ninformation that was derived from published reports, these biomarkers should\nbe strongly considered when screening for MD in children with ASD because\nabnormal alanine is a recognized marker of MD^54 and ammonia, ubiquinone and\nan acyl-carnitine panel can help identify mitochondrial dysfunction when\nlactate is not elevated.^57, 228, 229 Further studies are needed to\nsystematically examine the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of\nthese markers for diagnosing MD in the general ASD population.\n\nFigure 3 outlines a suggested algorithm for screening for mitochondrial\ndysfunction in ASD. In order to standardize the collection and optimize the\ndiagnosis of MD, some investigators have recommended obtaining laboratory\ntests in the morning while fasting^38, 56 and repeating abnormal tests to\nverify true abnormalities.^38 Obtaining laboratory values when the patient is\nsick or under physiological stress may also increase the sensitivity of\ndetecting mitochondrial dysfunction.^48, 57 Furthermore, a specific MD can be\ndiagnosed by identifying a known mtDNA or nDNA gene abnormality using\nmolecular testing that requires only a blood draw. However, in the reviewed\nstudies, a genetic defect was not identified in the majority of children with\nASD/MD. When a genetic marker cannot be identified, more invasive testing,\nsuch as a muscle or skin biopsy can be used to confirm MD. Although a muscle\nbiopsy is more invasive than a skin biopsy, detailed pathological examination\nof the muscle can be particularly helpful in confirming MD. Although most\nreviewed studies reported ETC function, fatty acid oxidation pathways can also\nbe examined if a skin biopsy is performed. A reduction in ETC function in two\ntissues can make the diagnosis of MD more definitive. Thus, if a muscle biopsy\nis performed, it is straightforward and advantageous to perform a skin biopsy\nat the same time.\n\nFigure 3\n\nSuggested screening for mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD.

Elevated CK in ASD can occur with\nmuscular dystrophy^89, 91 or rhabdomyolysis.^95 Elevated ammonia in ASD has\nbeen associated with valproate administration^94 and urea cycle disorders.^90\nFurthermore, false-positive elevations in biochemical markers (especially\nlactate) are possible, especially if the child struggles during the blood draw\nor if the sample is not properly processed.^56 Elevations in lactate can also\nbe found in disorders unrelated to MD.^230 Finally, restrictions in diet may\nbe important considerations in testing for MD as one study reported a\nsignificantly lower mean lysine in ASD children on a restricted diet, but not\nin those on an unrestricted diet, compared with controls.^104\n\nThree studies examined the prevalence of MD in ASD and the workups for MD in\nthese studies reflect some of the difficulties that are common in the\nevaluation of MD. For example, in two of these studies, only 56%^115 to\n79%^132 of ASD children with an elevated lactate were tested for MD. This\nlikely reflects the variability in the willingness of families to allow their\nchild with ASD to undergo invasive testing in light of the fact that the\ntreatment for MD is limited (see below) and the yield of an invasive workup is\nvariable. In addition, in these two studies, 19%^115 to 43%^132 of ASD\nchildren with an elevated lactate were found to have MD when fully assessed;\nthis finding reflects the specificity of lactate for identifying MD in ASD and\nthe variability in the yield of MD workups in various clinics.\n\nIt is noteworthy that older guidelines do not recommend a routine metabolic\nworkup in children with ASD.^231 However, newer reviews on the biological\nbasis of ASD have outlined the growing number of mitochondrial and non-\nmitochondrial metabolic disorders associated with ASD.^201, 232, 233, 234\nClearly, more studies are needed to develop sensitive and specific diagnostic\ntechniques for MD in children with ASD. However, until such diagnostic\ntechniques are available, we believe that all children with ASD should be\nscreened for MD given: (a) the high prevalence of abnormal markers of\nmitochondrial function in ASD compared with controls; (b) the relatively high\nprevalence of MD in ASD; (c) some children with ASD who have MD can be\nphenotypically indistinguishable from typical children with ASD; and (d) the\npotential clinical significance of MD in children with ASD.\n\n### Treatment and management\n\nThere is no known cure for MD. However, the treatment and management of MD\nattempt to minimize environmentally and iatrogenically induced damage to\nmitochondria, treat organ dysfunction that results from mitochondrial\ndysfunction, and provide supplementation of important mitochondrial cofactors\nand ROS scavengers. It is essential that individuals with MD avoid\ndehydration, prolonged fasting and/or illnesses that could result in metabolic\ndecompensation.^50 Certain common medications, such as acetaminophen, and\nanesthetics should be avoided and an anesthesiologist familiar with MD should\nbe consulted if anesthesia is necessary.^60\n\nSeveral studies suggested that treatment with mitochondrial cofactor\nsupplementation, including antioxidants, co-enzyme Q10, carnitine and\nB-vitamins may improve mitochondrial function and behavior in some children\nwith ASD. A therapeutic trial of mitochondrial cofactors and antioxidants may\nbe reasonable in children with ASD/MD given the fact that: (a) oxidative\nstress is associated with impaired mitochondrial function;^190 (b) antioxidant\nsupplementation in individuals with MD increases GSH levels;^235 (c)\nmitochondria are dependent on cytosolic GSH production;^34, 35 and (d) these\ncompounds are generally recognized as safe.^9 For example, methylcobalamin and\nfolinic acid have been reported to significantly increase GSH concentrations\nin children with ASD and appear to improve certain autistic behaviors.^185,\n187 Several other antioxidants, including vitamin C,^236 carnosine^237 and\ngalantamine^238, 239, 240 have also been reported to significantly improve\nautistic behaviors. Carnitine may be particularly helpful in children with ASD\nbecause carnitine deficiency has been implicated in ASD,^112, 141 some studies\nhave reported improvements with the use of carnitine in ASD^28, 85, 130, 138,\n140, 150 and carnitine may lower the toxicity^241 of a potential Clostridial\nmetabolite (a derivative of propionic acid) that has been recovered in the\nurine of some individuals with ASD.^217 However, despite the potential\ntherapeutic nature of these compounds, systematic studies documenting the\nefficacy of these treatments for mitochondrial dysfunction in children with\nASD are generally lacking.\n\n### Limitations of this review and meta-analysis\n\nMany of the reviewed studies suffered from limitations. For example, most of\nthe studies that examined the prevalence of abnormal biochemical markers of\nmitochondrial function in ASD were probably susceptible to referral bias. In\nfact, there was only one study that was population based to prevent referral\nbias.^132, 133 In addition, most of the studies examining the abnormal\nprevalence or the difference in the values of biochemical markers were based\non a limited sample size (that is, <100 patients) and some studies did not\ncontain a control group and/or were retrospective in nature.\n\nAdditionally, studies describing children with ASD/MD were based on small case\nseries or isolated case reports and demonstrated variability in the protocols\nused for selecting children for MD workup, collecting biochemical markers of\nmitochondrial dysfunction, and defining MD. In fact, only 39% of the ASD/MD\nstudies reviewed noted the criterion used for diagnosing MD. The lack of a\nstandard criterion for diagnosing MD likely resulted in a heterogeneous\npopulation with varying degrees of mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition,\nmany of the characteristics found to be more prevalent in ASD/MD are features\nof the criteria generally used to diagnose MD, suggesting that the clinical\ncriteria could have influenced which children were selected to undergo\nevaluation for MD. Furthermore, most studies only examined a limited number of\nbiochemical markers of mitochondrial dysfunction and contained too few\nparticipants to examine the interrelationship(s) between these markers. More\nstudies are needed to determine how well the reviewed biochemical markers of\nmitochondrial dysfunction correlate with actual MD in children with ASD. For\nexample, comparing biochemical markers (such as lactate and carnitine) with\nmeasurements of ETC activity, mtDNA abnormalities and other mitochondrial\nabnormalities would be helpful in examining this further.\n\nTwo of the three studies examining the prevalence of MD in children with ASD\nused only lactate to identify candidates for further workup.^115, 132 It is\nlikely that many of the ASD/MD case studies also used lactate as the primary\nbiomarker to pursue a further workup for MD. Since cases have been reported in\nwhich biomarkers other than lactate are elevated in MD, it is likely that\nstudies which identified candidates for additional workup of MD using only\nlactate as a criterion overlooked some patients with MD. In addition, it is\nunclear whether using strict criteria for diagnosing MD may eliminate ASD\nchildren who have mild mitochondrial dysfunction such as partial complex\ndeficiencies.\n\nIn this review, we compared the prevalence of several clinical and biochemical\ncharacteristics between children with ASD/MD and two other clinical groups:\nchildren with MD and the general ASD population. The characteristics of these\nother clinical groups were estimated by a separate literature review. It is\npossible that some of the studies of the general MD population may have\nincluded a percentage of children with unrecognized ASD, thereby biasing the\nprevalence of certain characteristics in the childhood MD population toward\nthe ASD/MD population. Although this percentage appears to be low from our\nreview of the childhood MD literature, there have not been any studies\nspecifically designed to estimate ASD prevalence in childhood MD. Similarly,\nsome studies of the general ASD population may have included children with\nunrecognized MD, leading to a similar bias. The most significant limitation in\ndefining and comparing the group of children with ASD/MD with other groups is\nthe uncertainty regarding whether there is a well-definable subset of ASD\nchildren with MD or whether mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD is best\nrepresented on a continuum, with a subset of ASD children having mild or\nmoderate mitochondrial dysfunction that does not fully meet the criteria for\nMD.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis found that abnormal biochemical\nmarkers of mitochondrial function are relatively common in the general\npopulation of children with ASD and that a relatively high percentage of\nchildren with ASD (\u223c5%) have MD. However, it is unclear whether the general\npopulation of children with ASD is best characterized as having a distinct\nsubgroup with mitochondrial dysfunction or as having a spectrum of\nmitochondrial dysfunction of differing severity. In this review, we examined\nthe common characteristics of all reported cases of ASD/MD and compared these\ncharacteristics with the general ASD population and to the general population\nof children with MD. This analysis suggested that the ASD/MD cases, as a\ngroup, had a greater prevalence of several clinical characteristics as\ncompared with the general population of ASD, and a similar prevalence to\nchildren with MD in many clinical and biochemical characteristics. However, an\nexamination of the reviewed studies indicates that the methods for identifying\nand diagnosing MD need better characterization before a more precise group of\nASD/MD can be defined.\n\nAt this point, it is not clear if mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the\ndevelopment or pathogenesis of ASD or if it is merely an epiphenomenon of ASD.\nSeveral metabolic abnormalities and/or exposures to environmental toxicants\ncould result in secondary mitochondrial dysfunction in children with ASD, or\nthese factors could worsen mild mitochondrial dysfunction in some children,\ntransforming mild dysfunction into more severe dysfunction. Some children\ndemonstrated regression into ASD and MD following fever, suggesting children\nwho develop MD may be vulnerable to external factors causing regression into\nASD in children who may already have existing, but unidentified, MD. This\nsuggests that it is important for children with MD to be identified early in\nlife. Identification and longitudinal evaluation of the development of such\nindividuals will allow investigators to better understand how mitochondrial\ndysfunction may be related to the development of ASD. In the meantime, until\nfurther studies can be performed, a reasonable approach to ASD includes a\nworkup for MD and possible treatment with antioxidants and mitochondrial\ncofactors.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
