Although tourism accounts for about 35% of the archipelago\u2019s GDP\n\u2013 bringing in \u20ac16.9bn in 2022 alone \u2013 local people say the industry is\nstressing natural resources and pricing them out of the rental market.\n\nFigures from Spain\u2019s National Statistics Institute show that 33.8% of people\nin the Canaries are at risk of poverty or social exclusion, the highest\nproportion for any region except Andaluc\u00eda.\n\nMart\u00edn said the regional government\u2019s continuing focus on tourism at a time\nwhen the climate emergency was leading to cuts to water supplies made no\nsense. \u201cDemand [for water] is rising in urban areas where there are more\ntourists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very dry winter and a water emergency\u2019s\nalready been declared on Tenerife.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be restrictions if there\u2019s not more rain this month but\nit\u2019s 36C here right now. This is all unsustainable and it means that we won\u2019t\neven be able to keep normal levels of tourism going. And yet the authorities\nand the businesses here are trying to stick with this model.\u201d\n\nMart\u00edn added that the housing situation in many parts of the archipelago was\nalso dire because of high prices, low wages, a lack of public housing and the\ncontinuing cost of living crisis. \u201cI realised we\u2019d reached the limit when I\nsaw people who were working as hotel maids or waiters were living in shacks,\u201d\nhe said.\n\n\u201cWages are so low that they don\u2019t cover the basic costs of living \u2013 especially\nin the current crisis, which is global, but has been felt keenly in the\nCanaries because we have to import practically everything.\u201d\n\nHe insisted the protest movement was not anti-tourist, pointing out that many\npeople in the Canaries had known and liked generations of families from\ncountries such as the UK and Germany.\n\n\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the tourists,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a model that was built around\n\u2013 and with the connivance of \u2013 a business class that doesn\u2019t want to listen to\nwhat needs to be done, and with a political class that serves that business\nclass instead of serving all the citizens.\u201d\n\nHe said a complete rethinking of the Canaries\u2019 tourism model could not wait.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re asking is very simple: given that tourism is the main economic\nactivity and the cause of all these problems, we want an immediate halt to\nthese two mega-projects,\u201d he said of the Tenerife developments.\n\n\u201cWe also want a tourist moratorium that will lead to a study of the load each\nisland can take and which will determine whether we\u2019ve already passed the\ncritical point. In areas where there\u2019s an overload, we want to see a stage of\ndegrowth of economic activity to benefit natural resources. Otherwise, you\nhave an existing model that only benefits a very few people.\u201d\n\nMart\u00edn said a proper study of the problems the Canaries suffers from could\nhave global repercussions. \u201cThis rethinking of the tourism model could put the\nCanaries on the map as an example of sustainable tourism development,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cWe could be known for something positive instead of something\nnegative.\u201d\n\nFernando Clavijo, the regional president of the Canary islands, has said his\ngovernment is already taking action. \u201cAll the actions this government has\ntaken have been based on a revision of this model,\u201d he told reporters this\nweek. \u201cThe Canaries tourist model has been a successful one, but obviously, as\nwith anything, there are things that could be perfected.\u201d\n\nOvertourism has become a major issue in many Spanish cities and regions,\ntriggering protests and backlashes in Barcelona, and leading the authorities\nin Seville to consider charging visitors to explore the Andaluc\u00edan city\u2019s\nfamous Plaza de Espa\u00f1a.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Spain\n  * Protest\n  * Europe\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
