The effort also builds on the\nBiden-Harris Administration\u2019s ongoing work to leverage the benefits of science\nand technology for everyone in America.\n\nOSTP and our federal partners have selected five challenge project submissions\nas \u201cChampions of Open Science\u201d for their work to promote open science to\ntackle a unique problem. From overcoming the climate crisis by restoring our\nrelationship with nature to achieving better health outcomes in communities\nacross the United States, the winners exemplify what\u2019s possible with an open,\nequitable, and secure research enterprise. A list of winning projects is\nbelow. More information about the winning submissions can be found here.\n\nOpen Science to Serve Communities\n\nCo-developing tools for sharing Arctic Indigenous Knowledge\n\nBy opening up the processes and products of research to all, open science can\nbuild bridges between teams of researchers and members of diverse communities\nacross the country and around the world. This bridge building can ground\nresearch questions in local challenges, while creating opportunities for\ncommunities to contribute to the research process, co-creating evidence-driven\nsolutions. The Exchange for Local Observations and Knowledge of the Arctic\n(ELOKA) project exemplifies this power.\n\nIn response to significant environmental and social changes, Arctic residents\nhave been collecting and safeguarding data to address issues of critical\nimportance to their communities and families, including observations of\nenvironmental change, Indigenous place names, and oral histories and cultural\nknowledge of Elders. ELOKA was established to work directly with Indigenous\npartners across the Arctic to facilitate the ethical sharing and use of these\ndata. ELOKA\u2019s efforts to leverage open science and relationship building have\nadvanced our understanding of Arctic sciences, place-based knowledge, and\nsupport the self-determination of Arctic Indigenous peoples.\n\nFederal Support: Funding support from the National Science Foundation (NSF)\n\nOpen Science to Advance Global Solutions\n\nCuring childhood cancer: Transforming human health through data\n\nOpen science can enable collaborations that facilitate the responsible\nexchange of data and workflows to unlock advancements to some of the world\u2019s\nmost pressing challenges. For rare diseases like pediatric cancer, advances\ncan only be made by bringing together data from all over the world.\n\nThe Pediatric Cancer Data Commons (PCDC) at the University of Chicago has\ncreated the world\u2019s largest international sharing platform for data from kids\nwith cancer. The PCDC aims to increase access to high-quality data to study\npediatric cancer and to learn better ways to diagnose and treat these\nchildren. They began their goal of building a world-accessible data commons\nwith neuroblastoma data and have since expanded into other disease groups,\nincluding predisposition syndromes and data from long-term follow-up care.\n\nPCDC\u2019s efforts to grow this vitally important knowledge base, while advancing\nthe goals of the Cancer Moonshot, through a commitment to relationship-\nbuilding, data quality, and sustainability will continue to enable\nresearchers, clinicians, patients, and their loved ones to push the boundaries\nof research and improve health.\n\nFederal Support: Funding support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n\nOpen Science to Advance Innovation\n\nZooniverse: Harnessing the power of 2.6 million people for open science\n\nOpen science has the power to broaden participation in the process of\ndiscovery, empowering community members to engage in and contribute to\nresearch and innovation.\n\nA team of astronomers and museum specialists at Chicago\u2019s Adler Planetarium\nand Oxford University recognized this potential to solve the challenge of\nprocessing and analyzing massive datasets, which can slow the pace of\ndiscovery. They came together to develop Zooniverse: an open-source platform\nthat would allow anyone with an internet connection to participate in\ncrowdsourced scientific research. Since 2007, Zooniverse has become the\nlargest online open data platform for people-powered research, enabling\nvolunteers from around the globe to contribute to data collection and analysis\non a wide array of topics\u2014marking cell structure for cancer research,\ntranscribing historic documents to tagging animals, discovering planets, and\nmore. With over 2.6 million registered users across 90 active projects,\nresearchers can collaborate with diverse audiences, while building bridges\nbetween the research enterprise and communities around the globe. Zooniverse\u2019s\nefforts to develop an innovative solution to unlocking insights from large\ndatasets, have engaged millions of volunteers of all ages and backgrounds.\n\nFederal Support: Funding support from NSF, NASA, NOAA, NIH, the National\nEndowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services\n\nOpen Science to Advance Education\n\nFoodMASTER: Open science advances education\n\nOpen science can enable researchers to reach wider audiences with a range of\ngoals, including creating educational opportunities in science, technology,\nengineering, and math (STEM) fields.\n\nIn 1999, an elementary school teacher and a faculty member at the Ohio State\nUniversity teamed up to develop open curricular materials for students in\nrural communities around a topic of special importance and relevance to us\nall: food. By using a common experience as a teaching tool, the collaborators\nsought to make mathematics and science education more accessible to a wide\nrange of learners. The collaboration grew into the Food, Math, and Science\nTeaching Enhancement Resource (FoodMASTER) Initiative, with open curricular\nmaterials to support active learning methods for an applied approach to\nmicrobiology, chemistry, biology, nutrition, mathematics, health, and more\ndesigned for grades 3-5, 6-8, high school, and higher education. FoodMASTER\u2019s\nefforts help tap into the universal power of food to create open educational\nexperiences that can reach diverse communities of students across the country.\n\nFederal Support: Funding support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\nand the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)\n\nTechnical Advancement to Enable Open Science\n\nProject Jupyter: Reproducible and collaborative computational science and\neducation\n\nOpen science relies on technical advancements and infrastructures that enable\nthe flow of information between different communities of users\u2014researchers,\neducators, students, data journalists, community advocates, and more.\n\nMore than 20 years ago, researchers at the University of California Berkeley\nand Cal Poly San Luis Obispo launched Project Jupyter, an open-source\ninteractive computational tool that allows users to create and share documents\ncapturing code narrative descriptions, equations, and visualizations. Since\nthen, Project Jupyter has grown into an open, international, and multi-\nstakeholder community of contributors across academia, industry, education,\nand beyond. Jupyter and its community of contributors have continued to grow a\nculture of collaboration in education.\n\nFederal Support: Funding support from NSF and the U.S. Department of Energy\n\n###\n\n## Stay Connected\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.\n\nShare\n\n  * Share this page on Facebook\n  * Share this page on X\n  * https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/03/21/white-house-office-of-science-technology-policy-announces-year-of-open-science-recognition-challenge-winners/?utm_source=link\n\nThe White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500\n\nWH.gov\n\nScroll to Top\n\nTop\n\n", "frontpage": false}
