Simple and safe to make, it leads\nnovice picklers to more offbeat practices.Illustration by Barry Blitt\n\nThe house at 40 Congress Street wouldn\u2019t have been my first choice for lunch.\nIt sat on a weedy lot in a dishevelled section of Asheville, North Carolina.\nAbandoned by its previous owners, condemned by the city, and minimally\nrehabilitated, it was occupied\u2014perhaps infested is a better word\u2014by a loose\naffiliation of opportunivores. The walls and ceilings, chicken coop and solar\noven were held together with scrap lumber and drywall. The sinks, disconnected\nfrom the sewer, spilled their effluent into plastic buckets, providing water\nfor root crops in the gardens. The whole compound was painted a sickly\ngreenish gray\u2014the unhappy marriage of twenty-three cans of surplus paint from\nHome Depot. \u201cWe didn\u2019t put in the pinks,\u201d Clover told me.\n\nClover\u2019s pseudonym both signalled his emancipation from a wasteful society and\noffered a thin buffer against its authorities. \u201cIt came out of the security\nculture of the old Earth First! days,\u201d another opportunivore told me. \u201cIf the\nMan comes around, you can\u2019t give him any incriminating information.\u201d Mostly,\nthough, the names fit the faces: Clover was pale, slender, and sweet-natured,\nwith fine blond hair gathered in a bun. His neighbor Catfish had droopy\nwhiskers and fleshy cheeks. There were four men and three women in all, aged\ntwenty to thirty-five, crammed into seven small bedrooms. Only one had a full-\ntime job, and more than half received food stamps. They relied mostly on\nsecondhand bicycles for transportation, and each paid two hundred dollars or\nless in rent. \u201cWe\u2019re just living way simple,\u201d Clover said. \u201cSuper low-impact,\ndeep green.\u201d\n\nAlong one wall of the kitchen, rows of pine and wire shelves were crowded with\ndumpster discoveries, most of them pristine: boxes of organic tea and\nartisanal pasta, garlic from Food Lion, baby spring mix from Earth Fare,\ntomatoes from the farmers\u2019 market. About half the household\u2019s food had been\nleft somewhere to rot, Clover said, and there was often enough to share with\nAsheville\u2019s other opportunivores. (A couple of months earlier, they\u2019d\nunearthed a few dozen cartons of organic ice cream; before that, enough\nOdwalla juices to fill the bathtub.) Leftovers were pickled or composted,\nbrewed into mead or, if they looked too dicey, fed to the chickens. \u201cWe have\nour standards,\u201d a young punk with a buzz-cut scalp and a skinny ponytail told\nme. \u201cWe won\u2019t dumpster McDonald\u2019s.\u201d But he had eaten a good deal of scavenged\nsushi, he said\u2014it was all right, as long as it didn\u2019t sit in the dumpster\novernight\u2014and his housemate had once scored a haggis. \u201cOh no, no,\u201d she said,\nwhen I asked if she\u2019d eaten it. \u201cIt was canned.\u201d\n\nLunch that day was lentil soup, a bowl of which was slowly congealing on the\ntable in front of me. The carrots and onions in it had come from a dumpster\nbehind Amazing Savings, as had the lentils, potatoes, and most of the spices.\nTheir color reminded me a little of the paint on the house. Next to me, Sandor\nKatz scooped a spoonful into his mouth and declared it excellent. A self-\navowed \u201cfermentation fetishist,\u201d Katz travels around the country giving\nlectures and demonstrations, spreading the gospel of sauerkraut, dill pickles,\nand all foods transformed and ennobled by bacteria. His two books\u2014\u201cWild\nFermentation\u201d and \u201cThe Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved\u201d\u2014have become\nmanifestos and how-to manuals for a generation of underground food activists,\nand he\u2019s at work on a third, definitive volume. Lunch with the opportunivores\nwas his idea.\n\nKatz and I were on our way to the Green Path, a gathering of herbalists,\nforagers, raw-milk drinkers, and roadkill eaters in the foothills of the Smoky\nMountains. The groups in Katz\u2019s network have no single agenda or ideology.\nSome identify themselves as punks, others as hippies, others as evangelical\nChristians; some live as rustically as homesteaders\u2014the \u201ctechno-peasantry,\u201d\nthey call themselves; others are thoroughly plugged in. If they have a\nconnecting thread, it\u2019s their distrust of \u201cdead, anonymous, industrialized,\ngenetically engineered, and chemicalized corporate food,\u201d as Katz has written.\nAmericans are killing themselves with cleanliness, he believes. Every year, we\nwaste forty per cent of the food we produce, and process, pasteurize, or\nirradiate much of the rest, sterilizing the live cultures that keep us\nhealthy. Lunch from a dumpster isn\u2019t just a form of conservation; it\u2019s a kind\nof inoculation.\n\n\u201cThis is a modern version of the ancient tradition of gleaning,\u201d Katz said.\n\u201cWhen the harvest is over, the community has a common-law right to pick over\nwhat\u2019s left.\u201d I poked at the soup with my spoon. The carrots seemed a little\nsoft\u2014whether overcooked or overripe, I couldn\u2019t tell\u2014but they tasted all\nright. I asked the kid with the ponytail if he\u2019d ever brought home food that\nwas spoiled. \u201cOh, hell yes!\u201d he said, choking back a laugh. \u201cJesus Christ,\nyes!\u201d Then he shrugged, suddenly serious. \u201cIt happens: diarrhea, food\npoisoning. But I think we\u2019ve developed pretty good immune systems by now.\u201d\n\nTo most cooks, a kitchen is a kind of battle zone\u2014a stainless-steel arena\ndevoted to the systematic destruction of bacteria. We fry them in oil and\nroast them in ovens, steam them, boil them, and sluice them with detergents.\nOur bodies are delicate things, easily infected, our mothers taught us, and\nthe agents of microscopic villainy are everywhere. They lurk in raw meat, raw\nvegetables, and the yolks of raw eggs, on the unwashed hand and in the\nunmuffled sneeze, on the grimy countertop and in the undercooked pork chop.\n\nOr maybe not. Modern hygiene has prevented countless colds, fevers, and other\nailments, but its central premise is hopelessly outdated. The human body isn\u2019t\nbesieged; it\u2019s saturated, infused with microbial life at every level. \u201cThere\nis no such thing as an individual,\u201d Lynn Margulis, a biologist at the\nUniversity of Massachusetts at Amherst, told me recently. \u201cWhat we see as\nanimals are partly just integrated sets of bacteria.\u201d Nearly all the DNA in\nour bodies belongs to microorganisms: they outnumber our own cells nine to\none. They process the nutrients in our guts, produce the chemicals that\ntrigger sleep, ferment the sweat on our skin and the glucose in our muscles.\n(\u201cHumans didn\u2019t invent fermentation,\u201d Katz likes to say. \u201cFermentation created\nus.\u201d) They work with the immune system to mediate chemical reactions and drive\nout the most common infections. Even our own cells are kept alive by\nmitochondria\u2014the tiny microbial engines in their cytoplasm. Bacteria are us.\n\n\u201cMicrobes are the minimal units, the basic building blocks of life on earth,\u201d\nMargulis said. About half a billion years ago, land vertebrates began to\nencase themselves in skin and their embryos in protective membranes, sealing\noff the microbes inside them and fostering ever more intimate relations with\nthem. Humans are the acme of that evolution\u2014walking, talking microbial vats.\nBy now, the communities we host are so varied and interdependent that it\u2019s\nhard to tell friend from enemy\u2014the bacteria we can\u2019t live with from those we\ncan\u2019t live without. E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and the bacteria\nresponsible for meningitis and stomach ulcers all live peaceably inside us\nmost of the time, turning dangerous only on rare occasions and for reasons\nthat are poorly understood. \u201cThis clich\u00e9 nonsense about good and bad bacteria,\nit\u2019s so insidious,\u201d Margulis said. \u201cIt\u2019s this Western, dichotomized, Cartesian\nthing. . . . Like Jesus rising.\u201d\n\nIn the past decade, biologists have embarked on what they call the second\nhuman-genome project, aimed at identifying every bacterium associated with\npeople. More than a thousand species have been found so far in our skin,\nstomach, mouth, guts, and other body parts. Of those, only fifty or so are\nknown to harm us, and they have been studied obsessively for more than a\ncentury. The rest are mostly new to science. \u201cAt this juncture, biologists\ncannot be blamed for finding themselves in a kind of \u2018future shock,\u2019 \u201d\nMargaret McFall-Ngai, an expert in symbiosis at the University of Wisconsin at\nMadison, wrote in Nature Reviews Microbiology two years ago. Or, as she put it\nin an earlier essay, \u201cWe have been looking at bacteria through the wrong end\nof the telescope.\u201d\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nGiven how little we know about our inner ecology, carpet-bombing it might not\nalways be the best idea. \u201cI would put it very bluntly,\u201d Margulis told me.\n\u201cWhen you advocate your soaps that say they kill all harmful bacteria, you are\ncommitting suicide.\u201d The bacteria in the gut can take up to four years to\nrecover from a round of antibiotics, recent studies have found, and the steady\nassault of detergents, preservatives, chlorine, and other chemicals also takes\nits toll. The immune system builds up fewer antibodies in a sterile\nenvironment; the deadliest pathogens can grow more resistant to antibiotics;\nand innocent bystanders such as peanuts or gluten are more likely to provoke\nallergic reactions. All of which may explain why a number of studies have\nfound that children raised on farms are less susceptible to allergies, asthma,\nand autoimmune diseases. The cleaner we are, it sometimes seems, the sicker we\nget.\n\n\u201cWe are living in this cultural project that\u2019s rarely talked about,\u201d Katz\nsays. \u201cWe hear about the war on terror. We hear about the war on drugs. But\nthe war on bacteria is much older, and we\u2019ve all been indoctrinated into it.\nWe have to let go of the idea that they\u2019re our enemies.\u201d Eating bacteria is\none of life\u2019s great pleasures, Katz says. Beer, wine, cheese, bread, cured\nmeats, coffee, chocolate: our best-loved foods are almost all fermented. They\nstart out bitter, bland, cloying, or indigestible and are remade by microbes\ninto something magnificent.\n\nFermentation is a biochemical magic trick\u2014a benign form of rot. It\u2019s best\nknown as the process by which yeast turns sugar into alcohol, but an array of\nother microorganisms and foods can ferment as well. In some fish dishes, for\ninstance, the resident bacteria digest amino acids and spit out ammonia, which\nacts as a preservative. Strictly speaking, all fermentation is anaerobic (it\ndoesn\u2019t consume oxygen); most rot is aerobic. But the two are separated less\nby process than by product. One makes food healthy and delicious; the other\nnot so much.\n\nMaking peace with microorganisms has its risks, of course. E. coli can kill\nyou. Listeria can kill you. Basic hygiene and antibiotic overkill aren\u2019t hard\nto tell apart at home, but the margin of error shrinks dramatically in a\nfactory. Less than a gram of the bacterial toxin that causes botulism,\nreleased into the American milk supply, could poison a hundred thousand\npeople, the National Academy of Sciences estimated in 2005. And recent deaths\nand illnesses from contaminated beef, spinach, and eggs have persuaded food\nregulators to clamp down even harder. While Katz\u2019s followers embrace their\nbacterial selves, the Obama Administration has urged Congress to pass a\ncomprehensive new set of food-safety laws, setting the stage for a culture war\nof an unusually literal sort. \u201cThis is a revolution of the everyday,\u201d Katz\nsays, \u201cand it\u2019s already happening.\u201d\n\nWhen Katz picked me up in Knoxville at the beginning of our road trip, the\nback seat of his rented Kia was stacked with swing-top bottles and oversized\nMason jars. They were filled with foamy, semi-opaque fluids and shredded\nvegetables that had been fermenting in his kitchen for weeks. A sour,\npleasantly funky aroma pervaded the cabin, masking the new-car smell of\nindustrial cleaners and off-gassing plastics. It was like driving around in a\npickle barrel.\n\nPhysically speaking, food activists tend to present a self-negating argument.\nThe more they insist on healthy eating the unhealthier they look. The pickier\nthey are about food the more they look like they could use a double\ncheeseburger. Katz was an exception. At forty-eight, he had clear blue eyes, a\ntightly wound frame, and ropy forearms. His hands were calloused and his skin\nwas ruddy from hours spent weeding his commune\u2019s vegetable patches and herding\nits goats. He wore his hair in a stubby Mohawk, his beard in bushy\nmuttonchops. If not for his multiple earrings and up-to-the-minute scientific\narguments, he might have seemed like a figure out of the nineteenth century,\nselling tonics and bromides from a painted wagon.\n\nKatz was a political activist long before he was a fermentation fetishist.\nGrowing up on New York\u2019s Upper West Side, the eldest son of progressive Polish\nand Lithuanian Jews, he was always involved in one campaign or another. At the\nage of ten, in 1972, he spent his afternoons on street corners handing out\nbuttons for George McGovern. At eleven, he was a campaign volunteer for the\nmayoral candidate Al Blumenthal. When he reached sixth grade and found that\none of the city\u2019s premier programs for gifted students, Hunter College High\nSchool, was only for girls, he helped bring an anti-discrimination suit that\nforced it to turn coed. He later served on the student council with Elena\nKagan, the future Supreme Court Justice. \u201cThe staggered lunch hour was our big\nissue,\u201d he says.\n\nLink copied\n\nAt Brown, as an undergraduate, Katz became a well-known figure: a bearish\nhippie in the Abbie Hoffman mold, with a huge head of curly hair. His causes\nwere standard issue for the time: gay rights, divestment from South Africa,\nU.S. out of Central America (as a senior, he and a group of fellow-activists\nplaced a C.I.A. recruiter under citizen\u2019s arrest). Yet Katz lacked the usual\nstridency of the campus radical. \u201cI remember a particular conversation in 1982\nor \u201983,\u201d his classmate Alicia Svigals, who went on to found the band the\nKlezmatics, told me. \u201cWe were standing on a street corner in Providence, and I\nsaid, \u2018Sandy, I think I might be a lesbian.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Oh, I think I might\nbe gay.\u2019 At the time, that was a huge piece of news. It wasn\u2019t something you\nsaid lightly. But his reaction was \u2018How wonderful and exciting! How fantastic!\nThis is going to be so much fun!\u2019 The world was about to be made new\u2014and so\neasily.\u201d\n\nAfter graduation, Katz moved back to New York. He took a job as the executive\ndirector of Westpride, a lobbying group opposed to a massive development\nproject on the Upper West Side. (The developer, Donald Trump, was eventually\nforced to scale down his plans.) As the AIDS epidemic escalated, in the late\neighties, Katz became an organizer for ACT UP and a columnist for the magazine\nOutWeek. His efforts on both fronts caught the eye of Ruth Messinger, the\nManhattan borough president, who hired him in 1989 as a land-use planner and\nas a de-facto liaison to the gay community. \u201cHe was a spectacular person,\u201d\nMessinger told me recently. \u201cCreative and flamboyant and fun to be around. He\njust had a natural instinct and talent as an organizer of people.\u201d Messinger\nwas thinking of running for mayor (she won the Democratic nomination in 1997,\nonly to get trounced by Rudolph Giuliani), and Katz\u2019s ambitions rose with\nhers. \u201cI would fantasize about what city agency I wanted to administer,\u201d he\nrecalls. Then, in 1991, he found out he was H.I.V.-positive.\n\nKatz had never been particularly promiscuous. He\u2019d had his first gay sexual\nexperience at the age of twenty-one, crossing the country on a Green Tortoise\nbus, and had returned to New York just as its bathhouse days were waning. He\u2019d\nnever taken intravenous drugs and had avoided the riskiest sexual activities.\nThe previous H.I.V. tests he\u2019d taken had come back inconclusive\u2014perhaps, he\nreasoned, because of a malarial infection that he\u2019d picked up in West Africa.\n\u201cI have no idea how it happened,\u201d he told me. \u201cI remember walking out of the\ndoctor\u2019s office in such a daze. I was just utterly shell-shocked.\u201d\n\nThe virus wasn\u2019t necessarily a death sentence, though an effective treatment\nwas years away. But it did transform Katz\u2019s political ambitions. \u201cThey just\ndematerialized,\u201d he told me. For all his iconoclasm, he had always dreamed of\nbeing a United States senator. Now he focussed on curing himself. He cut back\nhis hours and moved from his parents\u2019 apartment to the East Village. So many\nof his friends had died while on AZT and other experimental drugs that he\ndecided to search for alternatives. He had already taken up yoga and switched\nto a macrobiotic diet. Now he began to consult with herbalists, drink nettle\ntea, and wander around Central Park gathering medicinal plants. \u201cI got skinny,\nskinny, skinny,\u201d he says. \u201cMy friends thought I was wasting away.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s relentless energy had always helped drive his ambitions, but now he\nfound that it wore him out. About a year after his diagnosis, Katz went to\nvisit some friends in New Orleans who had rented a crash pad for Mardi Gras.\nAmong the characters there, he met a man from a place near Nashville called\nHickory Knoll (I\u2019ve changed the name at Katz\u2019s request). Founded in the early\nseventies by a group of back-to-the-landers, Hickory Knoll was something of a\nlegend in the gay community: a queer sanctuary in the heart of the Bible Belt.\n\u201cI was a typical New Yorker,\u201d Katz says. \u201cI considered the idea of living in\nTennessee absurd.\u201d Still, he was intrigued. Hickory Knoll had no television or\nhot running water\u2014just goats, vegetable gardens, and gay men. Maybe it was\njust what he needed.\n\nHickory Knoll lies just up the road from a Bible camp, in an airy forest of\ntulip poplar and dogwood, maple, mountain laurel, pawpaw, and persimmon. The\ncamp and the commune share a hilltop, a telephone cable, and, if nothing else,\na belief in spiritual renewal: \u201cWant a new life?\u201d a sign in front of a local\nchurch asked as I drove past. \u201cGod accepts trade-ins.\u201d When Katz first\narrived, in the spring of 1992, the paulownia trees were in bloom, scattering\nthe ground with lavender petals. As he walked down the gravel path, the forest\ncanopy opened up and a cabin of hand-hewn chestnut logs, built in the\neighteen-thirties, appeared in the sunlight below. \u201cIt was a beautiful\narrival,\u201d he says.\n\nThe commune had a shifting cast of about fifteen members, some of whom had\nlived there for decades. It billed itself as a radical faerie sanctuary,\nthough the term was notoriously slippery\u2014the faerie movement, begun in the\nlate seventies by gay-rights activists, embraced everyone from transvestites\nto pagans and anarchists, their common interest being a focus on nature and\nspirituality. Street kids from San Francisco, nudists from Nashville, a\nMexican minister coming out of the closet: all found their way, somehow, to\ncentral Tennessee. Most were gay men, though anyone was welcome, and the great\nmajority had never lived on the land before. \u201cSissies in the wood,\u201d one writer\ncalled it, after tussling over camping arrangements with a drag queen in four-\ninch heels.\n\nNew arrivals stayed in the cabin \u201cdowntown,\u201d which had been fitfully expanded\nto encompass a library, living room, dining room, and kitchen, with four\nbedrooms upstairs. Farther down the path were a swaybacked red barn, a\ncommunal shower, a pair of enormous onion-domed cisterns, and a four-seater\nouthouse. The charge for room and board was on a sliding scale starting at\nseventy-five dollars a month, with a tacit agreement, laxly enforced, to pitch\nin\u2014milking goats, mending fences, or just greeting new arrivals. Those who\nstayed eventually built houses along the ridges or bought adjacent land and\nstarted homesteads and communes of their own. In the spring, at the annual May\nDay celebration, their numbers grew to several hundred. \u201cThe gayborhood just\nkeeps on growing,\u201d Weeder, Hickory Knoll\u2019s oldest member, told me one evening\nas we were sitting on the front porch of the cabin. \u201cWe\u2019re a pretty good\nvoting bloc.\u201d\n\nInside, half a dozen men were preparing dinner. Food is the great marker of\nthe day at Hickory Knoll\u2014the singular goal toward which most labor and\ncreativity tend. On my visit, the kitchen seemed to be staffed by at least\nthree cooks at all times, cutting biscuits, baking vegan meat loaf, washing\nkale; one of them, a gangly Oklahoman named Lady Now, worked in the nude.\n\u201cReal estate determines culture,\u201d Katz likes to say, and the maxim is doubly\ntrue among underground food movements. Urban squatters gravitate toward\nfreeganism and dumpster diving, homesteaders toward raw milk and roadkill. At\nHickory Knoll, the slow pace, lush gardens, and communal isolation are natural\nincubators for fermented food, though Katz didn\u2019t realize it right away. \u201cIt\ntook a while for the New York City to wear off,\u201d Weeder told me.\n\u201cOveranalyzing everything. Where am I going to go tonight? There really is\nnowhere to go.\u201d\n\nThat first year, a visitor named Crazy Owl brought some miso as barter for his\nstay, inspiring Katz to make some of his own. Miso, like many Asian staples,\nis usually made of fermented soybeans. The beans are hard to stomach alone, no\nmatter how long they\u2019re cooked. But once inoculated with koji\u2014the spores of\nthe Aspergillus oryzae mold\u2014they become silken and delicious. The enzymes in\nthe mold predigest the beans, turning starches into sugars, breaking proteins\ninto amino acids, unlocking nutrients from leaden compounds. A lowly bean\nbecomes one of the world\u2019s great foods.\n\nKatz experimented with more and more fermented dishes after that. He made\ntempeh, natto, kombucha, and kefir. He recruited friends to chew corn for\nchicha\u2014an Andean beer brewed with the enzymes in human saliva. At the\nVanderbilt library, in Nashville, he worked his way through the \u201cHandbook of\nIndigenous Fermented Foods\u201d (1983), by the Cornell microbiologist Keith\nSteinkraus. When he\u2019d gathered a few dozen recipes, he printed a pamphlet and\nsold some copies to a bookstore in Maine and a permaculture magazine in North\nCarolina. The pamphlet led toa contract from a publisher, Chelsea Green, and\nthe release of \u201cWild Fermentation,\u201d in 2003. The book was only a modest\nsuccess at first, but sold more copies each year\u2014some seventy thousand in all.\nSoon Katz was crisscrossing the country in his car, shredding cabbage in the\naisles of Whole Foods or Trader Joe\u2019s, preaching the glories of sauerkraut.\n\n\u201cFermented foods aren\u2019t culinary novelties,\u201d he told me one morning. \u201cThey\naren\u2019t cupcakes. They\u2019re a major survival food.\u201d We were standing in his test\nkitchen, in the basement of a farmhouse a few miles down the road from Hickory\nKnoll. Katz had rented the space two years earlier, when his classes and\ncooking projects outgrew the commune\u2019s kitchen, and outfitted it with\nsecondhand equipment: a triple sink, a six-burner stove, a freezer, and two\nrefrigerators, one of them retrofitted as a tempeh incubator. Along one wall,\na friend had painted a psychedelic mural showing a man conversing with a\nbacterium. Along another, Katz had pinned a canticle to wild fermentation,\nwritten by a Benedictine nun in New York. A haunch of venison hung in back,\ncuring for prosciutto, surrounded by mismatched jars of sourdough, goat kefir,\nsweet potato fly, and other ferments, all bubbling and straining at their\nlids. \u201cIt\u2019s like having pets,\u201d Katz said.\n\nThe kitchen had the same aroma as Katz\u2019s car, only a few orders of magnitude\nfunkier: the smell of life before cold storage. \u201cWe are living in the\nhistorical bubble of refrigeration,\u201d Katz said, pulling a jar of bright-pink-\nand-orange sauerkraut off the shelf. \u201cMost of these food movements aren\u2019t\nrevolutionary so much as conservative. They want to bring back the way food\nhas been.\u201d\n\nFermentation, like cooking with fire, is one of the initial conditions of\ncivilization. The alcohol and acids it produces can preserve fruits and grains\nfor months and even years, making sedentary society possible. The first\nferments happened by accident\u2014honey water turned to mead, grapes to\nvinegar\u2014but people soon learned to re-create them. By 5400 B.C., the ancient\nIranians were making wine. By 1800 B.C., the Sumerians were worshipping\nNinkasi, the goddess of beer. By the first century B.C., the Chinese were\nmaking a precursor to soy sauce.\n\nKatz calls fermentation the path of least resistance. \u201cIt\u2019s what happens when\nyou do nothing,\u201d he says. Or, rather, if you do one or two simple things. A\nhead of cabbage left on a counter will never turn to sauerkraut, no matter how\nlong it sits there. Yeasts, molds, and a host of bacteria will attack it,\ndigesting the leaves till all that\u2019s left is a puddle of black slime. To\nferment, most food has to be protected from the air. It can be sealed in a\nbarrel, stuffed in a casing, soaked in brine, or submerged in its own\njuices\u2014anything, as long as oxygen doesn\u2019t touch it. The sauerkraut Katz was\nholding had been made ten days earlier. I\u2019d watched him shred the cabbage\u2014one\nhead of red and one of green\u2014sprinkle it with two tablespoons of salt to draw\nout the water, and throw in a few grated carrots. He\u2019d scrunched everything\ntogether with his hands, to help release the juice, and packed it in a jar\nuntil the liquid rose to the top. \u201cI would suggest not sealing it too\ntightly,\u201d he said, as he clamped down the lid. \u201cSome jars will explode.\u201d\n\nThree waves of bacteria had colonized the kraut since then, each one changing\nthe chemical environment just enough to attract and fall victim to the\nnext\u2014like yuppie remodellers priced out of their own neighborhood. Sugars had\nbeen converted to acids, carbon dioxide, and alcohol. Some new nutrients had\nbeen created: B vitamins, for instance, and isothiocyanates, which laboratory\nstudies have found to inhibit lung, liver, breast, and other cancers. Other\nnutrients were preserved, notably Vitamin C. When Captain Cook circled the\nglobe between 1772 and 1775, he took along thirty thousand pounds of\nsauerkraut, and none of his crew died of scurvy.\n\nI tried a forkful from Katz\u2019s jar, along with a slab of his black-rice tempeh.\nThe kraut was crunchy and tart\u2014milder than any I\u2019d had from a store and much\nfresher tasting. \u201cYou could eat it after two weeks, you could eat it after two\nmonths, and if you lived in a cold environment and had a root cellar you could\neat it after two years,\u201d Katz said. The longer it fermented the stronger it\nwould get. His six-month-old kraut, made with radishes and Asian greens, was\nmeaty, pungent, and as tender as pasta\u2014the enzymes in it had broken down the\npectin in its cell walls. Some people like it that way, he said. \u201cWhen this\nAustrian woman tasted my six-week-old sauerkraut, she said, \u2018That\u2019s O.K.\u2014for\ncoleslaw.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLink copied\n\nWhile we were eating, the front door banged open and a young man walked in\ncarrying some baskets of fresh-picked strawberries. He had long blond hair and\nhands stained red with juice. His name was Jimmy, he said. He lived at Hickory\nKnoll but was doing some farming up the road. \u201cWe originally grew herbs and\nflowers and planted them in patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people were like, \u2018What\nare those patterns you\u2019re makin\u2019? They don\u2019t look Christian to me.\u2019 \u201d The\nlocals were usually pretty tolerant, Katz said. In eighteen years, the worst\nincidents that he could recall were a few slashed tires and some teen-agers\nyelling \u201cFaggots!\u201d from the road and shooting shotguns in the air. Rural\nTennessee is a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d sort of place, where privacy is the one\ninalienable right. But Jimmy\u2019s fancy crop might have counted as a public\ndisplay. He laughed and handed me a berry, still warm from the sun. \u201cThey\u2019re\nnot only organic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re grown with gay love.\u201d\n\nThe fruit was sugar-sweet and extravagantly fragrant\u2014a distillation of spring.\nBut the sauerkraut was the more trustworthy food. An unwashed fruit or\nvegetable may host as many as a million bacteria per gram, Fred Breidt, a\nmicrobiologist with the United States Department of Agriculture and a\nprofessor of food science at North Carolina State University, told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve\nall seen the cases,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThe runoff from agriculture gets onto a\nvegetable, or there\u2019s fecal matter from someone who handled it. Healthy people\nwill get diarrhea; an elderly person or a baby might get killed. That\u2019s a\npossibility with raw food.\u201d If the same produce were fermented, its native\nbacteria would drive off the pathogens, and the acids and alcohol they produce\nwould prevent any further infection. Breidt has yet to find a single\ndocumented case of someone getting sick from contaminated sauerkraut. \u201cIt\u2019s\nthe safest food there is,\u201d Katz said.\n\nSauerkraut is Katz\u2019s gateway drug. He lures in novices with its simplicity and\nsafety, then encourages them to experiment with livelier cultures, more\noffbeat practices. \u201cThe Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved\u201d moves from anodyne\ntopics such as seed saving and urban gardening to dirt eating, feral foraging,\ncannabis cookery, and the raw-milk underground. Unlike many food activists,\nKatz has a clear respect for peer-reviewed science and he prefaces each\ndiscussion with the appropriate caveats. Yet his message is clear: \u201cOur food\nsystem desperately demands subversion,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe more we sterilize our\nfood to eliminate all theoretical risk, the more we diminish its nutritional\nquality.\u201d\n\nOn the first day of our road trip, not long after our lunch with the\nopportunivores, Katz and I paid a visit to a man he called one of the kingpins\nof underground food in North Carolina. Garth, as I\u2019ll call him, was a pale,\nreedy figure in his fifties with wide, spectral eyes. His linen shirt and\nsuspenders hung slackly on his frame, and his sunken cheeks gave him the look\nof a hardscrabble farmer from a century ago. \u201cI was sick for seventeen years,\u201d\nhe told us. \u201cBlack circles under my eyes, weighed less than a hundred pounds.\nIt didn\u2019t seem like I\u2019d get very far.\u201d Doctors said that he had severe\nchemical sensitivities and a host of ailments\u2014osteoporosis, emphysema, edema,\npoor circulation\u2014but they seemed incapable of curing him. He tried veganism\nfor a while, but only got weaker. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a good diet for skinny\npeople,\u201d he said. So he went to the opposite extreme.\n\nInside his bright country kitchen, Garth carefully poured us each a glass of\nunpasteurized goat milk, as if proffering a magic elixir. The milk was pure\nwhite and thick as cream. It had a long, flowery bloom and a faint tanginess.\nRaw milk doesn\u2019t spoil like pasteurized milk. Its native bacteria, left to\nmultiply at room temperature, sour it into something like yogurt or\nbuttermilk, only much richer in cultures. It was the mainstay of Garth\u2019s diet,\nalong with raw butter, cream, and daily portions of raw liver, fish, chicken,\nor beef. He was still anything but robust, but he had enough energy to work\nlong hours in the garden for the first time in years. \u201cIt enabled me to\nfunction,\u201d he said.\n\nRaw milk brings the bacterial debate down to brass tacks. Drinking it could be\ngood for you. Then again it could kill you. Just where the line between risk\nand benefit lies is a matter of fierce dispute\u2014not to mention arrests,\nlawsuits, property seizures, and protest marches. In May, for instance, raw-\nmilk activists, hoping to draw attention to a recent crackdown by\nMassachusetts agricultural authorities, milked a Jersey cow on Boston Common\nand staged a drink-in.\n\nRetail sales of raw milk are illegal in most states, including North Carolina,\nbut people drink it anyway. Some dairy owners label the milk for pet\nconsumption only (though at two to five times the cost of pasteurized, it\u2019s\ntoo rich for most cats). Others sell it at farm stands or through herd-share\nprograms. In my neighborhood in Brooklyn, the raw-milk co\u00f6perative meets every\nmonth in the aisles of a gourmet deli. The milk is trucked in from\nPennsylvania\u2014a violation of federal law, which prohibits the interstate\ntransport of raw milk\u2014but no one seems to mind. Garth buys milk from a local\nfarmer and sells it out of his house. \u201cIt\u2019s illegal,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut it gets\nto the point where living is illegal.\u201d\n\nThe nutritional evidence both for and against raw milk is somewhat sketchy;\nmuch of it dates from before the Second World War, when raw milk was still\nlegal. The Food and Drug Administration, in a fact sheet titled \u201cThe Dangers\nof Raw Milk,\u201d insists that pasteurization \u201cDOES NOT reduce milk\u2019s nutritional\nvalue.\u201d The temperature of the process, well below the boiling point, is meant\nto kill pathogens and leave nutrients intact. Yet raw-milk advocacy groups,\nsuch as the Weston A. Price Foundation, in Washington, D.C., point to a number\nof studies that suggest the opposite. An array of vitamins, enzymes, and other\nnutrients are destroyed, diminished, or denatured by heat, they say. Lactase,\nfor instance, is an enzyme that breaks down lactose into simpler sugars that\nthe body can better digest. Raw milk often contains lactobacilli and\nbifidobacteria that produce lactase, but neither the bacteria nor the enzyme\ncan survive pasteurization. In one survey of raw-milk drinkers in Michigan and\nIllinois, eighty-two per cent of those who had been diagnosed as lactose\nintolerant could drink raw milk without digestive problems. (A more extreme\nview, held by yet another dietary faction, is that people shouldn\u2019t be\ndrinking milk at all\u2014that it\u2019s a food specifically designed for newborns of\nother species, and as such inimical to humans.)\n\nTo the F.D.A., the real problem with milk isn\u2019t indigestion but contamination.\nPoor hygiene and industrial production are a toxic combination. One sick cow,\none slovenly worker can contaminate the milk of a dozen dairies. In 1938, a\nquarter of all disease outbreaks from contaminated food came from milk, which\nhad been known to carry typhoid, tuberculosis, diphtheria, and a host of other\ndiseases. More recently, between 1998 and 2008, raw milk was responsible for\neighty-five disease outbreaks in more than twenty states, including more than\nsixteen hundred illnesses, nearly two hundred hospitalizations, and two\ndeaths. \u201cRaw milk is inherently dangerous,\u201d the F.D.A. concludes. \u201cIt should\nnot be consumed by anyone at any time for any purpose.\u201d\n\nThanks in large part to pasteurization, dairy products now account for less\nthan five per cent of the foodborne disease outbreaks in America every year.\nSmoked seafood is six times more likely than pasteurized milk to contain\nlisteria; hot dogs are sixty-five times more likely, and deli meats seventy-\nseven times more likely. \u201cEvery now and then, I meet people in the raw-milk\nmovement who say, \u2018We have to end pasteurization now!\u2019 \u201d Katz told me. \u201cWe\ncan\u2019t end pasteurization. It would be the biggest disaster in the world. There\nwould be a lot of dead children around.\u201d\n\nStill, he says, eating food will always entail a modicum of risk. In an\naverage year, there are seventy-six million cases of food poisoning in\nAmerica, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Raw milk may be more\nsusceptible to contamination than most foods (though it\u2019s still ten times less\nlikely to contain listeria than deli meat is). But just because it can\u2019t be\nproduced industrially doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be produced safely, in smaller\nquantities. Wisconsin has some thirteen thousand dairies, about half of which,\nlocal experts estimate, are owned by farmers who drink their own raw milk. Yet\nrelatively few people have been known to get sick from it. \u201cIf this were such\na terrible cause and effect, we would be in the newspaper constantly,\u201d Scott\nRankin, the chairman of the food-science department at the University of\nWisconsin at Madison, and a member of the state\u2019s raw-milk working group, told\nme. \u201cClearly there is an argument to be made in the realm of, yeah, this is a\ntiny risk.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s largest raw-milk dairy is Organic Pastures, in Fresno,\nCalifornia. Its products are sold in three hundred and seventy-five stores and\nserve fifty thousand people a week. \u201cNobody\u2019s dying,\u201d the founder and C.E.O.,\nMark McAfee, told me. In ten years, only two of McAfee\u2019s customers have\nreported serious food poisoning, he says, and none of the bacteria in those\ncases could be traced to his dairy. Raw milk is rigorously tested in\nCalifornia and has to meet strict limits for bacterial count. The state\u2019s\nstandards hark back to the early days of pasteurization, when many doctors\nconsidered raw milk far more nutritious than pasteurized, and separate\nregulations insured its cleanliness. Dealing with live cultures, Katz and\nMcAfee argue, forces dairies to do what all of agriculture should be doing\nanyway: downsize, localize, clean up production. \u201cWe need to go back a hundred\nand fifty years,\u201d McAfee told me. \u201cGoing back is what\u2019s going to help us go\nforward.\u201d\n\nA century and a half is an eternity in public-health terms, but to followers\nof the so-called primal diet it\u2019s not nearly long enough. Humans have grown\nsuicidally dainty, many of them say, and even a diet enriched by fermented\nfoods and raw milk is too cultivated by half. Our ancestors were rough beasts:\nhunters, gatherers, scavengers, and carrion eaters, built to digest any rude\nmeal they could find. Fruits and vegetables were a rarity, grains nonexistent.\nThe human gut was a wild kingdom in those days, continually colonized and\npurged by parasites, viruses, and other microorganisms picked up from raw meat\nand from foraging. What didn\u2019t kill us, as they say, made us stronger.\n\nA few miles north of downtown Asheville, in a small white farmhouse surrounded\nby trees, two of Katz\u2019s acquaintances were doing their best to emulate early\nman. Steve Torma ate mostly raw meat and raw dairy. His partner, Alan Muskat,\nliked to supplement his diet with whatever he could find in the woods: acorns,\npuffballs, cicadas and carpenter ants, sumac leaves and gypsy-moth\ncaterpillars. Muskat was an experienced mushroom hunter who had provisioned a\nnumber of restaurants in Asheville, and much of what he served us was\nsurprisingly good. The ants, collected from his woodpile in the winter when\nthey were too sluggish to get away, had a snappy texture and bright, tart\nflavor\u2014like organic Pop Rocks. (They were full of formic acid, which gets its\nname from the Latin word for ant.) He brought us a little dish of toasted\nacorns, cups of honey-sweetened sumac tea, and goblets of a musky black broth\nmade from decomposed inky-cap mushrooms. I felt, for a moment, as if I\u2019d\nstumbled upon a child\u2019s tea party in the woods.\n\nThe primal diet has found a sizable following in recent years, particularly in\nSouthern California and, for some reason, Chicago. Its founder, Aajonus\nVonderplanitz, a sixty-three-year-old former soap-opera actor and self-styled\nnutritionist, claims that it cured him of autism, angina, dyslexia, juvenile\ndiabetes, multiple myeloma, and stomach cancer, as well as psoriasis,\nbursitis, osteoporosis, tooth decay, and \u201cmania created by excessive fruit.\u201d\nVonderplanitz recommends eating roughly eighty-five per cent animal products\nby volume, supplemented by no more than one fruit a day and a pint or so of\n\u201cgreen drink\u201d\u2014a pur\u00e9e of fruits and vegetable juices. (Whole vegetable fibres,\nhe believes, are largely indigestible.) The diet\u2019s most potent component,\nthough, is an occasional serving of what Vonderplanitz calls \u201chigh meat.\u201d\n\nTorma ducked into the back of the house and returned with a swing-top jar in\nhis hands. Inside lay a piece of organic beef, badly spoiled. It was afloat in\nan ochre-colored puddle of its own decay, the muscle and slime\nindistinguishable, like a slug. High meat is the flesh of any animal that has\nbeen allowed to decompose. Torma keeps his portions sealed for up to several\nweeks before ingesting them, airing them out every few days. (Like the\nbacteria in sauerkraut, those which cause botulism are anaerobic; fermentation\ndestroys them, but they sometimes survive in sealed meats\u2014botulus, in Latin,\nmeans sausage.) Vonderplanitz says that he got high meat and its name from the\nEskimos, who savor rotten caribou and seal. A regular serving of decayed heart\nor liver can have a \u201ctremendous Viagra effect\u201d on the elderly, Vonderplanitz\ntold me recently. The first few bites, though, can be rough going. \u201cI still\nhave some resistance to it,\u201d Torma admitted. \u201cBut the health benefits! I\u2019m\nfifty-two now. I started this when I was forty-two, and I feel like I\u2019m in my\ntwenties.\u201d\n\nPrimal eating has its detractors: The Times of London recently dubbed it \u201cthe\nsilliest diet ever.\u201d Most of us find whole vegetables perfectly digestible.\nThe notion that parasites and viruses are good for us would be news to most\ndoctors. And even Vonderplanitz and his followers admit that high meat\nsometimes leaves them ill and explosively incontinent. They call it\ndetoxification.\n\nLink copied\n\nStill, radical measures like these have had some surprising successes. In a\ncase published last year in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology, a sixty-\none-year-old woman was given an entirely new set of intestinal bacteria. The\npatient was suffering from severe diarrhea, Janet Jansson, a microbial\necologist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, told me. \u201cShe lost twenty-\nseven kilograms and was confined to a diaper and a wheelchair.\u201d To repopulate\nher colon with healthy microbes, Jansson and her collaborators arranged for a\nfecal transplant from the patient\u2019s husband. \u201cThey just put it in a Waring\nblender and turned it into a suppository,\u201d Jansson says. \u201cIt sounds\ndisgusting, but it cured her. When we got another sample from her, two days\nlater, she had adopted his microbial community.\u201d By then, her diarrhea had\ndisappeared.\n\nOther experiments have been even more dramatic. At Washington University, in\nSt. Louis, the biologist Jeff Gordon has found that bacteria can help\ndetermine body weight. In a study published in Nature in 2006, Gordon and his\nlab-mates, led by Peter Turnbaugh, took a group of germ-free mice, raised in\nperfect sterility, and divided it in two. One group was inoculated with\nbacteria from normal mice; the other with bacteria from mice that had been\nbred to be obese. Both groups gained weight after the inoculation, but those\nwith bacteria from obese mice had nearly twice the percentage of body fat by\nthe end of the experiment. Later, the same lab took normal mice, fed them\nuntil they were fat, and transplanted their bacteria into other normal mice.\nThose mice grew fat, too, and the same pattern held true when the mice were\ngiven bacteria from obese people. \u201cIt\u2019s a positive-feedback loop,\u201d Ruth Ley, a\nbiologist from Gordon\u2019s lab who now teaches at Cornell, told me. \u201cWhether\nyou\u2019re genetically obese or obese from a high-fat diet, you end up with a\nmicrobial community that is particularly good at extracting calories. It could\nmean that an obese person can extract an extra five or ten calories out of a\nbowl of Cheerios.\u201d\n\nBiologists no longer doubt the depth of our dependence on bacteria. Jansson\navoids antibiotics unless they\u2019re the only option, and eats probiotic foods\nlike yogurt and prebiotic foods like yac\u00f3n, a South American root that\nnourishes bacteria in the gut. Until we understand more about this symbiosis,\nshe and others say, it\u2019s best to ingest the cultures we know and trust.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s beautiful about fermenting vegetables is that they\u2019re naturally\npopulated by lactic-acid bacteria,\u201d Katz said. \u201cRaw flesh is sterile. You\u2019re\njust culturing whatever was on the knife.\u201d\n\nWhen Torma unclamped his jar, a sickly-sweet miasma filled the air\u2014an odor as\nnatural as it was repellent. Decaying meat produces its own peculiar scent\nmolecules, I later learned, with names like putrescine and cadaverine. I could\nstill smell them on my clothes hours later. Torma stuck two fingers down the\njar and fished out a long, wet sliver. \u201cWant a taste?\u201d he said.\n\nIt was the end of a long day. I\u2019d spent most of it consuming everything set\nbefore me: ants, acorns, raw milk, dumpster stew, and seven kinds of mead,\namong other delicacies. But even Katz took a pass on high meat. While Torma\nthrew back his head and dropped in his portion, like a seal swallowing a\nmackerel, we quietly took our leave. \u201cYou have to trust your senses,\u201d Katz\nsaid, as we were driving away. \u201cTo me, that smelled like death.\u201d\n\nKatz has lived with H.I.V. for almost two decades. For many years, he\nmedicated himself with his own ferments and local herbs\u2014chickweed, yellow\ndock, violet leaf, burdock root. But periodic tests at the AIDS clinic in\nNashville showed that his T-cell count was still low. Then, in the late\nnineties, he began to lose weight. He often felt listless and mildly\nnauseated. At first, he assumed that he was just depressed, but the symptoms\ngot worse. \u201cI started feeling light-headed a lot and I had a couple of\nfainting episodes,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt dawned on me very slowly that I was\nsuffering from classic AIDS wasting syndrome.\u201d\n\nBy then, an effective cocktail of AIDS drugs had been available for almost\nthree years. Katz had seen it save the life of one of his neighbors in\nTennessee. \u201cIt was a really dramatic turnaround,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t\nwant my life to be medically managed. I had a real reluctance to get on that\ntreadmill.\u201d In the summer of 1999, he took a road trip to Maine to visit\nfriends, hoping to snap out of his funk. By the time he got there, he was so\nexhausted that he couldn\u2019t get up for days. \u201cI remember what really freaked me\nout was trying to balance my checkbook,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even do simple\nsubtraction. It was like my brain wasn\u2019t functioning anymore.\u201d He had reached\nthe end of his alternatives.\n\nKatz doesn\u2019t doubt that the cocktail saved his life. In pictures from that\ntrip, his eyes are hollowed out, his neck so thin that it juts from his\nwoollen sweater like a broomstick. He got worse before he got better, he\nsays\u2014\u201cIt was like I had an anvil in my stomach.\u201d But one morning, about a\nmonth after his first dose, he woke up and felt like going for a walk. A few\ndays after that, he had a strong urge to chop wood. He now takes three anti-\nretroviral and protease-inhibitor drugs every day and hasn\u2019t had a major\nmedical problem in ten years. He still doesn\u2019t have the stamina he\u2019d like, and\nhis forehead is often beaded with sweat, even on cool evenings around the\ncommune\u2019s dinner table. \u201cI wish this weren\u2019t my reality,\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t\nfeel great that my life is medically managed. But if that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping me\nalive, hallelujah.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this part that incenses some of his readers: Having sung the praises of\nsauerkraut, revealed the secrets of kombucha, and gestured toward the green\npastures of raw milk, Katz has surrendered to the false promise of Western\nmedicine. His drug dependence is a sellout, they say\u2014an act of bad faith.\n\u201cEvery two months or so, I get a letter from some well-meaning person who\u2019s\ndecided that they have to tell me that I\u2019m believing a lie,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\nthe H.I.V. is meaningless and doesn\u2019t make people sick. That if I follow this\nlink and read the truth I will be freed from that lie and will stop having to\ntake toxic pills and live happily ever after.\u201d Live cultures have been part of\nhis healing, he said. They may even help prevent diseases like cancer. \u201cBut\nthat doesn\u2019t mean that kombucha will cure your diabetes. It doesn\u2019t mean that\nsauerkraut cured my AIDS.\u201d\n\nThe trouble with being a diet guru, it seems, is that the more reasonable you\ntry to be the more likely you are to offend your most fervent followers. \u201cThe\nRevolution Will Not Be Microwaved\u201d includes a chapter called \u201cVegetarian\nEthics and Humane Meat.\u201d It begins, \u201cI love meat. The smell of it cooking can\nfill me with desire, and I find its juicy, rich flavor uniquely satisfying.\u201d\nKatz goes on to describe his dismay at commercial meat production, his respect\nfor vegetarianism, and his halfhearted attempts to embrace it. \u201cWhen I tried\nbeing vegan, I found myself dreaming about eggs,\u201d he writes. \u201cI could find no\nvirtue in denying my desires. I now understand that many nutrients are soluble\nonly in fats, and animal fats can be vehicles of rich nourishment.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, this argument didn\u2019t fly with much of his audience. Last\nyear, the Canadian vegan punk band Propagandhi released a song called\n\u201cHuman(e) Meat (The Flensing of Sandor Katz).\u201d Flensing is an archaic locution\nof the sort beloved by metal bands: it means to strip the blubber from a\nwhale. \u201cI swear I did my best to insure that his final moments were swift and\nfree from fear,\u201d the singer yelps. \u201cBut consideration should be made for the\nfact that Sandor Katz was my first kill.\u201d He goes on to describe searing every\nhair on Katz\u2019s body, boiling his head in a stockpot, and turning it into a\nspreadable headcheese. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible song,\u201d Katz told me. \u201cWhen it came\nout, I was not amused. I had a little fear that some lost vegan youth would\ntry to find meaning by carrying out this fantasy. But it\u2019s grown on me.\u201d\n\nThe moon was in Sagittarius on the last night of April, the stars out in their\nlegions. Katz and I had arrived in the Smoky Mountains to join the gathering\nof the Green Path. About sixty people were camped on a sparsely wooded slope\nhalf an hour west of Asheville. Tents, lean-tos, and sleeping bags were\nscattered among the trees, below an open shed where meals were served:\ndandelion greens, nettle pesto, kava brownies\u2014the usual. In a clearing nearby,\nan oak branch had been stripped and erected as a maypole, and a firepit dug\nfor the night\u2019s ceremony: the ancient festival of Beltane, or Walpurgisnacht.\n\nWe\u2019d spent the day going on plant walks, taking wildcrafting lessons, and\nlistening to a succession of seekers and sages\u2014Turtle, 7Song, Learning Deer.\nEvery few hours, a cry would go up, and the tribe would gather for an adult\nversion of what kindergartners call Circle Time: everyone holding hands and\nexchanging expressions of self-conscious wonder. The women wore their hair\nlong and loose or bobbed like pixies\u2019; their noses were pierced and their\nbodies wrapped in rag scarves and patterned skirts. The men, in dreadlocks and\npiratical buns, talked of Babylon and polyamory. The children ran heedlessly\nthrough the woods, needing no instruction in the art of absolute freedom. \u201cIs\nyour son homeschooled?\u201d I asked one mother, who crisscrossed the country with\nher two children and a teepee and was known as the Queen of Roadkill. She\nlaughed. \u201cHe\u2019s unschooled,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just learns as he goes.\u201d\n\nThe Green Path was part ecological retreat and part pagan revival meeting, but\nmostly it was a memorial for its founder, Frank Cook, who had died a year\nearlier. Cook was a botanist and teacher who travelled around the world\ncollecting herbal lore, then writing and lecturing about it back in the U.S.\nHe lived by barter and donation, refusing to be tied down by full-time work or\na single residence, and was, by all accounts, an uncommonly gifted teacher.\n(He and Katz often taught seminars together.) As a patron saint, though, Cook\nhad left his flock with an uneasy legacy. When he died, at forty-six, it was\nowing to a tapeworm infection acquired on his travels. Antibiotics might have\ncured him, but he mostly avoided them. By the time his mother and friends\nforced him to go to a hospital, last spring, his brain was riddled with\ntapeworm larvae and the cysts that formed around them. \u201cFrank was pretty\ndogmatic about Western medicine,\u201d Katz said. \u201cAnd I really think that\u2019s why\nhe\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nAround the bonfire that night, I could see Katz on the other side of the\ncircle, holding hands with his neighbors. After eighteen years in the\nwilderness, he couldn\u2019t imagine moving back to New York City\u2014a weekend there\ncould still wear him out. Yet his mind had never entirely left the Upper West\nSide, and his voice, clipped and skeptical, was a welcome astringent here.\nAfter a while, a woman stepped into the firelight, dressed in a long white\ngown with a crown of vines and spring flowers in her hair. Beltane was a time\nof ancient ferment, she said, when the powers of the sky come down and the\npowers of the earth rise up to meet them. She took two goblets and carried\nthem to opposite points in the circle. They were full of May wine steeped with\nsweet woodruff, once considered an aphrodisiac. On this night, by our own acts\nof love and procreation, we would remind the fields and crops to grow.\n\nThere was more along those lines, though I confess that I didn\u2019t hear it. I\nwas watching the kid to my left\u2014a scruffy techno-peasant dressed in what\nlooked like sackcloth and bark\u2014take a swig of the wine. The goblets were\nmoving clockwise around the circle, I\u2019d noticed. By the time the other goblet\nreached me, thirty or forty people would have drunk from it.\n\nI heard a throat being cleared somewhere in the crowd, and a cough quickly\nstifled. Embracing live cultures shouldn\u2019t mean sacrificing basic hygiene,\nKatz had told me that afternoon, after his sauerkraut seminar. \u201cPart of\nrespecting bacteria is recognizing where they can cause us problems.\u201d And so,\nwhen the kid had drunk his fill, I tapped his shoulder and asked for the\ngoblet out of turn. I took a quick sip, sweet and bitter in equal measure.\nThen I watched as the wine made its way around the circle\u2014teeming, as all\nthings must, with an abundance of invisible life. \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the November 22, 2010, issue.\n\nBurkhard Bilger has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 2001.
