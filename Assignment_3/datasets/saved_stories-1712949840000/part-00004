Through\nan observational case-control study involving 285 first-episode psychosis\npatients and 261 controls, the research distinguished the effects of\nsubjective loneliness from objective social isolation.\n\nKey findings demonstrate that loneliness before age 12 doubles the risk of\npsychosis, with a notably stronger correlation in women. These insights\nemphasize the importance of early interventions targeting social connectedness\nto mitigate the risk of developing psychotic disorders.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n  1. Childhood loneliness more than doubles the likelihood of experiencing psychosis later in life, with a stronger effect observed in women.\n  2. The study differentiates between loneliness (subjective feeling) and social isolation (objective lack), showing loneliness as a potent early risk factor for psychosis.\n  3. Among women who experienced psychosis, those who were lonely in childhood were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, suggesting varying impacts on different types of psychosis.\n\nSource: European Psychiatric Association\n\nA new study suggests that children who felt lonely for more than 6 months\nbefore the age of 12 are more likely to experience an episode of psychosis\nthan children who did not, with women more affected than men.\n\nPsychosis refers to a collection of symptoms that affect a person\u2019s mind,\nwhere there has been some loss of contact with reality. During an episode of\npsychosis, a person may have difficulty recognising what is real and what is\nnot.\n\nIn women who had experienced a psychotic episode, loneliness in childhood was\nassociated with a significantly reduced likelihood of being diagnosed with\nschizophrenia spectrum disorders (aOR:0.155, 95% CI [0.048-0.506], p=.002)\nrelative to other forms of psychosis.

In some instances, psychosis may be a symptom of other mental health\nconditions, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or severe depression.\n\nSymptoms of schizophrenia are often categorised as positive (any change in\nbehaviour or thoughts, such as hallucinations or delusions), negative (where\npeople appear to withdraw from the world around them).\n\nLoneliness is defined as the subjective feeling of distress associated with a\nlack of meaningful relationships, regardless of the amount of social contact,\nwhereas social isolation is defined as the objective lack of social contact or\nsupport.\n\nIn an observational, case-control study, researchers assessed loneliness in\nchildren with the question \u201cHave you ever felt lonely for more than 6 months\nbefore the age of 12\u201d and differentiated this from social isolation by using\nthe \u2018peer relationships\u2019 item from the Premorbid Adjustment Scale.\n\nThe study sample comprised 285 patients who had experienced their first\nepisode of psychosis and 261 controls.\n\nKey findings from the study include:\n\n  * Loneliness in childhood was associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing a psychotic episode (adjusted odds ratio; aOR: 2.17, 95% CI [1.40-3.51], p=.002) and this association remained significant after controlling for objective social isolation in childhood (aOR:2.70, IC 95% [1.58-4.62], p<.001).\n  * The association between loneliness and experiencing a psychotic episode was stronger in women (aOR:4.74, 95% CI [2.23-10.05], p<.001) than in men (aOR:1.17, IC 95% [0.63-2.19], p=.623).\n  * In women who had experienced a psychotic episode, loneliness in childhood was associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of being diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (aOR:0.155, 95% CI [0.048-0.506], p=.002) relative to other forms of psychosis.\n  * In those who had experienced a psychotic episode, loneliness in childhood was associated with a greater severity of positive psychotic symptoms as well as affective symptoms (disturbance of mood) and worse functioning.\n\nDr Covadonga D\u00edaz-Caneja of the Institute of Psychiatry and Mental Health,\nHospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Madrid, Spain, said \u201cThere is\nincreasing evidence of the negative health and social consequences of\nloneliness in adults, but much less is known about the long-term effects of\nloneliness in young people.\n\n\u201cDespite their preliminary nature, our results suggest that childhood\nloneliness may serve as an early risk factor for later psychotic disorders and\nsupport its role as a potential target for preventive mental health\ninterventions from an early age.\n\n\u201cThis may be especially relevant considering that childhood loneliness is a\nprevalent phenomenon that appears to be increasing in recent years\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis study offers valuable insight into the association between childhood\nloneliness and first-episode psychosis. With the rise of digitalisation and\nsocial isolation, loneliness has become a pervasive issue affecting young\nindividuals.\n\n\u201cThe compelling findings of this study, which establish a direct connection\nbetween childhood loneliness and the onset of psychosis, highlight a\nconcerning trend and underscore the importance of addressing social\nconnectedness and emotional well-being from an early age,\u201d said Professor\nAndrea Fiorillo, President Elect of the European Psychiatric Association.\n\n## About this psychosis and neurodevelopment research news\n\nAuthor: Sarah Carter Source: European Psychiatric Association Contact: Sarah\nCarter \u2013 European Psychiatric Association Image: The image is credited to\nNeuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: The findings will be presented at the 32nd European\nCongress of Psychiatry\n\nTags\n\nbrain developmentbrain researchdevelopmental neuroscienceeuropean psychiatric\nassociationlonelinessmental\nhealthneurobiologyneurodevelopmentNeurosciencePsychologypsychosis\n\nShareTweetShareShareSubmitEmail\n\nNeuroscience News\n\nNeuroscience News posts science research news from labs, universities,\nhospitals and news departments around the world.
