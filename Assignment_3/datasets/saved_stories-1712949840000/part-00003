This is one\nof the several pro-Russia second-rate hacktivist crews that emerged during the\nRussia-Ukraine war and reportedly has ties to the Killnet gang.\n\nJust days after the DDoS incident, France Travail \u2013 the government department\nresponsible for registering and assisting unemployed people \u2013 disclosed a huge\ndata breach that exposed upwards of 43 million citizens' private information\ndating back 20 years.\n\nNames, dates of birth, social security numbers, France Travail identifiers,\nemail addresses, postal addresses, and phone numbers were compromised,\naccording to the department.\n\n  * French government sites disrupted by tr\u00e8s grande DDoS\n  * Record breach of French government exposes up to 43 million people's data\n  * Global taxi software vendor exposes details of nearly 300K across UK and Ireland\n  * Got an unpatched LG 'smart' television? It could be watching you back\n\nA month earlier, massive data breaches at France's Viamedis and Almerys, two\nthird-party payment providers for health care and insurance companies, leaked\ndata belonging to more than 33 million people.\n\nThe timing of these cyber attacks is worrisome for French officials, as the\ncountry gears up for the summer Olympics \u2013 and anticipates a deluge of hacking\nattempts around the Paris Games.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron has warned he has \"no doubt whatsoever,\nincluding in terms of information,\" that Russia will target the Paris\nOlympics. Russian athletes will compete in the Games, but not under the\nRussian flag \u2013 the country has been banned from participating because of its\nillegal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAlso this week, French cyber security officials visited Washington, DC, to\nconsult with their American counterparts and cyber security firms on Olympics-\nrelated cyber threats and how to avoid any disruptions from government-backed\ngangs and hacktivist crews. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * France\n  * Security\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * France\n  *
