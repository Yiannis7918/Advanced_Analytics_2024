Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data,\nwith Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted\nmaps with cartography or GIS software.\n\nNatural Earth was built through a collaboration of many volunteers and is\nsupported by NACIS (North American Cartographic Information Society), and is\nfree for use in any type of project (see our Terms of Use page for more\ninformation).Get the Data\n\nConvenience\n\nNatural Earth solves a problem: finding suitable data for making small-scale\nmaps. In a time when the web is awash in geospatial data, cartographers are\nforced to waste time sifting through confusing tangles of poorly attributed\ndata to make clean, legible maps. Because your time is valuable, Natural Earth\ndata comes ready-to-use.\n\nNeatness Counts\n\nThe carefully generalized linework maintains consistent, recognizable\ngeographic shapes at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110m scales. Natural Earth was built\nfrom the ground up so you will find that all data layers align precisely with\none another. For example, where rivers and country borders are one and the\nsame, the lines are coincident.\n\nGIS Attributes\n\nNatural Earth, however, is more than just a collection of pretty lines. The\ndata attributes are equally important for mapmaking. Most data contain\nembedded feature names, which are ranked by relative importance. Other\nattributes facilitate faster map production, such as width attributes assigned\nto river segments for creating tapers.\n\nSupported by:\n\n\u00a9 2009 - 2024. Natural Earth.
