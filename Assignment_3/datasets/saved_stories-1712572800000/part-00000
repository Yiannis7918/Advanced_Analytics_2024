He hoped to complete the journey in 240 days, running the equivalent of\nmore than a marathon every day.\n\nHe and his team had money, passports and equipment stolen in a gunpoint\nrobbery in Angola. He was temporarily halted by back pain in Nigeria. And he\nwas almost stopped in his tracks by the lack of a visa to enter Algeria,\nbefore diplomatic intervention from the Algerian embassy in Britain managed to\nsecure the required documents.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nWhat is next for billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott\u2019s giving?\n\nWorld Central Kitchen is saving lives with food but paying a price in blood\n\nAid organizations suspend operations in Gaza after World Central Kitchen\nworkers\u2019 deaths\n\nCook, who has spoken about how running helped him deal with his own mental\nhealth struggles, previously ran about 3,000 kilometers (2,000 miles) from\nIstanbul to Worthing in 68 days.\n\nHis African run has raised more than 690,000 pounds ($870,000) for the Running\nCharity, which works with homeless young people, and Sandblast, a charity that\nhelps displaced people from Western Sahara.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite hard to put into words, 352 days on the road, long time without\nseeing family, my girlfriend,\u201d Cook told Sky News as he started running\nSunday, accompanied by supporters who\u2019d come from far and wide to run the\nfinal stretch with him. \u201cMy body is in a lot of pain. But one more day, I\u2019m\nnot about to complain.\u201d\n\nCook said he planned to celebrate with a party, where British band Soft Play\nwas due to perform.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have strawberry daiquiris on the beach tonight,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be unreal.\u201d\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSuggested For You\n\nSheriff: Florida college student stabs mom to death because 'she got on my\nnerves'\n\nUndo\n\nTreppenlift-VergleichAd Content\n\nAdvertisement Riesa: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-Vergleich:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUndo\n\nQuickley scores season-high 31 as Raptors win 130-122, hand Wizards franchise-\nworst 64th loss\n\nUndo\n\n3 found guilty in 2017 quadruple killing of Washington family\n\nUndo\n\nMan found guilty but mentally ill in Indiana officer's killing gets time\nserved in officer's death\n\nUndo\n\nPolice say use of racial slur clearly audible as they investigate racist\nincidents toward Utah teamPolice investigating racist incidents directed\ntoward the Utah women\u2019s basketball team when they were near their Idaho hotel\nwhile in town for the NCAA Tournament say they\u2019ve found an audio recording in\nwhich the use of a racial slur was clearly audible.AP News\n\nUndo\n\nRangers tie franchise record with 53rd win beat Canadiens 5-2NEW YORK (AP) \u2014\nMika Zibanejad had two goals and an assist, Artemi Panarin had a goal and\nthree assists, and the New York Rangers beat the Montreal Canadiens 5-2 on\nSunday night.AP News\n\nUndo\n\nAd Content\n\nAdvertisement: sparfuchs-heute.de\n\nDieses \"Samurai\u201c Messer bleibt ein Leben lang scharf \u2013 Den Grund werden Sie\nnicht glauben!Advertisement: sparfuchs-heute.de\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: Enpal\n\nTsch\u00fcss \u00d6l und Gas: Jetzt gibt es nichts mehr, was gegen eine W\u00e4rmepumpe\nsprichtAdvertisement: Enpal\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: Checkfox\n\nRevolution bei PKV-Tarifen: So sparen Sie bis zu 3.000 \u20ac PKV-Beitr\u00e4ge /\nJahrAdvertisement: Checkfox\n\nUndo\n\nAd Content\n\nAdvertisement: Checkfox\n\nAnstatt eine teure Solaranlage zu kaufen machen Hausbesitzer einen\nAngebotsvergleichAdvertisement: Checkfox\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: Interactive Brokers\n\nOpen an Account Now!Advertisement: Interactive Brokers\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: PV Angebote\n\nNicht wahr?
