Thompson and Nico Grant \u2013 about how\nvarious companies are using data to build their AI models \u2013 so much so that\nthe publication has posted a few of its own summaries on the story already.\nBut one bit stands out to me above all else:\n\n> At Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, managers, lawyers and engineers\n> last year discussed buying the publishing house Simon & Schuster to procure\n> long works, according to recordings of internal meetings obtained by The\n> Times. They also conferred on gathering copyrighted data from across the\n> internet, even if that meant facing lawsuits. Negotiating licenses with\n> publishers, artists, musicians and the news industry would take too long,\n> they said.\n\nI mean what the literal \u2013 and I do mean literal, literally \u2013 fuck? I sure hope\nthis was some off-handed comment made in a meeting and was not taken\nseriously. But apparently the NYT has a recording of at least one meeting\nwhere this was mentioned. And well, it sounds like there was an actual\ndiscussion on this proposal \u2013 and/or around paying $10 a book for the full\nlicensing rights to new titles in order to ingest them into their AI systems.\n\nLadies and gentleman, we have now reached peak farcical dystopia. Just imagine\nMeta buying one of the largest book publishers, not as a money-making\nendeavor, or even as some sort of misguided goodwill effort after years of\npulling-the-football from various professional writers, but purely to get\naccess to the data in said books. Not beautiful prose. Data. I mean, if\nthere's beautiful prose, it probably helps Meta because good writing teaches\nAI to write better. But they also likely want some crap writing too, for\npeople who wish to write that way.\n\nNext, perhaps Sherwin-Williams will buy the Louvre in order to access some\npaint found in the stuff hanging on the walls there.\n\nPerhaps Meta was just looking around and noticing that they've been riding\nhigh, both in the stock market and in public perception in recent months while\nrivals like Apple are the ones being dragged. \"Hold my beer,\" says Meta and\nhatches a plan that will immediately vault them back into the negative\nheadlines...^1\n\nIt's hard to come up with a more innovative way to create bad publicity than\nthis idea of buying a book publisher to use its library to train AI. Can\nOperation: Kick Puppies be far behind?\n\n^1 Yeah, I mean practically speaking we get why this idea was in someone's\nhead. All of these systems need more data, and the \"better\" the data --\nmeaning higher quality in terms of writing because it would have been editing\nand published -- the better. But come on, no company, let alone a tech\ncompany, can utter, even in an internal meeting, such a proposal in this\nenvironment with a straightface. Beyond the regulatory concerns, there might\nwell be riots around this notion. Optically, it would be the worst proposed\nplan perhaps in all of human history.\n\n#ai #meta #writing #tech\n\n### Published by:\n\n### You might also like...\n\nApr\n\n07\n\n## Apple Odds & Ends Leading Up to WWDC AI Day\n\nApr\n\n04\n\n## Apple's Wall-E Future\n\nApr\n\n02\n\n## Apple's Social Force Ghost Feature\n\nApr\n\n02\n\n## No Joke, Yahoo Buys Artifact\n\nApr\n\n01\n\n## \"'Heck, Yeah,' Say Google Founders\"\n\nSpyglass \u00a9 2024\n\nPowered by Ghost\n\n", "frontpage": false}
