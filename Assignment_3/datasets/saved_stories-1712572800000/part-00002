Just a few years ago, serverless functions were\nrevolutionary. Today, entire applications are built on serverless\narchitectures, from compute to databases, storage, queues, etc. \u2014 with\nCloudflare leading the way in making it easier than ever for developers to\nbuild, without having to think about their architecture. And while the\nadoption of serverless has made it simple for developers to run fast, it has\nalso made one of the most difficult problems in software even harder: how the\nheck do you unravel the behavior of distributed systems?\n\nWhen I started Baselime 2 years ago, our goal was simple: enable every\ndeveloper to build, ship, and learn from their serverless applications such\nthat they can resolve issues before they become problems.\n\nSince then, we built an observability platform that enables developers to\nunderstand the behaviour of their cloud applications. It\u2019s designed for high\ncardinality and dimensionality data, from logs to distributed tracing with\nOpenTelemetry. With this data, we automatically surface insights from your\napplications, and enable you to quickly detect, troubleshoot, and resolve\nissues in production.\n\nIn parallel, Cloudflare has been busy the past few years building the next\nfrontier of cloud computing: the connectivity cloud. The team is building\nprimitives that enable developers to build applications with a completely new\nset of paradigms, from Workers to D1, R2, Queues, KV, Durable Objects, AI, and\nall the other services available on the Cloudflare Developers Platform.\n\nThis synergy makes Cloudflare the perfect home for Baselime. Our core mission\nhas always been to simplify and innovate around observability for the future\nof the cloud, and Cloudflare's ecosystem offers the ideal ground to further\nthis cause. With Cloudflare, we're positioned to deeply integrate into a\nplatform that tens of thousands of developers trust and use daily, enabling\nthem to quickly build, ship, and troubleshoot applications. We believe that\nevery Worker, Queue, KV, Durable Object, AI call, etc. should have built-in\nobservability by default.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re incredibly excited about the potential of what we can build\ntogether and the impact it will have on developers around the world.\n\nTo give you a preview into what\u2019s ahead, I wanted to dive deeper into the 3\ncore concepts we followed while building Baselime.\n\n### High Cardinality and Dimensionality\n\nCardinality and dimensionality are best described using examples. Imagine\nyou\u2019re playing a board game with a deck of cards. High cardinality is like\nplaying a game where every card is a unique character, making it hard to\nremember or match them. And high dimensionality is like each card has tons of\ndetails like strength, speed, magic, aura, etc., making the game's strategy\ncomplex because there's so much to consider.\n\nThis also applies to the data your application emits. For example, when you\nlog an HTTP request that makes database calls.\n\n  * High cardinality means that your logs can have a unique userId or requestId (which can take millions of distinct values). Those are high cardinality fields.\n  * High dimensionality means that your logs can have thousands of possible fields. You can record each HTTP header of your request and the details of each database call. Any log can be a key-value object with thousands of individual keys.\n\nThe ability to query on high cardinality and dimensionality fields is key to\nmodern observability. You can surface all errors or requests for a specific\nuser, compute the duration of each of those requests, and group by location.\nYou can answer all of those questions with a single tool.\n\n### OpenTelemetry\n\nOpenTelemetry provides a common set of tools, APIs, SDKs, and standards for\ninstrumenting applications. It is a game-changer for debugging and\nunderstanding cloud applications. You get to see the big picture: how fast\nyour HTTP APIs are, which routes are experiencing the most errors, or which\ndatabase queries are slowest. You can also get into the details by following\nthe path of a single request or user across your entire application.\n\nBaselime is OpenTelemetry native, and it is built from the ground up to\nleverage OpenTelemetry data. To support this, we built a set of OpenTelemetry\nSDKs compatible with several serverless runtimes.\n\nCloudflare is building the cloud of tomorrow and has developed workerd, a\nmodern JavaScript runtime for Workers. With Cloudflare, we are considering\nembedding OpenTelemetry directly in the Workers\u2019 runtime. That\u2019s one more\nreason we\u2019re excited to grow further at Cloudflare, enabling more developers\nto understand their applications, even in the most unconventional scenarios.\n\n### Developer Experience\n\nObservability without action is just storage. I have seen too many developers\npay for tools to store logs and metrics they never use, and the key reason is\nhow opaque these tools are.\n\nThe crux of the issue in modern observability isn\u2019t the technology itself, but\nrather the developer experience. Many tools are complex, with a significant\nlearning curve. This friction reduces the speed at which developers can\nidentify and resolve issues, ultimately affecting the reliability of their\napplications. Improving developer experience is key to unlocking the full\npotential of observability.\n\nWe built Baselime to be an exploratory solution that surfaces insights to you\nrather than requiring you to dig for them. For example, we notify you in real\ntime when errors are discovered in your application, based on your logs and\ntraces. You can quickly search through all of your data with full-text search,\nor using our powerful query engine, which makes it easy to correlate logs and\ntraces for increased visibility, or ask our AI debugging assistant for\ninsights on the issue you\u2019re investigating.\n\nIt is always possible to go from one insight to another, asking questions\nabout the state of your app iteratively until you get to the root cause of the\nissue you are troubleshooting.\n\nCloudflare has always prioritised the developer experience of its developer\nplatform, especially with Wrangler, and we are convinced it\u2019s the right place\nto solve the developer experience problem of observability.\n\n### What\u2019s next?\n\nOver the next few months, we\u2019ll work to bring the core of Baselime into the\nCloudflare ecosystem, starting with OpenTelemetry, real-time error tracking,\nand all the developer experience capabilities that make a great observability\nsolution. We will keep building and improving observability for applications\ndeployed outside Cloudflare because we understand that observability should\nwork across providers.\n\nBut we don\u2019t want to stop there. We want to push the boundaries of what modern\nobservability looks like. For instance, directly connecting to your codebase\nand correlating insights from your logs and traces to functions and classes in\nyour codebase. We also want to enable more AI capabilities beyond our\ndebugging assistant. We want to deeply integrate with your repositories such\nthat you can go from an error in your logs and traces to a Pull Request in\nyour codebase within minutes.\n\nWe also want to enable everyone building on top of Large Language Models to do\nall your LLM observability directly within Cloudflare, such that you can\noptimise your prompts, improve latencies and reduce error rates directly\nwithin your cloud provider. These are just a handful of capabilities we can\nnow build with the support of the Cloudflare platform.\n\n### Thanks\n\nWe are incredibly thankful to our community for its continued support, from\nday 0 to today. With your continuous feedback, you\u2019ve helped us build\nsomething we\u2019re incredibly proud of.\n\nTo all the developers currently using Baselime, you\u2019ll be able to keep using\nthe product and will receive ongoing support. Also, we are now making all the\npaid Baselime features completely free.\n\nBaselime products remain available to sign up for while we work on integrating\nwith the Cloudflare platform. We anticipate sunsetting the Baselime products\ntowards the end of 2024 when you will be able to observe all of your\napplications within the Cloudflare dashboard.
