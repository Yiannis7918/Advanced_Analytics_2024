Sad for two reasons: as a longtime\nRedis user and pretty early adopter, and as an open source contributor. I\u2019ll\npreface that I\u2019m empathetic to the challenges of building businesses around\nopen source, having been on multiple sides of this equation. I\u2019m also\ncognizant of the downstream effects of these changes that can completely flip\nhow a user adopts and uses a piece of technology.\n\nWhenever there\u2019s a shakeup in open source licensing, particularly amongst\ndatabases and related systems (MySQL => Sun => Oracle being the one that first\nsprings to mind), I\u2019ll hear the question \u201cWill PostgreSQL ever change its\nlicense?\u201d\n\nThe PostgreSQL website has an answer:\n\n> Will PostgreSQL ever be released under a different license? The PostgreSQL\n> Global Development Group remains committed to making PostgreSQL available as\n> free and open > source software in perpetuity. There are no plans to change\n> the PostgreSQL License or release PostgreSQL under a different license.\n\n(Disclosure: I did help write the above paragraph).\n\nThe PostgreSQL Licence (aka \u201cLicense\u201d \u2013 Dave Page and I have fun going back\nand forth on this) is an Open Source Initiative (OSI) recognized license, and\nhas a very permissive model. In terms of which license it\u2019s most similar to, I\ndefer to this email that Tom Lane wrote in 2009.\n\nThat said, there are a few reasons why PostgreSQL won\u2019t change it\u2019s license:\n\n  * It\u2019s \u201cThe PostgreSQL Licence\u201d \u2013 why change license when you have it named after the project?\n  * The PostgreSQL Project began as a collaborative open source effort and is set up to prevent a single entity to take control. This carries through in the project\u2019s ethos almost 30 years later, and is even codified throughout the project policies.\n  * Dave Page explicitly said so in this email :)\n\nThe question then becomes - is there a reason that PostgreSQL would change its\nlicense? Typically these changes happen as part of a business decision - but\nit seems that business around PostgreSQL is as robust as its feature set.\nRuohang Feng (Vonng) recently wrote a blog post that highlighted just a slice\nof the PostgreSQL software and business ecosystem that\u2019s been built around it,\nwhich is only possible through the PostgreSQL Licence. I say \u201cjust a slice\u201d\nbecause there\u2019s even more, both historically and current, projects and\nbusiness that are built up around some portion of the PostgreSQL codebase.\nWhile many of these projects may be released under different licenses or be\nclosed source, they have helped drive, both directly and indirectly,\nPostgreSQL adoption, and have helped make the PostgreSQL protocol ubiquitous.\n\nBut the biggest reason why PostgreSQL would not change its license is the\ndisservice it would do to all PostgreSQL users. It takes a long time to build\ntrust in a technology that is often used for the most critical part of an\napplication: storage and retrieval of data. PostgreSQL has earned a strong\nreputation for its proven architecture, reliability, data integrity, robust\nfeature set, extensibility, and the dedication of the open source community\nbehind the software to consistently deliver performant and innovative\nsolutions. Changing the license of PostgreSQL would shatter all of the\ngoodwill the project has built up through the past (nearly) 30 years.\n\nWhile there are definitely parts of the PostgreSQL project that are imperfect\n(and I certainly contribute to those imperfections), the PostgreSQL Licence is\na true gift to the PostgreSQL community and open source in general that we\u2019ll\ncontinue to cherish and help keep PostgreSQL truly free and open source. After\nall, it says so on the website ;)\n\npostgrespostgresql\n\n  * \u00a9 2024 Jonathan Katz\n  * Powered by the Anatole Hugo Theme\n  * Opinions are my own.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
