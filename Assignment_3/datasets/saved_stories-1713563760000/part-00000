Last year, 3,000 residents were evacuated\nafter a \u201csudden geological disaster\u201d that investigators blamed on water\ndepletion as well as the construction of geothermal wells.\n\nMany of China\u2019s old coal districts have also suffered as a result of\novermining, with authorities often forced to inject concrete into the\ncrumbling shafts to reinforce land.\n\n0 seconds of 52 secondsVolume 90%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n00:52\n\n00:52\n\nFlooded streets, trapped residents in Zhuozhou test China's disaster response\n\n00:52\n\nThe problem is not limited to China.
