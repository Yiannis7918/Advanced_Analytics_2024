Wages for teachers are low,\n> egalitarian and not based on performance. We pay physical education teachers\n> about the same as math teachers despite the fact that math teachers have\n> greater opportunities elsewhere in the economy. As a result, we have lots of\n> excellent physical education teachers but not nearly enough excellent math\n> teachers. The teachers unions oppose even the most modest proposals to add\n> measures of teacher quality to selection and pay decisions.\n\nAs I wrote, however, Wisconsin passed Act 10, a bill that discontinued\ncollective bargaining over teachers\u2019 salary schedules. Act 10 took power away\nfrom the labor unions and gave districts full autonomy to negotiate salaries\nwith individual teachers. In a paper that just won the Best Paper published in\nAEJ: Policy in the last three years, Barbara Biasi studies the effect of Act\n10 on salaries, effort and student achievement.\n\n> Compensation of most US public school teachers is rigid and solely based on\n> seniority. This paper studies the effects of a reform that gave school\n> districts in Wisconsin full autonomy to redesign teacher pay schemes.\n> Following the reform some districts switched to flexible compensation. Using\n> the expiration of preexisting collective bargaining agreements as a source\n> of exogenous variation in the timing of changes in pay, I show that the\n> introduction of flexible pay raised salaries of high-quality teachers,\n> increased teacher quality (due to the arrival of high-quality teachers from\n> other districts and increased effort), and improved student achievement.\n\nWe still have a long way to go but COVID, homeschooling and open-access\nvoucher programs have put a huge dent in the power of the teacher\u2019s unions.\nThere is now a chance to bring teacher pay into the American model. Moreover,\nsuch a model is pro-teacher! Not every district in Wisconsin grasped the\nopportunity to reform teacher pay but those districts that did raised pay\nconsiderably. Appleton district, for example, instituted pay for performance,\nOshkosh did not. Prior to the Act salaries were about the same in the two\ndistricts:\n\n> After the expiration of the CBAs, the same teacher could earn up to $68,000\n> in Appleton, and only between $39,000 and $43,000 in Oshkosh.\n\nThus, pay for performance is a win-win policy. Paying the best teachers more\nis good for teachers and great for students who see increases in achievement\nwhich pay off many years later in higher wages.\n\nHat tip: Josh Goodman on twitter who will surely agree about the negative\neffect of egalitarian pay on the relative quality of math teachers.\n\n  * 115 Comments\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * RSS Feed\n\n  * print\n\n## Comments\n\n### Etalon d'Silomar\n\n2024-04-12 09:06:22\n\n64| 1  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nGood teachers who can't get a higher wage by moving will presumably move to\ncompensate themselves in other ways.

And you are correct: If\nwe could rewind back to April 2020 knowing what we know now, most of the bad\nactors we do the EXACT SAME THING over again. Why? Because it earned them lots\nof money, gave them the political outcomes they wanted, THEIR kids actually\ndid better in school, and their wages outpaced inflation.\n\nThe pandemic was boon to a certain class of folks. It was devastating to the\nbottom 80%, with ripples that will be felt for decades.\n\nAnd the left just doesn't care. Core inflation (food, energy, housing) came in\nat 4.8% YOY, and at more than 8% (annualized) over the last quarter. In other\nwords, those in charge don't have control. The covid response, followed by the\nprinting of $6T, followed by even more batshit crazy spending will ensure an\nentire generation if young workers are screwed.\n\nMillions dead, 10's of trillions in losses. And nobody got in trouble. Out of\ncontrol inflation. Huge shocks to the workforce, from salaries to\nattitudes...and most economists all collectively shrug and admit \"Nothing to\nstudy here.\" And resume their dreams about block-chain powered LLMs and wonder\nwhy there aren't more women economics professors (while ignoring the ones that\nDO exist have plagiarized their way to the highest ranks of the Fed)\n\nThere are some true academics at work here. Larry Summers shared a NBER paper\nshowed that inflation, using the pre-1983 formula, would have put us at 18% in\nNovember 2022. And that the UMich consumer sentiment correlated strongly with\nthe pre-1983 measure.\n\nIn other words, what your brain is telling you at the supermarket checkout is\nmiles apart from what the administration is telling you.\n\nRespond\n\n### Jean Paul\n\n2024-04-12 07:45:25\n\n39| 1  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nSame in France.

Besides, the\nPE teacher is likely going to be a coach and earn extra money anyway. You\ncould be a pretty mediocre PE teacher but if you are a good football coach\nyour job and pay are secure.\n\nAnyway, if you read the paper (long and boring so hard to do) it looks like\nthe schools with flexible pay mostly just hired away the experienced teachers\nfrom neighboring schools. They didnt use any other objective measure of\nteacher quality. If every school went to flexible pay it seems likely that\nwould cancel out with maybe some wealthy schools coming out as winners and\npoor schools as losers. At that point it's really just a merit pay system and\nnot anything special.

Because the disciple people were so \"straussian\" -- I never\nunderstood their kind of character acting. And I wanted to. But that wasn't\nthe substrate of the blog. Positioning, for example. There was brand\npositioning, but it wasn't \"a\" direct reponse. As kind of civil disobedience,\nwhich is usally recognized, because its like a salmon swimming upstream, or in\nYemen. So no Blunt, either from Hooleys. But she is not a striped fish. Red,\nindeed. But other then that, I want to talk about public school salaries. For\ninstance, is htere turnover? I do not know. But then do not post here if you\ncannot be additive. So I would say, \"I am a public school teacher,\" and so and\nso, and try to honeslty make up a story. Why? Becuase you have to be\nrecognized. You cannot just \"value signal.\" Those are weak signals. Another\nsignal would be good writing. Marx, however, civil disobediences good writing\nwith kind of \"amoral\" critiques of the on-going culture.\n\nSo these were kind of toeholds, or bear hugs, occasionally.\n\nBut teachers salaries, for instance, compared to a doctor who went to medical\nschool, they don' have much \"intiial investmen.\" Well ha can fall on deaf\nears. tthough that was a solid political point (literal, as always.) \"literal\"\nas always. ha's checkmate.\n\nBut then unions span wide age groups for teachers.\n\nSo I would say ,that teachers like me, would say its hte \"story.\" Not the age.\nThiago and I had robust stories, about how much fun it is to be with a younger\nperson, like a student, which is common like CEO-Director of the BOard\nsituations. That duality. That is rich. WHere as for me, being of the same\nage, like with rayward, or even with someone older, kindo f carries, at least\nright becaue of simply real-unreality issues. Thinks like breakingdown crying.\nOf galavanting tantrums like smoking that cig with FInck. While still being\ngiven space.\n\nALso there are harder to thinks to understand. I am only myself, not someone\nelse. SO I do not understand always or why people would want to be with me. I\nhave many quibbles, and while I can make them ironic, they are real. I am not\na saint.

Knowing their significance is vital to an informed citizenry, but what\ndate a particular battle happened on is mere trivia.\n\n\\--Is the test properly designed?

In other words: What, fundamentally, is the\npoint of testing? Ideally we'd use testing to identify areas of weakness in\nthe student body's understanding of a topic, and focus teaching efforts on\nthose areas of weakness. Realistically, few teachers do that and I don't know\nof any administration that does. They use the test scores as performance\nmetrics for the class and the teacher.\n\n\\--How much time is spent on test-taking techniques? Classes like ACT prep\nclasses and the like basically teach students how to game the system. Not how\nto cheat, but rather how to take tests more effectively regardless of content.\nThere's not no value in this, but the majority of the value is going to be to\na handful of students (those with learning disabilities and severe test\nanxiety, for example), most of whom aren't the type to take these sorts of\nclasses (or at least to take them seriously).\n\n\\--How does one distinguish between student contribution and teacher\ncontribution to test scores? This entire discussion is focused on teachers,\nbut education, fundamentally, is what the student does. The teacher can\nfacilitate, but it's up to the students do decide whether they're going to\nlearn or not.

The fundamental problem facing the education industry right\nnow is that the needs of the population are shifting, and the criteria for\nmeasuring success are no longer valid. Until we get that straightened out, any\nassessment on how to improve quality is premature.\n\nTake gym teachers. Most of the ones I've known were merely coaches who were\nhanded a \"class\" that didn't really matter, so they couldn't screw it up.\nThere's logic to the idea that healthy bodies are necessary for healthy minds,\nbut the reality is that most gym classes don't do much for that, and any\nsociety that removes recess and other physical activities from children's\nlives doesn't really care about physical fitness anyway. Basically, as long as\nno one dies and the gym teacher meets the criteria necessary to coach whatever\nsport they coach, they've done their job.\n\nFor other teachers, the de facto criteria for quality are student test scores,\nhow many students are failing, and how many students enroll in college.\nFundamentally our schools are not educating students, they're training\nstudents on how to take tests. There's some logic to using test scores--if the\ntest measure stuff we think our citizen body should know, it makes sense to\nuse that as a framework (there are pedagogical theories on structuring classes\nthis way)--but, well, this is an economics blog. Any metric used to measure\nperformance thereby becomes a poor measure of performance. Student performance\nonly makes sense if you've never been a teacher and know nothing of population\nstatistics; there's a certain percent in any large body that is hopeless, and\nto blame teachers for student behavior is irrational. As for university\nattendance, this is perhaps the biggest con in our culture right now. The idea\nthat all students need a university education is false, pure and simple. If a\nkid learns what they need in high school to start working for their dad's HVAC\nbusiness, that should be counted as a win--he's a contributing member of\nsociety learning an increasingly valuable skillset--but currently it's counted\nas a failure on the school's part.\n\nRight now, if you want a job in corporate America, the most in-demand skills\nare interpersonal skills.

Again, it focuses on the teacher to the\nexclusion of the other components of a child's education. The child is the\nother major component to consider--and it's good for children to learn to work\nwith and for various types of people (of all the things you learn in school\nthis may be the most useful in the working world!).

Teachers can only maintain classroom discipline as long as\nthe administration has their back, and most simply do not. Any time Junior\nfails an assignment the parents come in breathing fire at the teachers and the\nadministration will usually cave (at least in the school districts I've been\nin).

But above a minimum threshold they are fungible. Teachers\nthemselves know this, even if they won admit it, which is why they oppose\nincentive driven pay schemes.\n\n*The most important aspects of education are the children themselves, Their genetic potential, family stability, cultural background. The next most important aspects are the management of the school itself - the level of discipline enforced, the curriculum, the maintenance of the physical plant. The individual variance of the instructor is very far behind the other factors.

The people that excel end up in\nmanagement and they teach others and replicate their methods. But the public\nschool system structure offers little opportunity for advancement in that way.\nManagement is elected by popular vote, rather given as a reward for\nperformance.

Also, I suspect the impact any one teacher can have is\nlimited because they cannot rise within the organization and reform how the\npublic schools are organized, they way they would in private enterprise.
