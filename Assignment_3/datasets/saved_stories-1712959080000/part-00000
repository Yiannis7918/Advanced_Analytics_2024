She\ntolerated my geeky interests with a certain bemused air1 but definitely didn\u2019t\nparticipate in \u2019em... not even setting foot inside a comic store on new comic\nday. She\u2019d wait outside until I was done... which could be a while, since I\nwas friends with several of the staff.\n\nShe came in the store exactly once, after I\u2019d explained that no, it\u2019s a pretty\nfriendly place... well lit, spacious, organized and with helpful \u2013 and clearly\nidentified \u2013 staff members who were willing to bend over backwards to make\nsure their customers were satisfied.\n\nShe was in there for less than 4 minutes before one mouth-breathing troglodyte\nbegan alternately staring at her boobs \u2013 evidently hoping that x-ray vision\ncould develop spontaneously \u2013 and berating her for daring to comment on the\nskimpy nature of the costumes \u2013 in this case, Lady Death and Witchblade. She\nfled the premises, never to return.\n\nWhen both the manager and I explained to him in no uncertain terms as to what\nhe did wrong he shrugged his shoulders. \u201cHey, I was just trying to help you\nguys! She couldn\u2019t understand that chicks can be tough and sexy! Not my fault\nshe\u2019s a chauvinist,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd that was when I shot him, your honor.\n\nSo with that example in mind, let\u2019s talk about a subject I\u2019ve touched on\nbefore: Male Privilege and how it applies to geeks and \u2013 more importantly \u2013\ngeek girls.\n\n### Male Privilege: What Is It, Exactly?\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m breaking any news or blowing minds when I point out that\ngeek culture as a whole is predominantly male. Not to say that women aren\u2019t\nmaking huge inroads in science fiction/fantasy fandom, gaming, anime and\ncomics... but it\u2019s still a very male culture. As such, it caters to the\npredominantly male audience that makes it up. This, in turn leads to the\nphenomenon known as male privilege: the idea that men \u2013 most often straight,\nwhite men \u2013 as a whole, get certain privileges and status because of their\ngender.\n\n(Obvious disclaimer: I\u2019m a straight white man.)\n\nIn geek culture, this manifests in a number of ways. The most obvious is in\nthe portrayal of female characters in comics, video games and movies. Batman:\nArkham City provides an excellent example.\n\nTo start with, we have three of the male characters of Arkham City:\n\nHere we have the brooding vigilante, the psycho ICP fan and The Doctor\n\nThen we have three of the female characters:\n\nHere we have the dominatrix, the crazy hooker and Exotic Fanservice Girl...\n\nNotice how the differences in how they\u2019re portrayed and costumed? The men are\nfully clothed and deadly serious. They are clearly defined: the mighty hero,\nthe ominous villains.\n\nThe women are all about sex, sex, sexy sextimes. With maybe a little villainy\nthrown in for flavor. They may be characters, but they\u2019re also sexual objects\nto be consumed.\n\nI will pause now for the traditional arguments from my readers: these\ncharacters are all femme fatales in the comics, all of the characters in the\nArkham games are over-the-top, the men are just as\nexaggerated/sexualized/objectified as the women. Got all of that out of your\nsystems? Good.\n\nBecause that reaction is exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nY\u2019see, one of the issues of male privilege as it applies to fandom is the\ninstinctive defensive reaction to any criticism that maybe, just maybe, shit\u2019s\na little fucked up, yo. Nobody wants to acknowledge that a one-sided (and one-\ndimensional) portrayal of women is the dominant paradigm in gaming; the vast\nmajority of female characters are sexual objects. If a girl wants to see\nherself represented in video games, she better get used to the idea of being\nthe prize at the bottom of the cereal box. If she wants to see herself as a\nmain character, then it\u2019s time to get ready for a parade of candyfloss\ncostumes where nipple slips are only prevented by violating the laws of\nphysics. The number of games with competent female protagonists who wear more\nthan the Victoria\u2019s Secret Angels are few and far between.\n\nThe idea that perhaps the way women are portrayed in fandom is aleetle sexist\nis regularly met with denials, justifications and outright dismissal of the\nissue. So regularly, in fact, that there\u2019s a Bingo card covering the most\ncommon responses. Part of the notion of male privilege in fandom is that\nnothing is wrong with fandom and that suggestions that it might benefit from\nsome diversity is treated as a threat.\n\nBut what is that threat, exactly?\n\nIn this case, the threat is that \u2013 ultimately \u2013 fandom won\u2019t cater to guys\nalmost to exclusion... that gays, lesbians, racial and religious minorities\nand (gasp!) women might start having a say in the way that games, comics, etc.\nwill be created in the future. The strawmen that are regularly trotted out \u2013\nthat men are objectified as well, that it\u2019s a convention of the genre, that\nwomen actually have more privileges than guys \u2013 are a distraction from the\nreal issue: that the Privileged are worried that they won\u2019t be as privileged\nin the near future if this threat isn\u2019t stomped out. Hence the usual\nreactions: derailment, minimization and ultimately dismissing the topic all\ntogether.\n\nAs much as my nerdy brethren wish that more girls were of the geeky\npersuasion, it\u2019s a little understandable why women might be a little reticent.\nIt\u2019s hard to feel valued or fully included when a very vocal group insists\nthat your input is irrelevant, misguided and ultimately unwelcome. It\u2019s small\nwonder why geekdom \u2013 for all of it\u2019s self-proclaimed enlightened attitudes\ntowards outsiders and outcasts \u2013 stil retains the odor of the guy\u2019s locker\nroom.\n\n### Related Posts\n\n  * 5 Mistakes That Keep You From Finding A Relationship\n  * Ask Dr. NerdLove: Was I Right To Leave Her?\n  * Wednesday Open Thread: Tell Me Something Good\n  * Ask Dr. NerdLove: When Is The Right Time To Approach Women?\n  * Ask Dr. NerdLove: Is This A Bootie Call?\n  * Ask Dr. NerdLove: How Can I Tell If Someone\u2019s Flirting With Me?\n\n  1. that I would later find out was the belief that she\u2019d be able to break me of such silly fancies []\n\n\u00ab Previous 1 2 3 View All Next \u00bb\n\nShare\n\nTweet\n\nShare\n\nReddit302\n\nPin69\n\n371 Shares\n\nPages: Page 1 Page 2 Page 3\n\nEnjoy my work?
