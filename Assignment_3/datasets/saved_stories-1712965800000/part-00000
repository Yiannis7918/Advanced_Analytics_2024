We pander to\nthe whims of others, hoping to please everyone (or at least find few enemies).\nWe try to behave affably, make the correct remark, and laugh at the\nappropriate times, all for the sake of winning the fancy of our company.\n\nThe approval of others becomes a top social priority and dictates many of our\nactions. At some point or another, most of us succumb to this tendency to\nbutter the rest of mankind\u2019s bread, which is fine. It\u2019s natural to do so. But,\nwe must exercise caution. You see, investing ourselves too fully into how\nothers perceive us can have terrible consequences.\n\n## When We Care Too Much About Others\u2019 Opinions of Us\n\nPeople who frequently seek the attention and praise of others are looking for\nan external validation of themselves. They want something outside of them to\ndeem them worthy, able, and good. Usually, this is because, at their core,\nthey are filled with self-doubt. So they do what they can to increase positive\nfeedback and eliminate negative feedback.\n\n> We pander to the whims of others, hoping to please everyone.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem with this way of thinking: When we act in such a way\nthat eliminates negative criticism, we also eliminate many, many possible\nlifestyles, actions, and directions from our realm of possibility. We become\nslaves to that which we believe others will approve.\n\nIt's hard to get over the idea that everyone won't like you. Shake off that\npressure and remember what you're worth with your new challenge, 3 Days of\nLetting Go of People-Pleasing, now in the Shine app. Here's a sneak peek:\n\nThis is a tragedy! Within all of us, there are numerous things we really,\ndeeply wish we could do\u2014travel the Earth, start a business, build an\nEarthship, become a stand-up comic/vagabond, etc. etc. But the vast majority\nof us don\u2019t do these things because we\u2019re worried about what others will say\nor think. We end up sacrificing our selves and our dreams to try to appease\nthose around us.\n\nFurthermore, it has been well-documented in psychological research studies\n(like this one or this one) that social anxiety directly correlates to an\nexaggerated desire to increase validation from others and decrease criticism.\nThis means that the more you care about how others will react to what you do,\nthe more likely you are to be socially discontented and uncomfortable. Instead\nof suffering these consequences, we should adopt a different attitude.\n\n## Let\u2019s Embrace Those Who Judge, Scoff, and Speak Ill of Us\n\nCaring too much about what others think of you stifles your ability to take\nrisks and disrupts your social satisfaction. The funny thing is\u2014whether we\ninvest energy into making others like us or not, there will always be people\nwho don\u2019t.\n\nHistorically, many of the most loved people were also among the most hated\nwhile they were alive. Jesus Christ, Abraham Lincoln, and John Lennon were all\nassassinated for spreading messages of love and understanding. So, I\u2019m\nsuggesting that we\u2019d all be much better off embracing those who will find\nreason to despise us.\n\n> Caring too much about what others think stifles your ability to take risks.\n\nIt\u2019s so much easier to do this than to waste our lives allowing the\nfaultfinders to dictate our actions. Moreover, being disliked by people is\nactually a sign that you\u2019re doing something worthwhile.\n\n## Being Disliked Means You Stand for Something\n\nWhen you simply mimic the values of your current company, your opinion stops\nbeing yours. You become a hypocritical piece of clay, molding yourself\nconstantly to try to fit in everywhere, and in doing so, retaining no shape to\ncall your own.\n\nConversely, being courageous enough to \u201cdo your thing,\" stand by your values,\nand live your own lifestyle (even if it isn\u2019t popular) is empowering because\nyou develop a strong identity. Gradually, you become satisfied and confident\nin your own skin.\n\n## Your Friends Will be True Friends\n\nWhen your top priority is to gain the approval of everyone, you\u2019re inviting\npeople to befriend a sham. You\u2019ve developed a fa\u00e7ade disguising your complex,\nidiosyncratic, untidy self. Most people won\u2019t know the you that\u2019s buried\nbeneath, and you may begin to forget that person too.\n\nOn the other hand, habitually presenting your genuine, vulnerable, weird self\ndoes nothing but strengthen your acceptance of who you are. The people who\ncall you friend will actually care about and believe in you, not some\ncharlatan.\n\n## How to Stop Caring So Much About Others\u2019 Opinions\n\nI may have convinced you that you shouldn\u2019t care as much about what other\npeople think, but perhaps you have no idea how to go about doing that. Here\nare a few tips.\n\n### 1\\. Stop Playing the Critic\n\nBefore you\u2019ll be able to care less about others criticizing you, you must do\nyour best to stop criticizing people. Realize that the act of judging others\nreflects your own intolerance. By rising above the behavior yourself, you can\nrealize how juvenile it is in the first place.\n\n### 2\\. Take Minor Social Risks\n\nStart doing a few things that you normally wouldn\u2019t do because of your fear of\nwhat others would think or say. Dance wildly at a show, voluntarily speak up\nin class, wear something edgy. Doing little things such as these will help you\nto understand that disregarding your fear of judgment and rejection is\nliberating! Others may have given you a harsh glance or whispered haughtily to\na friend, but it was okay. You\u2019re okay, and you did it.\n\nYour fears may never entirely cease, but you will learn that acting in spite\nof them was more important. The more social risks you take, the less you will\ncare. That\u2019s the God-honest truth.\n\n> Your fears may never entirely cease, but you will learn that acting in spite\n> of them was more important.\n\n### 3\\. Live by Your Deeper Values\n\nDo you know what you stand for? If you\u2019re still discovering the answer to this\nquestion, that\u2019s okay. However, from a young age, we all develop some form of\na conscience. We inherently sense what paths are right and wrong for us. Start\nsaying what you really feel and doing what you sense is right for you. We can\ndevelop a deeply rooted self-esteem by diligently upholding the values that\nmost deeply resonate with us. The more you seek to align your actions with\nwhat you feel in the heart of your being, the less you will invest in the\nopinions of the mud-flingers.\n\n### 4\\. Focus on Actual Outcomes\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling anxious or afraid of someone who may be directing\ncondescending energy toward you, ask yourself: What is the worst thing that\ncan come of this person\u2019s distaste? What am I really afraid of? Usually, it\u2019s\nnothing more than a bruised ego. In some cases (such as bullying, harassment,\netc.), more severe damage can be inflicted, and action must be taken, but most\nof the time, we\u2019re just afraid\u2014afraid of not being the best, the smartest, the\nprettiest, the fastest, etc. It\u2019s okay to not be these things.\n\n### 5\\. Love Your Good and Bad\n\nGive yourself permission to not be the things you wish you could be. Embrace\nthe fact that all of your qualities \u2014 both your boons and shortcomings \u2014 are\nessential to the equation that is you. As Kanye West once sang, \u201cEverything\nI\u2019m not made me everything I am.\u201d Insults damage us most when we define\nourselves based upon our perceived flaws.\n\nTake time now and then to number the ways in which you\u2019re halfway swell, and\nembrace the not-so-swell too. Or, perhaps look into the idea that \u2018good\u2019 and\n\u2018bad\u2019 are cultural or psychological constructions. They may not exist; we\nframe the world within the good-and-bad dichotomy because our minds naturally\nprocess things in terms of what they are not.\n\nOne Word of Caution Sometimes, people who dislike you have legitimate reason\nto do so. Being genuinely yourself doesn\u2019t do much good if you are genuinely\nan ignorant prick who refuses to change anything. Don\u2019t forget to keep an open\nmind to constructive criticism and realize you still have plenty of shit to\nlearn.\n\nWhat Will This Mean for You? This can mean about as much or as little for your\nlife as you like. The message boils down to this: Your top priorities should\nbe saying what you feel, and doing what flows organically from you (and c\u2019mon,\nhopefully helping others here and there).\n\nIf you do this, more people may end up disliking you, but you will likely be\nmore content, stand for something (not fascism, please), and derive a sense of\nmeaning from your identity that is arguably hella valuable.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pay any attention to what they write about you. Just measure it in\ninches.\u201d \u2015 Andy Warhol\n\n\u201cI pay no attention whatever to anybody\u2019s praise or blame. I simply follow my\nown feelings.\u201d \u2015 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nThis article originally appeared on Refine the Mind.\n\nRead next: There's a Better Way to Say 'No' to People\n\nYou\u2019re more than your anxiety.
