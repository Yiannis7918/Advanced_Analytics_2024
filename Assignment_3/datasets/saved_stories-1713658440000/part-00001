The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been\npresented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.\n\nVendors43 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adform\n  * Advanced store\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bannernow\n\n1-10 / 43\n\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit,\ncontent you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about\nyou (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 / 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It\nwants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on\nits mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have\npreviously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present\nyou with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n\nA profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having\nsearched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant\nadvertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors127 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * ADventori\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n\n1-10 / 127\n\nMeasure advertising performance\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an\nonline shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click\nwill be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will\nbe measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n\nYou are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an\n\u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the\napp of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 / 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the\nadvertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile\ndevices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors28 vendor(s)\n\n  * AdGear\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Amobee (Nexxen)\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bombora\n  * Clinch\n  * Crimtan\n  * Emerse\n  * Google Ads\n\n1-10 / 28\n\nDevelop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nA technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in\nmobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are\nconnecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads\nthat are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve\ntheir performance.\n\nAn advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer\ndevice.

More than 29 million \u2014 about a quarter of\ndomestic paying streaming subscribers \u2014 have canceled three or more services\nover the last two years, according to Antenna, a subscription research firm.\nAnd the numbers are rising fast.\n\nThe data suggests a sharp shift in consumer behavior \u2014 far from the cable era,\nwhen viewers largely stuck with a single provider, as well as the early days\nof the so-called streaming wars, when people kept adding services without\nculling or jumping around.\n\nAmong these nomadic subscribers, some are taking advantage of how easy it is,\nwith a monthly contract and simple click of a button, to hopscotch from one\nservice to the next. Indeed, these users can be fickle \u2014 a third of them\nresubscribe to the canceled service within six months, according to Antenna\u2019s\nresearch.\n\n## Inside the Media Industry\n\n  * NPR: Uri Berliner, the NPR editor who accused the broadcaster of liberal bias in an online essay, prompting criticism from conservatives and recrimination from many of his co-workers, has resigned.\n  * The Daily Beast: The billionaire Barry Diller is bringing in the former Disney executive Ben Sherwood and Joanna Coles, the former Hearst content chief, to turn around the digital tabloid.\n  * Netflix: Dan Lin, the streaming service\u2019s new film chief, wants to produce a more varied slate of movies to better appeal to the array of interests among Netflix\u2019s subscribers.\n  * Axios: Jim VandeHei, the C.E.O. of Axios, is becoming one of the first news executives to adjust their company\u2019s strategy because of the rise of A.I.\n\n\u201cIn three years, this went from a very niche behavior to an absolute\nmainstream part of the market,\u201d said Jonathan Carson, the chief executive of\nAntenna.\n\nThe change gives consumers far more flexibility, but the implications could be\nsignificant for the major media companies, especially if this behavior becomes\neven more common.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nTraditional media companies like Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery,\nNBCUniversal and Disney are trying to navigate the extremely bumpy road from\nthe cable bundle (which was enormously profitable) to streaming (which is\nnot). NBCUniversal\u2019s Peacock, for one, lost $2.8 billion last year.\n\nAs a result, the companies slashed investments in shows \u2014 the number of\nscripted shows in the United States in 2023 suffered its steepest decline in\nat least 15 years \u2014 and are raising prices to their streaming services.\n(Disney+ and Hulu both raised the price of their commercial-free tiers by $3 a\nmonth last year, for instance.)\n\nLess loyal subscribers could introduce a whole new level of complexity to\ntheir business. Last year, these \u201cserial churners,\u201d as Antenna calls them,\naccounted for roughly 40 percent of all new subscriptions and cancellations,\nMr. Carson said.\n\nThe companies \u201cclearly can\u2019t ignore them because it\u2019s such a big, active part\nof the market,\u201d he said.\n\nOne option for slowing the churn, executives think, is to bring back some\nelement of the cable bundle by selling streaming services together. Executives\nbelieve consumers would be less inclined to cancel a package that offered\nservices from multiple companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nDisney has found success by bundling Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ into one package.\nIt also joined several other companies, including Fox and Warner Bros.\nDiscovery, in announcing a sports streaming service scheduled to start this\nfall.\n\nImage\n\nLikewise, Mr. Meisel resubscribed to Apple TV+ for \u201cSlow Horses,\u201d featuring\nAimee-Ffion Edwards and Gary Oldman. Credit...Apple TV+\n\nThe services are also trying to keep subscribers hooked with \u201ccoming soon\u201d\nfeatures prominently displayed in their apps. Disney+ recently advertised a\ncoming documentary series from National Geographic (\u201cSecrets of the Octopus\u201d),\nand Apple TV+ is teasing \u201cDark Matter,\u201d a science-fiction series that comes\nout in May in its app.\n\nThis year, when Peacock was days away from showing the first streaming-only\nNational Football League playoff game, it promoted a special offer to deter\nnew subscribers from canceling: Sign up for a full year at $30, half the\nnormal price. (And according to Antenna\u2019s research, people who signed up for\nPeacock on the weekend of the game did not cancel en masse the next month; the\ncancellation rates were close to average.)\n\nThough the nomadic subscribers tend to skew slightly younger, and have a\nslightly lower income, \u201cthis is an activity that all types of Americans are\nengaging in,\u201d Mr. Carson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nKailyn Castro, a 32-year-old who works at a tech company and lives in\nBrooklyn, started piling up streaming subscriptions during the pandemic. She\nhad lots of downtime, she said, and kept \u201chearing about what everybody else\nwas watching, and I wanted to be able to watch those things as well.\u201d\n\nBut over the last year or so, as the pandemic faded, Ms. Castro found herself\nback to a busy social and professional life, and began cutting most of them.\n\n\u201cI feel like the world was really back last year,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were just\noutside more, interacting with humans more.\u201d\n\nPrice sensitivity is also a factor. Americans with a streaming subscription\nare spending an average of $61 a month for four services, an increase from $48\na year ago, according to a new study by Deloitte. The increase was due to\nhigher prices, not additional services. Nearly half the people surveyed said\nthey would cancel their favorite streaming service if monthly prices went up\nanother $5, the study said.\n\nAlicia Bianchi, a 38-year old lawyer in Michigan, said she had been culling\nstreamers over the last year, including Hulu, Paramount and Peacock, and would\nprobably let go of Max once she was finished watching \u201cThe Regime,\u201d the Kate\nWinslet HBO limited series that premiered last month. She said she was being\n\u201cvery mindful of spending,\u201d more so than she was a few years ago, before\ninflation rose sharply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nImage\n\nWhen Kate Winslet goes, the Max subscription probably goes, said Alicia\nBianchi, a viewer of HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Regime.\u201dCredit...HBO, via Associated Press\n\n\u201cI\u2019m able to turn them off so easily now, it\u2019s like why spend the money on\nsomething that I\u2019m not using?\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Bianchi, who has two young children, will not cancel Netflix, however. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t ever mess with my Netflix subscription,\u201d she said. Netflix\u2019s\ncancellation rate is much lower than those of its peers, according to Antenna.\n\nLikewise, Mr. Meisel, the scientist who canceled several streaming services\nafter giving up on \u201cPoker Face,\u201d said the Netflix subscription \u2014 as well as\nAmazon Prime and Disney+ \u2014 was off limits. (He also has two young children.)\n\nHe\u2019s otherwise enjoying his newfound flexibility around the other services.\nAfter canceling Peacock, he brought it back for a short period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow, with a pared-down streaming subscription list, there\u2019s a weight off his\nshoulders, Mr. Meisel said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this new system where you have to have a million different\nsubscriptions to watch what you want to watch,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to cancel\nto punish the companies who are making me do this.\u201d\n\nJohn Koblin covers the television industry.
