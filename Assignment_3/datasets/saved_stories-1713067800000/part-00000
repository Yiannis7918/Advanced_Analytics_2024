Deaths from prescription opioid use are nowhere near the level\nthat has been reported in the United States.\n\nLooking at trends in the medical use and abuse of opioid analgesics over the\npast two decades, Arnt Schellekens, MD, PhD, professor of psychiatry at\nRadboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, acknowledged\nthat there has been a \"slight rise\" in opioid prescribing in Europe overall.\nThis rise, however, has not translated into an increased mortality rate in\nmost countries.\n\nIndeed, in a retrospective study published 3 years ago in European Psychiatry,\nSchellekens and colleagues reported that in 15 of the 19 European countries\nexamined, there was no indication of an opioid crisis comparable to that in\nthe US. The exceptions were the United Kingdom (Scotland, Northern Ireland,\nand England/Wales) and Ireland, which had high rates of adverse opioid-related\noutcomes.\n\nPrescription opioid use in Europe varies widely, Schellekens, who is also\nscientific director of the Nijmegen Institute for Scientist-Practitioners in\nAddiction at Radboud University and director of research for the International\nCollaboration on ADHD and Substance Abuse consortium, told Medscape Medical\nNews. \"The healthcare systems are so different.\" European countries have\ndifferent problems to address, and the simple injunction to stop using these\ndrugs is \"not a solution at all,\" he added.\n\nCaution is of course needed when considering opioid use, Schellekens\ncontinued. The drugs are associated with a risk for addictive behavior and the\ndevelopment of opioid use disorder. There is generally a good system of care\nin place across Europe for people who develop opioid-related problems, and\nthis care is reimbursed in the Netherlands, Schellekens said.\n\nSUGGESTED FOR YOU\n\n\"I'm mainly concerned about the use of synthetic opiates\" such as fentanyl and\nnitazenes, he added. \"If they come onto the market, then it might be more of\nan issue.\" Data he presented at EPA 2024 indicated that these drugs are\nincreasingly being used in place of other drugs such as morphine, particularly\nin the Baltic states. The problem with these drugs is that they are riskier in\nterms of their tendency to cause addiction, complications, and overdose, said\nSchellekens.\n\n### Inappropriate Use\n\nIstv\u00e1n Bitter, MD, PhD, DSc, emeritus chair of psychiatry and psychotherapy at\nSemmelweis University in Budapest, said at EPA 2024 that he was \"worried\"\nabout the use of certain opioids \"not because of the situation in Hungary, but\nbecause of the news we are receiving from other countries in Europe.\"\n\nA colleague working in Northern Europe told Bitter that the semisynthetic\nopioid oxycodone was being used to treat people with chronic back pain. But\nopioids would never be considered for this condition in Hungary, said Bitter.\nMoreover, prior oxycodone use may play a role in the subsequent misuse of\nbenzodiazepines prescribed in an outpatient setting, Bitter observed.\n\nA gateway theory of substance misuse has been advanced, said Schellekens.\nAlthough addiction to one drug or behavior could theoretically increase a\npatient's risk for addiction to another substance, this effect does not\nnecessarily arise. \"If you switch in a proper way, then there's no need to\nthink that the patient will end up with other problems,\" said Schellekens.\n\n### Prevention Is Key\n\nPsychiatric disorders, pain, and problematic opioid use are associated with\none other. The reasons for this association are complex, and researchers\nsuggest that patients must be screened carefully before they are prescribed\nopioids.\n\nDespite this association, \"do not deny psychiatric patients adequate\nanalgesia,\" said Schellekens. Patients with a psychiatric comorbidity have\nbeen shown to require higher doses of opioids to have an analgesic effect than\npatients without such a comorbidity do. The former patients thus need a\nmultidisciplinary approach to pain management.\n\nCurrent guidance helps clinicians decide when and how quickly to taper opioids\nin patients who have developed opioid use disorder. Integral to tapering is\nthe use of psychoeducation and psychosocial support. Data also show that\nincorporating buprenorphine in place of the opioid being misused may help some\npatients.\n\nIn summary, long-term opioid use for chronic pain has no place in the\ntreatment of patients with psychiatric comorbidity, said Schellekens. \"On the\nother hand, you have people that have already escalated their opiates. And\nthen you should not simply stop it. But get in rapport with your patient,\nwrite down a tapering plan and schedule, collaborate to get it done.\"\n\nSchellekens and Bitter reported no relevant financial relationships.\n\nSara Freeman is a freelance medical journalist based in London, England.\n\n1\n\nCredit\n\nLead image: Tetra images/Getty Images\n\nMedscape Medical News \u00a9 2024 WebMD, LLC\n\nSend comments and news tips to news@medscape.net.\n\nCite this: Is Europe on the Brink of an Opioid Crisis? - Medscape - April 12,\n2024.\n\n###### TOP PICKS FOR YOU\n\nRecommendations\n\n  * How to Motivate Pain Patients to Try Nondrug Options\n\n  * Social Contagion Influences Buprenorphine Initiation for OUD\n\nWhat to Read Next on Medscape\n\nSpecial Coverage: COVID-19\n\n  * Latest\n  * Perspective\n  * Guidelines\n  * Drugs & Diseases\n  * Global Coverage\n  * Additional Resources\n\nBusiness of Medicine\n\n  * Can a Novel Med School Curriculum Curb the US Opioid Epidemic?\n\n  * Biden, Xi to Talk Fentanyl in City Gripped by Opioid Crisis\n  * Physicians React: Are They Taking Right Path Now With Pain Management and Opioids?\n\nRecommended Reading\n\n  * Diseases & ConditionsOpioid Abuse\n  * Drugsnaloxone\n  * Diseases & ConditionsOpioid Toxicity\n  * Diseases & ConditionsCBRNE - Opioids/Benzodiazepines Poisoning\n\nRelated Conditions & Procedures\n\n  * Opioid Abuse\n  * Opioid Toxicity\n  * Opioid Equivalents and Conversions\n  * CBRNE - Opioids/Benzodiazepines Poisoning\n  * Fast Five Quiz: Opioid-Induced Constipation\n  * Fast Five Quiz: Pain Management in Dentistry\n\nSLIDESHOW\n\n  * 11 Opioid-Related Emergencies: When Highs May Become Fatal\n\nExpert Commentary\n\n  * Should Opioids Be Used for Chronic Cancer Pain?\n  * Prenatal Prescription Opioids Tied to Increased Risk for Preterm Birth\n  * Managing Obesity: More Than GLP-1s or Bust\n\n### Comments\n\nCommenting is limited to medical professionals.
