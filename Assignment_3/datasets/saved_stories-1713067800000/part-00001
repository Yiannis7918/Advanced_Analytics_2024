The weather was good at both ends, but a cold front with\nthunderstorms reaching upwards of 45,000 feet into the sky lay in wait across\nthe route. At FL 390 only a minor deviation was required and our flight time\nwas only a few minutes more than forecast. We were home safe by 3 p.m.\n\n#### This Article First Appeared in FLYING Magazine\n\nIf you\u2019re not already a subscriber, what are you waiting for?

My almost 7,000 hours, of\nwhich 2,000 are in that type of jet\u2014and the Wright Master Pilot Award, are of\nno help. My recurrent training, the FAR 61.58 single-pilot checkride, is only\na month old, but the insurance industry has deemed me too old to fly single\npilot.\n\nI have looked for evidence that experienced older pilots have an increased\nrisk for mishap or mayhem, but I can\u2019t find any. I look at accident reports\nwith focused interest, but mostly I see runway excursions or accidents in\nairplanes piloted by younger pilots\u2014sometimes two pilots. Somebody, somewhere,\nhas decided not to take the risk with me.\n\nActually, that\u2019s not completely true. I do have a bid to insure our airplane\nfor single pilot operations for three times what I paid until yesterday\u2014nine\ntimes what I paid four years ago. The dollar amount pushes $100,000! So, yes,\ninsurance is available if you are beyond rich. Even if I were that wealthy,\nthat kind of price would be so offensive as to scare me away. That means that,\nfunctionally, I am unable to fly my airplane alone.\n\nIs the word \u201cusurious\u201d or is it \u201crapacious?\u201d No matter what you call it, it\nhas this pilot in an emotional tailspin. Several explanations are widely\nquoted. The Boeing 737 Max accidents and resulting insurance claims affected\nthe reinsurance market. If you have read the book, Downfall, or seen the\nmovie, you\u2019ll be angered to hear how a devotion to stock price drove the\nvenerable aircraft manufacturer to lose its way. The latest reason (excuse?)\nis the disruption caused by the war in Ukraine. Russians own a lot of private\njets, apparently. They get seized or impounded. Somehow this means I can\u2019t\nfly.\n\nWhy not have a copilot? It\u2019s a good question. I do enjoy flying with an\nexperienced co-captain. I have one in mind, but he lives 100 miles away from\nme and has a life of his own. Hiring a copilot is also an option.When I looked\nat how many days of flying it took me to amass 120 hours of flying last year,\nI was surprised: 68. If the average cost of a copilot including expenses is\n+$1,500/ day; that would be more than $100,000.\n\nIn one sense, a copilot would be very welcome. I can use another experienced\npro to help me decide which side of that thunderstorm to go around. Having\nanother set of ears to pick up the ATIS while I talk to approach control is an\nadditional advantage.\n\nIt is just that I don\u2019t use an airplane like a carefully programmed\nbusinessman. I might decide at the last minute to take a friend up on his\noffer for box seats at the World Series (I\u2019ve done that) or run another buddy\nover to Orlando to pick up his airplane (done that, too). To schedule a pilot,\nregardless of cost, requires calendar foresight and planning skills that I\ndon\u2019t possess. The freedom to fly a jet single pilot whenever and wherever is\na gift to be guarded.\n\n\u201cDick, you need to talk to my insurance company.\u201d I hear this often. I have\nused the same broker for more than 40 years and have had no interest in\nshopping around. For many years this broker has provided insurance via the\nsame carrier, and I have had no complaints, issues, or dissatisfaction. Three\nyears ago, when I registered the first threat to my single-pilot\n\noperations, I sent a letter. I sought to distinguish myself from a \u201cdoctor in\nBonanza\u201d (I was a surgeon). I detailed my Part 135 flying experience, and\nemphasized my flying to Part 135 runway, weather, and approach standards. I\ngot a reprieve back then\u2014but this year, no dice. All those years of loyalty\ncounted for nothing. I\u2019m told the carrier I\u2019ve used has changed partners and\nnew underwriting criteria have been established.\n\nSo, now what? It\u2019s tempting to push all the chips onto the table and just pay\nfor the privilege to which I\u2019ve become so happily addicted. Unfortunately,\nthat amount is just too much. Maybe it is time to come back down the aircraft\nmountain and get a piston airplane again. Plus, I\u2019ve been stymied by the FAA\u2019s\nmedical personnel in Oklahoma City for long enough. Somehow I can\u2019t break\nthrough their categorization of my relatively uncommon eye ailment and get\nloose from the specialissuance\u2019s death grip. (More about that soon.)\n\nIf I got an airplane that qualifies for Basic Med, I could save money, get rid\nof the onerous (in my view) FAA\u2019s antiquated criteria and learn to fly again\nbelow 18,000 feet and travel under 250 knots\u2014oh, boo hoo. I know: An immensely\nlucky aviator finds his luck is diminished and won\u2019t be graceful about it. I\nget what you\u2019re thinking. Still, it\u2019s a loss.\n\nThere is little question that these developments are a reminder of my\nmortality. No matter how fit you feel, or how often you go to the gym, one day\nyou find yourself a little hard of hearing. You look down and you\u2019ve lost a\nstep. Looking out, the world looks the same, but people looking in see an old\nman. Maybe a toupee would help.\n\nJoking aside, I\u2019m morose. It took me a long time to make enough money to own\nand fly a CJ1. It took three years of Part 135 flying to really understand how\nto use such a magnificent piece of equipment. After 55 years of flying, I\u2019ve\nfinally topped out. It has been a fabulous ride, but I won\u2019t lie: I am\nprofoundly sad.\n\nThis article was originally published in the February 2023 Issue 934 of\nFLYING.\n\nDick Karl\n\nDick Karl is a cancer surgeon who appreciates the beauty and science involved\nin both surgery and flying.
