At my age and\neyesight, it can be difficult to tell the difference between \ud83d\ude03, \ud83d\ude04, and \ud83d\ude0a when\nthey are as small as the text.\n\nIs there a way to use CSS to increase the font size of specific characters\nwithout having to wrap them in an extra <span> or similar?\n\nYes! Although it is a bit of a hack.\n\nThis relies on 3 CSS features: src: local(), unicode-range,and size-adjust.\nLet me walk you through it.\n\n    \n    \n    @font-face { font-family: \"emoji\"; src: local('Apple Color Emoji'), local('Android Emoji'), local('Segoe UI'), local('Noto Color Emoji'), local(EmojiSymbols), local(Symbola); unicode-range: U+231A-231B, U+23E9-23EC, U+23F0, U+23F3, U+25FD-25FE, U+2614-2615, U+2648-2653, U+267F, U+2693, U+26A1, U+26AA-26AB, U+26BD-26BE, U+26C4-26C5, U+26CE, U+26D4, U+26EA, U+26F2-26F3, U+26F5, U+26FA, U+26FD, U+2705, U+270A-270B, U+2728, U+274C, U+274E, U+2753-2755, U+2757, U+2795-2797, U+27B0, U+27BF, U+2B1B-2B1C, U+2B50, U+2B55, U+FE0F, U+1F004, U+1F0CF, U+1F18E, U+1F191-1F19A, U+1F1E6-1F1FF, U+1F201, U+1F21A, U+1F22F, U+1F232-1F236, U+1F238-1F23A, U+1F250-1F251, U+1F300-1F320, U+1F32D-1F335, U+1F337-1F393, U+1F3A0-1F3CA, U+1F3CF-1F3D3, U+1F3E0-1F3F0, U+1F3F4, U+1F3F8-1F43E, U+1F440, U+1F442-1F4FC, U+1F4FF-1F53D, U+1F54B-1F567, U+1F57A, U+1F595-1F596, U+1F5A4, U+1F5FB-1F64F, U+1F680-1F6CC, U+1F6D0-1F6D2, U+1F6D5-1F6D7, U+1F6DC-1F6DF, U+1F6EB-1F6EC, U+1F6F4-1F6FC, U+1F7E0-1F7EB, U+1F7F0, U+1F90C-1F93A, U+1F93C-1F945, U+1F947-1FA7C, U+1FA80-1FAC5, U+1FACE-1FADB, U+1FAE0-1FAE8, U+1FAF0-1FAF8; size-adjust: 300%; } body { font-family: \"emoji\", sans-serif; }\n\nHere's how it works.\n\n@font-face this tells the browser that we're defining a new font which will be\nreferenced later.\n\nfont-family this is the name we're going to be using as a reference.\n\nsrc: local('Apple Color Emoji') ... CSS can reference local fonts. We don't\nknow what device this page is being viewed on, so we've included a number of\npopular fallback fonts which should work with all major browsers. You can also\nreference a webfont if you want - although Emoji fonts tend to have a large\nfilesize. I've adapted this from Marc Forn\u00f3s' CSS and added a few more common\ndefault emoji fonts.\n\nunicode-range this tells the browser to use this font only for the specific\ncodepoints mentioned. This is where the magic happens.\n\nEmoji codepoints are complicated - especially when it comes to combining\ncharacters. You can see a full list of every sequence in Unicode 15.1. There\nare currently 3,782 different emoji.\n\nThere was some talk of using named ranges but that doesn't seem to have gone\nanywhere. So, instead, I've extracted all the Emoji codepoints and manually\ngrouped them. It's a pretty long sequence, and I'm sure I've made a few\nmistakes.\n\nsize-adjust this is used to increase or decrease the apparent size of a font.\n\nFinally, the body { font-family: \"emoji\", sans-serif; } tells the browser to\nuse the Emoji font (remember, this will only work on the specified Unicode\nrange) and then fall back to the defaults sans-serif font. Obviously, you can\nspecify whatever fonts you like.\n\nHave a play with it\n\nThis is a nifty little hack if you want to make Emoji (or any other text)\nbigger than its surroundings.\n\nI am indebted to \u0160ime Vidas who demonstrated this trick to me.\n\n## Share this post on...\n\n  * Mastodon\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * HackerNews\n  * Lobsters\n  * Pocket\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Telegram\n\n## The AlgorithmTM suggests:\n\n  * How To Use System Emoji With Webfonts?\n\n2014\n\n  * Banish the \ufffd with Unifont\n\n2019\n\n  * Replacing broken avatar images with background SVG Emoji\n\n2021\n\n  * Should \u20b9 be part of the Latin font subset?\n\n2020\n\n## 4 thoughts on \u201cUse CSS to boost the font size of emoji with no extra\nmarkup\u201d\n\n  1. 2024-04-14 12:37\n\n### Andy Piper says:\n\n@Edent as an older gentleman myself I appreciate this tip\n\nReply\n\n  2. 2024-04-14 12:49\n\n### Beko Pharm says:\n\n@Edent tell me.
