# **Advanced Analytics 2024 - Group 28**

This repository contains the code for all four assignments of group 28 for the course Advanced Analytics at KU Leuven. 


## Assignment 1
We constructed a predictive model to predict churn of Telco customers. We applied logistic regression and ensemble methods, specifically LightGBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest. For evaluation metrics, we used the profit @ top-20 and AUC. Finally, we compare models and select the one with
the best performance to predict customer churn on the unlabeled test set.
